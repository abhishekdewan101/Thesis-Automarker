Executive Summary 
Chinese Chess is one of the most popular board game in China and some other Asian 
countries. However, it is hardly to be accepted by western countries. That is because, 
unlike western chess whose piece is recognized by the shape, Chinese chess pieces 
are distinguished by Chinese characters that engraved on the piece, and most people 
in western countries cannot read Chinese characters. For the purpose of enabling 
people who cannot read Chinese characters to learn or play Chinese chess, this 
project looks at using vision to analyse the current state of the game and implements 
a system for real-time machine vision recognition of Chinese chess playing and 
reconstruct the board state in symbolic images. Also, the system could be used as 
vision system in chess-playing robot, or applied in some intelligent system which 
enables people playing Chinese chess against computer to create an interactive game 
in the natural world as opposed to via a screen.  
 
The system use a camera mounted above the chess board, which will monitor the 
state of the chess pieces and board in real time. Then it will extract static pictures 
from video frames to detect static board situation. No prior knowledge of the chess 
rules is used by the system, so there are no assumptions on how and where 
particular chess pieces are allowed to move and the initial configuration of pieces on 
chess board is not necessary to be provided in advance.  
 
MATLAB algorithm implementations and libraries are used for most of the image 
pre-processing and analysis, including the SVM classifier. The core technical points 
are: board calibration and piece recognition. This paper will review and compare the 
different solutions that have been done from previous literatures, and points out the 
weak points and strong points of each solution. Also, more robust and elegant 
algorithms are proposed and implemented in the research list as follows: 
 
1. Corner-line matching algorithm in Chinese chess board detection is proposed and 
implemented. (Chapter 6) 
2. A new Chinese chess piece recognition algorithm based on projection histogram 
in polar coordinates space and Fourier descriptor is proposed and implemented.

1. Introduction 
With the permit of technical conditions, people are constantly trying to find a more 
natural and convenient way to interact with machines. The development of IT 
technologies especially computer vision technique nowadays allows the way that 
people communicate with computer not only limits to interact through interface on 
screens. One of many ways that humans and machine can interact is through physical 
game play, using board games such as Chinese chess.  
 
Chinese Chess is one of the most popular board game in China and some other Asian 
countries. It has a long history and can be date back to 9th century, which is a 
precious heritage of Chinese culture.  Chinese chess is a two-player board game in 
the same family as Western chess. However, it is hardly to be accepted by western 
countries. That is because, unlike western chess whose piece is recognized by the 
shape, Chinese chess pieces are distinguished by Chinese characters that engraved 
on the piece, and most people in western countries cannot read Chinese characters. 
For the purpose of enabling people who cannot read Chinese characters learning or 
playing Chinese chess, this project looks at using vision to analyse the current state of 
the game and implements a system for real-time machine vision recognition of 
Chinese chess playing and reconstruct the board state in symbolic images. Also, the 
system could be used as vision system in chess-playing robot, or applied in some 
intelligent system which enables people playing Chinese chess against computer to 
create an interactive game in the natural world as opposed to via a screen.  
 
In the near future, the capability of robots will be broken down into more detailed 
capabilities or functions. According to different functionalities, future robots can be 
classified into: entertainment robot, utility robot, immovable robots, movable 
assistant robot, and human-like robot. Chess-playing robot is one of the 
entertainment robots. With the assist of camera, the chess-playing between human 
and robot can be very similar to gaming between human beings which make the 
robot feels more humanized and friendly. The premise of developing such kind of 
robot is to let machine make a better sense of physical world. Computer vision 
technique plays a pivotal role in such kind of application. Physical board games are a 
rich problem domain for human-robot cooperation research, because such kind of 
games has an intermediate and easily adjustable degree of structure. This research 
looks at the vision part of chess robot.  
1.1 Aim and Objectives 
This project is aimed to reconstruct Chinese chess game-playing in physical world. To 
achieve this aim, the project looks at using a camera to monitor the chess board and 
using vision technique to recognize and analyse the current board state. The result 
6 
 
will be shown in screen in symbolic images to reconstruct Chinese chess 
game-playing in real time. To achieve the aims, following tasks should be 
accomplished. 
(1) correctly calibrate the chess board 
(2) automatically recognize the identity of each chess piece on the chess board 
(3) display the state of chess board in real-time 
1.2 System Overview 
The system use a camera mounted above the chess board, which will monitor the 
state of the chess pieces and board in real time. Then the system will extract static 
pictures from video frames to detect static board situation. No prior knowledge of 
the chess rules is used by the system, so there are no assumptions on how and 
where particular chess pieces are allowed to move and the initial configuration of 
pieces on chess board is not necessary to be provided in advance. MATLAB algorithm 
implementations and libraries are used for most of the image pre-processing and 
analysis, including the SVM classifier. The core technical points are: board calibration 
and piece recognition.  
1.3 Technique Overview 
As is mentioned, the project is mainly about how to recognize and track real chess 
game playing. Jason E. [1] concluded three major approaches to recognize 
chessboard: differential imaging, modified board/pieces, and object recognition. In 
this project, the third approach is adopted as it is a more natural and also more 
elegant way. Also, further research into that approach will yield big improvements to 
robotic chess. Chess recognition is a complex task; it involves application of various 
algorithms and methods from different fields such as computer vision, AI, machine 
learning and signal processing. Therefore, several interesting problems are raised, 
including board calibration and piece recognition which is also the most challenging 
part in this project. Various solutions have been attempted, some of them require a 
modified chess set or place unreasonable constraints on board conditions and 
camera angles. Using computer vision technique to automatically determine 
arbitrary chessboard location and identify chessmen on a standard, unmodified 
chess set is a more general solution, and many works has been devoted [2] to that. 
This paper will review and compare the different solutions that have been done from 
previous literatures, and points out the weak points and strong point of each solution. 
Also, new methods are proposed and implemented in the research such as: 1. 
Corner-line matching algorithm in Chinese chess board detection; 2. Chinese chess 
piece recognition algorithm based on projection histogram in polar coordinates 
space and Fourier descriptor. In this paper, we will describe and discuss the whole 
system that implements all phases needed for tracking the progress of the chess 
game, including extracting valid frames of individual moves from the video sequence, 
7 
 
calibrate the chess board, locating individual fields, segmentation of chess pieces on 
the board and recognizing the identity of each piece and its position. 
1.4 Significance of Research 
As researches on computer vision technique mature, the problem of chess vision 
becomes more engaging to academic community for researching on chess-playing 
robot based on computer vision. [3][4] The results of this research have a certain 
practical application value. As the low cost of the system, it will be easily promoted 
to the market. As is mentioned, the Chinese chess playing robot can also enable 
people who cannot read Chinese characters learning and playing Chinese chess and 
can help popularizing Chinese chess game. In addition, this research outcome can 
also be used to do secondary development or applied in some intelligent systems. By 
studying chess robot vision system, research achievements can also be generalized 
into some other areas, such as product inspection, quality control, agriculture 
industry.

the system framework in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 gives a comparison of main stream 
approaches in chess recognition. Then, Chapter 4 reviews the previous solutions

previous solutions have been studied on Chinese piece recognition. In Chapter 6 & 7, 
we introduce our proposed algorithm on Chinese chess board calibration and the 
chess piece recognition respectively. Chapter 8 provides a brief introduction to the 
system software. Chapter 9 evaluates the works have been done. Chapter 10

2 System Framework 
Before moving on to the algorithm details of each module, this section gives the 
framework and working conditions of my system.  
 
As is mentioned, we use a CCD camera mounted above the chess board to monitor 
the state of the chess pieces and board in real time. Then the system will extract 
static pictures from video frames to do further detection. Following figures show our 
device and software GUI.

Fig. 2.3 System Flowchart 
Here we give description on each module in details:  
Frame Extraction 
As the video frames receive the consecutive game-playing process, there must be a 
lot of useless image frames. While the player hand moves over the board to pick a 
piece, it is considered that a valid move has not been finished yet and those image 
frames should be ignores. The task in this stage is going to extract and detect the 
image frames with valid movement over the chessboard, then send notification to 
other components about the current board situation. 
The valid static images of board situation can be detected by computing the image 
difference (by subtracting pixel values across entire images) of neighboring video 
frames. If the difference of image frames is below a specified threshold, then it is 
considered that the static image has been detected.

Pre-process 
Before we beginning to detect chess board and pieces, image extracted from video 
frames must be pre-processed. For board detection, image is firstly changed from 
RGB format to gray-scale image and median filter is applied to remove noise. Then, 
we apply “Canny” edge detector to extract edges on the image for further detection. 
As for piece detection, we first transform image format from RGB to gray-scale. Also, 
median filter is applied to remove noise and “Canny” edge detector is applied to 
extract edges. To increase the rate of circle detection, we need to apply 
morphological algorithm on edge images. Here we adopt dilate operation. After 
circles have been detected, image should be binarized. To get image threshold, we 
adopt OTSU algorithm.  
 
Board Detection 
This stage is going to recognize and locate chess squares on the board, which is 
needed for further steps of processing and analysis. Different board detection 
algorithms will be given in Chapter 6.  
 
Piece Segmentation 
This step serves for the purpose to segmentation each chess piece from the image in 
order to recognize the piece identity in next step.   
 
Detection of Piece Position 
Piece position can be detected after calibrating chess board and piece segmentation. 
 
Piece Samples 
In order to train the classifier to recognize pieces, we must prepare a bunch of 
sample images of each type of chess pieces. The system provides the function to take 
piece samples.  
 
Piece Recognition 
In this module, we use SVM classifier to recognize chess pieces. Detailed algorithm 
and descriptor representation will be described in Chapter 7.

3 Comparison of Approaches 
Many different solutions have been attempted in chessboard recognition problem. 
After background survey of existing approaches, Jason E. [1] summarizes three major 
solutions: modified board/pieces, differential image, and object recognition. This 
section will introduce each of the three methods and discuss their weakness and 
strong point. 
3.1 Modified Board/Pieces 
The most traditional way to implement physical chess-playing system is by the mean 
of pure electronic method which uses chess board and pieces modified or mount 
electronic sensors on the board or pieces. This is an efficient method, and individual 
piece can be recognized easily without mistake; electromagnetic boards can 
automatically move pieces. As it uses non-visual detection methods, it needs minimal 
computation complexity and can reach highest accuracy. However, it largely rely on 
external peripheral equipment, therefore the cost of the device will be high. Also, it 
requires changes to boards and pieces, which leads to that method only applies to 
tailor-made chess board and pieces instead of general ones.  
 
One of the examples is a chess-play robot called Robochess made by Ebrahim 
Jahandar [5]. The robot has a special chess board with 64 Reed Relay(Magnetic 
Sensor) placed in the bottom of board, and every chess pieces have a small magnet 
in the bottom that's not visible so with magnetic sensitive board, the robot can track 
piece movements. This is an innovative method, as it based on magnetic force. 
However, unlike other similar robots, it doesn’t use recondite methods such as 
computer vision for recognizing piece in chess board, so correct positioning of initial 
chess set is required.  
3.2 Differential Image 
This approach uses image process and simple computer vision method to infer 
moves on the board. [6] The core idea of this approach is to identify board changes 
by comparing before and after images to infer the move made by opponent. [7]  
 
The process of differential imaging is divided into following three steps (according to 
[1] and [8]):  
Step 1 Board Detection 
In order to identify piece position, we must know board position and segment the 
image of a chessboard into chess squares. The simplest method is to mount the 
camera directly above and orthogonal to the board. However, this constraint leads to 
12 
 
less user-friendly. To detect board from arbitrary camera view is necessary. Tam, et 
al., has proposed a method of board detection at a flexible camera angle with little 
constraint on camera view. [9] There is a bunch of different method existing to deal 
with that problem. The most frequently utilized method is Hough transform. [10] As 
the problem of board detection is one of the big topics, I will discuss the issue in 
details in Chapter 4.  
 
Step 2 Chess Squares Analysis 
We assume here that we have already segmented the image into a matrix of squares. 
Now we are going to analyze each square to identify the pieces. In order to do that, 
we need to consider the following two questions: [8] 
(1) Is there a piece on the square? 
(2) If yes, what color is it? 
Both of the questions can be answered by using thresholds depending on whether 
the square is dark or light. And different average threshold is used to determine 
whether a black piece or red piece is located on that square.  
 
Step 3 Piece Identification 
Piece identification is based on the square states of two adjacent chess board images. 
In order to determine the change on the board after one players move, we can 
subtract the pixel values of two adjacent images. From the difference of two adjacent 
chess board squares, we can infer the pieces from piece identities of last state. As 
you may expected, differential imaging approach does not actually recognize each 
piece. Instead, this method infers each piece by the changes happened on the chess 
board squares. This is the key idea of differential imaging approach.  
 
The primary advantages of differential imaging approach are that it is the simplest 
implementation which doesn’t need extra electronic devices and complex algorithms, 
and also, this approach works with almost any chess set.  
 
As this approach infers the identity of each piece by comparing the between images 
before and after a move rather than truly recognizing each piece, so this method has 
low flexibility and any mistake happened in the interim of game playing will lead to 
breakdown of the whole situation. Also, as we distinguish each square state by using 
thresholds to compare with the lightness of squares which is much susceptible to 
lighting variations, so the stability is easily affected by the lighting condition. In 
addition, this approach requires that the game must started from the beginning, as 
computer needs to know the identity of each piece according to their initial position. 
However, if a game starts in an arbitrary position, it will require manual entry of 
piece locations into the chess engine. This is the weak point of differential imaging 
approach. 
13 
 
3.3 Object Recognition 
The object recognition approach shares commonality with the differential image 
method in the areas of board detection. [1] They differ in the step of piece 
identification.  
 
Object recognition mainly uses computer vision and pattern recognizing means to 
really recognize each piece rather than to reason each piece by using the 
differentiation. This is the most challenging and complex approach. And there is a 
plenty of methods can be used to implement object recognition. Meanwhile, further 
research into that approach will yield big improvements to robotic chess. Also, most 
of the methods prefer the camera view at a perspective angle rather than a simple 
top-down view, in order to recognize the identities of the pieces effectively. In 
addition, almost all of the current recognizers need to be pre-trained or told the 
features of each piece.  
 
Drawbacks include the complexity of the implementation of recognizing algorithm 
and the requirement of pre-training of classifier. Meanwhile, the advantages of this 
method are obvious. This approach can recognize individual pieces; the system can 
be used with arbitrary board configurations, which provides more flexibility; arbitrary 
chess sets are supported, which ensures the adaptability; less constraint on camera 
view angle, which simplifies camera mounting and setup; move of camera during the 
chess-playing are allowed, which reveals the better robustness. The advantages 
outweigh the disadvantages of this approach. Comparing with the previous two 
solutions, object recognition appears to be more worthwhile to be researched and 
discussed. As this method allows building a robust system, and is easier to setup due 
to the simplicity of hardware. Therefore, this approach will be adapted and 
implemented in this project. 
 
As object recognition is a big topic, a more specific and detailed description of 
different algorithms and ideas on this topic will be given in Chapter 5.

4 Review of Board Calibration Methods 
Before any further processing, the problem that confronts us is chess board 
calibration. In this step, we should detect squares on the chess board from video 
frame and map the chess board to the chess notation. In order to let our vision 
algorithm to adapt to any kind of chessboard, the initial chessboard segmentation 
must be capable of recognizing the squares on chess board under the following 
situations: 
(1) Various square sizes 
(2) Various chessboard orientations 
(3) Various light conditions 
(4) Some squares may be partially occluded 
(5) Noise may appears on the chess image 
Various approaches have been attempted to deal with board detection. In [1], a 
Hough transform-like technique is used to detect line in order to calibrate board 
squares. In [9], the grid detection method is proposed. In [11], corner detection 
method to locate board. In [12], the system use an OpenCV embedded function to 
detect chess board. In [13], pixel classification method is adopted to determine the 
class to which each pixel belongs by means of the (color) attributes of these pixels. In 
[8], a template matching based method was used to detect the corner of the grid. 
Various approaches used to calibrate chess board are generally divided into three 
groups:  
(1) corner-based detection 
(2) line-based detection 
(3) pixel classification 
 
This section will discuss all of those approaches and compare the strong points and 
weak points of each approach. 
4.1 Line-based Detection 
Line-based detection method works by detecting the lines of the chessboard. Then 
use the line equations to form squares on the board. Line-based detection can be 
divided into following steps (Figure 4.1).  
15 
 
 
Fig. 4.1 Major steps used in line-based board detection algorithm 
Step 1 – Image Pre-process 
Before formally beginning to apply line-based detection approach, some basic filters 
must be applied to the image first, so as to make the detecting process more efficient 
and reduce noise. According to Jason E. [1], following filters may be needed: 
(1) A grayscale copy of the input image is used for both line detection and 
final board comparison; 
(2) The image histogram is equalized to normalize brightness and increase 
contrast; 
(3) Erosion and dilation filters are applied in succession to smooth out noise 
in the image and to reduce unnecessary lines from being detected. ” 
 
Step 2 – Edge Detection 
Before line detection, some form of edge detection should be applied on the filtered 
image. The most commonly-used edge detection algorithms are Canny edge and 
Marr-Hildreth detectors. Mohsen Sharifi, et al., [14] gives description and 
comparison of various edge detection algorithms. 
 
Step 3 – Line Detection 
To detect lines on chess board, Hough line transform [10] is the most frequently 
utilized method.  
 
Step 4 – board calibration 
Square on the chess board can be detected by following steps: [1]  
(1) Match a horizontal and a vertical line that intersect in the upper left 
quadrant; 
(2) Select a vertical line that interests with the same horizontal line in the upper 
right quadrant; 
(3) Select a horizontal line that intersects with the last vertical line in the lower 
16 
 
right quadrant.  
(4) The lower left intersection is found using the first vertical line and the last 
horizontal line.  
 
The main advantages of line-based detector is that the detection probability is higher 
comparing with corner-based detector (which will be discussed later), especially 
when they are applied to calibrate populated chess board taken from a perspective 
angle view, as it is unlikely that a line is completely blocked by chessman. Also, this 
method is less sensitive to noise, since a line will have significantly higher count than 
isolated pixels.  
 
However, the line-based detection method is sometimes unstable due to image 
distortion (lines are not straight). Although line-based technique works better than 
corner-based technique, the method alone will not perform well when the occlusion 
is high enough so that lines are not guaranteed to exist. To improve the reliability, 
Tam, et al., has proposed a grid detection algorithm to make better prediction, which 
combines line-based grid detection with knowledge of the chessboard. [9] The 
detailed description will be given in next section.  
4.2 Grid-based Detection 
Grid detection method [9] is proposed to overcome the occlusion problem. As when 
we use pure line detection method on a populated chess board from a lower angle 
view, the visibility of a number of lines will not be guaranteed. However, we can 
predict the missing lines by using the domain knowledge of the chessboard. Grid 
detection method is based on following four knowledge of the chessboard: 
(1) A chessboard has none lines in horizontal and vertical direction respectively. 
(2) Despite of the existing of perspective distortion, the size of neighborhood 
grid should be roughly approximate. 
(3) For any square within the grid, there will be intersections where board lines 
meet.  
(4) Each square contains the complete geometric information of the whole 
chessboard. If the edge of the board is known, only a single square is needed 
to grow into a complete board. Figure 4.2 illustrate the how the square 
above the current one can be constructed using simple construction lines. 
17 
 
 
Fig. 4.2 Steps showing how the square above the current one can be 
constructed using simple construction line 
Grid-based detection nearly eliminates false positives and misses, which is a big 
improvement to line-based detection method. 
4.3 Corner-based Detection 
An alternative method to calibrate chessboard is corner detection. Typical corner 
detection methods include Harris corner detector, SUSAN [15] corner detector (a 
method based on the smallest uni-value segment assimilating nucleus) and template 
matching-based [8] corner detector (which will be discussed in section 4.6).  
 
Harris corner detection and SUSAN corner detection methods are quite similar. Both 
of the methods compare each pixel to its surrounding to check if it is a corner. 
However, the two methods differ in detection scale. Harris corner detection method 
compares a small neighborhood with its immediate neighbor, whereas SUSAN 
method compares the current pixel with its surrounding. [9] An example of applying 
corner detection in chess-playing system can be found in [11].  
 
Comparing with line-based detection technique, the main advantages of the 
corner-based detector is high resistance to against camera distortion, as a corner can 
hardly be affected by image warping.  
 
Whereas, the weak points are also obvious, corners are not guaranteed to be 
detected on a populated chessboard from perspective camera view. Moreover, the 
corners returned would have no information as to which points are co-linear with 
other points. Generally speaking, for most system, line-based detection algorithm 
18 
 
works better than corner-based detector.  
4.4 Template Matching-based Detection 
Template matching-based detection method (proposed by T. Cour, et al. [8]) is a kind 
of corner-based detection method. We use templates to detect the corners of the 
chess square. An example template is show as following Figure 4.3.  
 
a               b              c 
Fig. 4.3 sample template 
Figure 4.3 (a) shows a corner in between four squares. Figure 4.3 (b) shows typical 
values of grey levels around a corner. Figure 4.3 (c) shows the corresponding 
template with 5x5 coefficients. To deal with light condition, we use a threshold. As 
grey level values are seldom significant at the frontier between two squares, the 
coefficients of the template in the two median lines are equal to zero. Any pixel that 
matches those templates will be detected. 
 
Now, we have a list of corners. But, we don’t know squares, and those corners are 
not ordered in a matrix. Corners on the border of the chess board are usually not 
detected. Due to light conditions, some corners may not have been detected. Also, 
some corners may be detected by mistake, due to the noise. In order to deal with the 
above issues, the algorithm will search for maximum alignments of corners in both 
horizontal and vertical direction and then eliminate corners that don’t fit in those 
alignments. Also, square size can be calculated by computing the average distance 
between two consecutive lines with the same direction.  
4.5 Pixel Classification 
David U. [13] uses pixel classification method in his chess-playing robot to recognize 
chess board. As David U. describe, “Pixel classification attempts to determine the 
class to which each pixel belongs by means of the (color) attributes of these pixels.”  
Step 1 
Before being able to classify pixels, color domain for each class should be computed. 
We define four classed: (1) light square (2) dark square (3) light piece (4) dark piece. 
However, the classes ‘light square’ and ‘light piece’ overlap, when pixels are 
represented in RBG color space, which will lead to misclassification. To deal with that 
problem, we therefore switch the chessboard image from RBG color space to a HSB 
(Hue, Saturation, and Brightness) color space. After computing the color domain of 
19 
 
each class, we than classify all pixels in the image. A sample result of this step is 
showed in Figure 4.4. 
 
Fig. 4.4  
Step 2 
Now, we are going to calibrate chessboard. To position the board and pieces in the 
image, we firstly extract a reference image that has the same color as the dark 
squares, and then the algorithm performs a search at the extremities of the image 
for pixels belonging to the ‘dark square’ class to detect corners. Based on the 
knowledge that all squares are equal in size and there are 8 squares for each 
dimension, we can than easily determine the position of each square by means of 
interpolation. A sample result is illustrated in Figure 4.5 
 
Fig. 4.5  
Step 3 
After determining squares, we can now analysis each square to detect whether a 
square is occupied by a piece and, if yes, what color is the piece. This can be achieved 
by calculating the number of pixels within a square that belongs to the class ‘light 
piece’ and ‘dark piece’ and compare the number to a particular threshold to decide if 
a piece on that square.  
 
Step 4 
Now, we get a list of squares and know whether they are occupied by a chess piece 
of a particular color. However, we still don’t know the type of each piece on the 
squares. In order to determine the type of each piece, we can simply compare 
current situation with the situation before the last move, which is similar to the 
method of ‘differential image’ in Section 2.2.  
 
This is a simple and robust method for recognizing board situations. Whereas, there 
are some constraints such as, the camera must be mounted about the chessboard; 
the algorithm requires that the game must started from the beginning, as computer 
needs to know the identity of each piece according to their initial position, but if a 
game starts in an arbitrary position, it will require manual entry of piece locations 
20 
 
into the chess engine. 
4.6 Square Detector 
In [16], the square detector is used to find chess squares. To cope with the rotation 
and scale, the system generates 20 square templates by rotating a square in different 
angles. We can then extract histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) features and 
obtain 20 HOG square training templates. In addition, different chess board and 
different view heights will result in different image scale. To fit with different scaling 
level of the squares, the system should chose the image scale automatically during 
the test time to ensure that square size in the image corresponds approximately to 
the size of square training templates. To do that, we firstly generate an image 
pyramid with different pre-specified scales, and then apply the square detector to 
the image pyramid to find the overall-most likely scale level.  
4.7 Cross Corner Detection based on Projection 
After image binarization, we can find it consists of lines, circles, and characters. 
Based on the method of Hough transformation as 3.1 describes, we design an 
algorithm to find 9 x 10 cross corners. It is proven by experiment that Hough 
transform method is easily affected by chess pieces on the board and it will produce 
some noise line. Also, the speed of calculation cannot satisfy real-time detection. 
Therefore, Fenglei Xu [17] in his thesis proposed a Chinese chess board corner detection 
method based on project.  
 
Here is a brief description of the rationale. After preprocessing the image, we scan 
the image in horizontal direction from up to down and record the number of pixels of 
each line. After applying the projection method, we can get the distribution shown 
on Figure 4.6. As we can see, the black bar represents the number of black pixels on 
each line. The peaks on the image represent the board lines. Therefore, if we can find 
those peaks on the distribution, the horizontal board lines can be calibrated.  
 
Fig. 4.6 Horizontal Projection 
On the basis of above description, the detailed algorithm is elaborated as follows. 
(1) Define an array (dis[10]) to record coordinate; define a array 
21 
 
(ptempdata[2][height]) to record the number of black pixels on horizontal lines 
and its corresponding coordinate. 
(2) Scan each horizontal line, count the number of black pixels, and store it and its 
corresponding coordinate in the array (ptempdata). In order to decrease the 
calculation, we can set a threshold and discard data that is less than the 
threshold. The number of data is recorded in “count”. 
(3) Sort the data in order. 
(4) Get the first coordinate dis[0] = ptempdata[0][0] (i.e., the horizontal coordinate 
with the maximum black pixels). On the base of this coordinate, the data in 
second line (ptempdata[0][1]) is compared with it. If the result is bigger than 
height/15, then it is regarded qualified; otherwise, continue to compare the 
data in third line, until we get the second coordinate dis[1]. Afterwards, we 
compare all of the data with the former one, record those that satisfy the 
condition in “dis” until 10 coordinate are found. 
(5) Sort “dis” in order to prepare for the next steps. 
 
After computing by the above steps, we can get the 10 horizontal coordinates of the 
board. During the experiment, we have process a bunch of images. In some cases, we 
cannot find 10 qualified coordinates. Therefore, when we discard useless points, we 
adopts adaptive threshold to solve the problem. 
 
After we get horizontal coordinates, a similar algorithm can be applied on detecting 
vertical coordinates. However, due to the problem of viewing angle, the image will be 
deformed to some extent. The vertical projection result of the whole image is shown 
in Figure 4.7 (a). As we can see, there exists big noise. As the coordinate of each 
vertical coordinate is different from each other, we can only do the projection 
separately. The result is shown in Figure 4.7 (b).  
       
(a) Vertical projection in whole   (b) vertical projection in part 
Fig. 4.7 Vertical projection 
Synthesizing the above two steps, the cross-corner detection strategy can be 
concluded as: 
(1) Project the image in horizontal direction to get horizontal coordinates and save 
the coordinates in hlinedis[10]; 
(2) Separate the image from top to bottom according to the results in (1). 
(3) Project the separated images in vertical direction to get the vertical coordinates 
and save the coordinates in vlinedis[9]. 
22 
 
 
Experiment results show that this method to calibrate the chess board is highly 
affected by the position of chess board relative to the position of camera.  
4.8 Other Solutions 
In addition to the methods described in preceding sections, there also exist many 
other solutions. For instance, Jose G. [16] in his robotic system adopts a method that 
requires user to click the four chessboard corners in the image. Then, chess squares 
can be calculated automatically, based on the knowledge of introduced corners. In 
Chapter 6, we will propose a more robust and efficient Chinese board calibration 
algorithm.

5 Review of Piece Recognition Methods 
Several solutions can be used to detect a chess piece. In Section 3.2 (differential 
image), we have discussed a method of inferring the type of chess piece by simply 
comparing current situation with the situation before the last move. But, this is not a 
robust and flexible method, as it has many constraints on the system. This section 
introduces more elegant algorithms based on pattern recognition [18] [19] technique. 
In order to recognize chess pieces correctly and efficiently, the key factor is how to 
represent the features that could distinguish different type of pieces, i.e. what is the 
descriptor.  
5.1 Template Matching Method 
The main idea of template matching [21] is to searching the corresponding pattern in 
an image based on a known pattern on another pre-prepared image. The aim of 
template matching is to check up whether the pattern image is existed on current 
image and to get the position of pattern image on current image. The most 
frequently used method of template matching is pattern matching. It adopts the 
gray-scale image of an object as known template and search the known pattern on 
an image. 
 
Template matching is image processing technique based on 2-d image window. For 
instance, the template T (n x n pixels) is stacked on the searching image S (w x h 
pixels) and the overlap area is called sub-image Sij. ( i, j) is the top-left coordinate of 
the sub-image on S. The searching range will be: 
           
          
The process of template matching will be done by comparing the similarity of T and 
Sij, which can be measured by following formula: 
                           
 
   
 
   
              
 
   
 
   
                     
 
   
 
   
             
 
   
 
   
 
In the formula, the first item is the energy of sub-image; the third item is the energy 
of template. They are irrelevant to template matching. The second item is the 
cross-correlation between the template and sub-image and is changed along with (i, 
24 
 
j). When matching the template with sub-image, this item has a maximum value. If 
we normalise this item, we can get correlation coefficient: 
        
                     
 
   
                 
 
              
  
   
 
   
  
When the template is completely the same with sub-image, the correlation 
coefficient R(i , j) = 1. When finishing searching on image S, we will get a maximum 
value of R (Rmax(im, jm)), then its corresponding sub-image Sim,jm is the matching result. 
Obviously, when applying this formula to do image matching, the amount of 
computation is fairly large and the speed will be low.  
 
Another formula to measure error between T and Sij is: 
                          
 
   
 
   
 
Where E(i,j) get to its minimum is the matching result. In order to increase 
computing speed, we define an error threshold E0. When E(i, j) > E0, we can stop 
calculation on that position and begin to compute in next position.  
 
The result of template matching method is proven to be efficient. However, as chess 
piece has no direction, this method has its limitation. We must put the chess pieces 
in one direction to make sure the characters on the pieces are shown up-right.  
5.2 Ring Statistics 
There are 11 different types of characters on Chinese chess piece, shown as follows. 
 
Fig. 5.1 Chinese Chess Pieces 
In real-time chess recognition system, it requires that speed of recognition must be 
high enough and those methods with complex computation are discarded. Therefore, 
we are looking for simple, fast, efficient algorithms that are specific to those 11 
distinct characters. Zhongkai Xiao in his postgraduate thesis proposed a method of 
ring statistics to recognize chess pieces. This section will describe this method in 
details. 
 
By the feature of outline border on chess pieces, we can easily segment each piece 
from the binary image by template circle matching preparing for character 
recognition. As the randomness of character orientation, the key factor to recognize 
each character is the direction. Here is the main idea of this algorithm. We first find 
the centre of a character and use this as the centre to build concentric circles, whose 
radius are R/4, R/2, 3R/4 (R is the radius of a chess piece) respectively. At the mean 
while, we count time of intersections between each circle and the character. The 
25 
 
statistical result is used as code to build the descriptor to classify each character. This 
method obtains the structure information of characters and is irrelevant to the 
orientation. The idea of this algorithm is shown as Figure 5.2.  
  
  
Fig. 5.2 Ring statistics diagram 
The flow chart of ring statistics algorithm is shown as follows. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 5.3 Ring statistics flow chart 
The first two images in Figure 5.2 represent the black pawn in Chinese chess. As we 
can see, the numbers of intersection between concentric circles and the character 
are 5, 6, and 1 respectively. Therefore, black pawn can be encoded as 561. Similarly, 
the last two images in Figure 5.2 represent black bishop in Chinese chess, and the 
numbers of intersection between concentric circles and the character are 7, 8, and 
4respectively. Therefore, black pawn can be encoded as 784. According to this rule, 
we can easily get a character code table shown as follows.

5.2.1 The Method of Counting Intersection 
To count the number of intersections between each concentric circle and the 
characters, we first get the centre (x, y), and the radius (r), and then count along the 
circle anticlockwise starting from (x, y+r). To get pixel coordinate on the circle, we can 
apply the famous Bresenham [22] circle drawing algorithm.  
5.2.2 Encoder Construction 
If the radius of the outer-boarder of the chess piece if r, we should then count the 
number of intersection between the character and circles with radius ranging from 1 
to r and we will get a result string. In order to get a minimum-length string that can 
represent tell each character, we must analysis and sift the string. The method of 
sifting is: if we delete a circle and the code of the rest of the string can distinguish 
each character, then we delete the circle; otherwise, we retrain that circle.  
 
27 
 
In this case, the result of sifting is the three circles whose radiuses are R/4, R/2 and 
3R/4 for each. Deleting of any circle will result in repetition of codes.  
5.2.3 Experiment Analysis 
The experiment result shows that this algorithm is efficient if we the light condition is 
good enough. Otherwise, pieces will be mistakenly recognized. Ideally, the code of 
horse is 762, be it will produce unexpected result in poor light condition shown as 
Figure 5.4.  
 
Fig. 5.4 binary image of “Horse” in poor light condition 
5.3 Recognition Based on Connectivity and Holes 
Another recognition algorithm of Chinese chess pieces is based on connectivity and 
amount of holes of Chinese characters. [23] The so-called connectivity of a character 
means the number of connecting areas (8-connectivity) that are contained in a 
character; the so-called amount of holes means the number of connecting areas that 
are contained in the background of a character.  
 
The problem of how to compute the number of connecting areas and holes can be 
translated into area statistics problem. We define the color of connecting areas as 0 
and the color of holes as 1. Connecting area statistics algorithm is described as 
follows. 
Algorithm Input: color - the color of connecting area; count - the counter of 
connecting area  
Algorithm Step: 
(1) Initialize: set the initial position of scanning image to (0, 0); set count = 0; 
(2) If finish scanning, then terminate; otherwise go to (3) 
(3) Scan the image of chess piece, and find a pixel (x, y) whose value equals to color 
(4) Let the pixel (x, y) be a seed pixel, make color as original pixel value and make 
1-color as new pixel value. Call the Flood-Fill Algorithm [24] to fill in the area 
where the pixel (x, y) located whose value equals to color by using pixel value 1 – 
color. 
(5) Add 1 to count; go to (2) 
The algorithm of recognizing Chinese chess pieces based on connectivity and amount 
of holes of Chinese characters is described as follows. 
(1) Count the number of connecting areas: call the connecting area statistics 
algorithm with the parameter color set to 0 to get the number of connecting 
areas of black pixels. 
28 
 
(2) Count the number of holes: call the connecting area statistics algorithm with the 
parameter color set to 1 to get the number of connecting areas of white pixels. 
(3) Build the feature code: combine the results from (1) and (2) to a string to match 
with standard identification code. 
Following table shows the identification code of each character.

Experiment result shows that this algorithm is fast and has a high reliability, but the 
feature codes are highly restricted to specific character font.  
5.4 Other Solutions 
Chinese piece recognition is a typical rotatable Chinese character recognition 
problem. The key factor to recognition is to extract the rotation invariant feature 
vectors. In addition to the algorithms that I mentioned, there are also many other 
solutions to that problem, among which, relatively mature methods are including Hu 
[25] and Zernicke [26] moment feature which are based on methods of algebraic 
invariants. Some other method firstly obtains the contour points and then adopts 
Fourier transform. All of them have been proven by experiments to be less resistant 
29 
 
to interference and less robust. Therefore, the proposed Chinese chess piece 
recognition algorithm based on projection histogram of polar coordinates spaces and 
Fourier descriptor will be elaborated in Chapter 7.

6 Proposed Board Calibration Algorithm 
In this Chapter, we will introduce our proposed Chinese board detection algorithm 
which is based on corner-line matching method. In the end of this section, an 
analysis on experiment result will be given. Also, we will give a comparison between 
corner-line matching chess board detection algorithm and previous works that have 
been done. 
 
Before we starting our topic, let’s first have a look at the pattern of Chinese chess 
board. Figure 6.1 shows a standard Chinese chess board. As we can see, a standard 
Chinese chess board consists of 9 horizontal lines and 10 vertical lines. (Although the 
vertical line is split in the middle of the board, we still regard it as a single line) Our 
corner-line matching algorithm is designed based on that information. Also, there are 
also some additional lines or features in the chess board, but in our algorithm they 
are not necessary. 
 
Fig. 6.1 Standard Chinese Chess Board 
When we apply pure line-based algorithms (introduced in Chapter 4.1) or pure 
corner-based algorithms (introduced in Chapter 4.3) to calibrate the chess board, the 
results are fairly unstable and less robust, which are easily affected by the 
environment such as light sources, background stuff, board position and shadows on 
the board. That is because, when we apply line detection algorithms such as Hough 
transform or corner detection algorithms such as Harris corner detector, the noise is 
inevitable. A bunch of “fake” lines and “fake” corners will be detected, at the mean 
while, some lines and corners that are supposed to be existed might be missing in 
the result of detection.  
 
Figure 6.2 shows the original chess board images and the results of applying Hough 
transform to detect lines in different cases.  
31 
 
 
 
 
         
         
         
Fig. 6.2 Chess Board Images and the Results of Line Detection 
Figure 6.3 show the original chess board images and the results of applying Harris 
corner detector in different cases.

32 
 
As we can see from the results, the detecting result is easily affected by environment. 
Especially in real-time environment, the result will change all the time. In order to 
build a high fault tolerance algorithm, we make use of following basic rules that are 
applicable in standard Chinese chess board: 
Rule 1: There are 9 horizontal lines in Chinese chess board. 
Rule 2: There are 10 vertical lines in Chinese chess board.  
Rule 3: Valid board corners in Chinese chess board must be intersected with at least 
two valid board lines. 
Rule 4: Valid board lines in Chinese chess board must pass through a bunch of valid 
board corners. (We set the threshold of the number of valid board corners to 4 in our 
case) 
Rule 5: The intersection angle between horizontal lines and vertical lines must be 
restricted within a threshold. (Here we set the threshold to 90 +/- 10) 
Rule 6: The intersection angle between lines in same direction (horizontal or vertical) 
must be less than a threshold. (Here we set the threshold to +/- 10) 
 
The idea of the algorithm is roughly described as follows: 
Step 1: Pre-process. 
Step 2: Detect lines by Hough Line Transform. 
Step 3: Detect corners by Harris corner detector. 
Step 4: Select “valid” board corners. (Passed by at least 2 lines) 
Step 5: Select “valid” board lines. (Come across at least 4 “valid” corners ) 
Step 6: Select four boundary lines of chess board. 
Step 7: Compute the four boundary corners by Cramer ’s rule. 
Step 8: Determine the direction of board. 
Step 9: Compute all of the inner board corners by bilinear interpolation. 
 
Each of the steps will be expounded in details in following sections. 
6.1 Algorithm Procedures 
Step 1: Pre-Process 
Before we move on to next steps, the chess board image should be processed in 
advance. Detailed steps are list as follows. 
(1) Transform the original image to gray-scaled image 
(2) Remove noise: As we adopt normal web camera, the image quality is not good 
enough and noise is obviously existed. In order to increase the detection effect, 
median filter [27] are applied to remove noise.  
(3) Resize image: For robustness purpose, this algorithm is design to fit different 
image format and size. However, if the size of image is big (e.g., the size of image 
captured from iPhone camera: 1936x2592), the speed of detecting cannot be 
tolerated. That is mainly because the computing time of Hough transform to 
detect lines will increase dramatically along with the increase of image size. 
33 
 
Therefore, we resize the image to 500 by 500 pixels and in the final stage, when 
we finish calibrating board, the detecting result will be restored to fit the original 
image.  
(4) Edge extraction: As Hough transform works on binary image, so before doing line 
detection we should extract edges from image and change it into binary image. 
There exist many mature edge extraction algorithms including Canny operator, 
Sobel operator, Laplace operator, Robert operator. After comparison of 
experiment results, Canny operator performs the best in our case.  
 
Figure 6.4 shows the original image and the result of edge extraction.  
 
    a. Original image          b. result of edge extraction 
Fig. 6.4 Edge Extraction Result 
Step 2: Line Detection 
As for line detection, we adopt the method of Hough Line Transform. [10] The result 
of Line detection is shown in following figure (the detected lines are plot in black 
color).  
 
Fig. 6.5 Result of Using Hough Transform to Detect Lines 
34 
 
Step 3: Corner Detection 
To detect corners on the chess board image, we adopt Harris corner detector. Harris 
corner detection method compares a small number of surrounding pixels with its 
immediate neighbor to check if current pixel is a corner. The result of corner 
detection is shown in following figure (the detected corners are plot in black color).  
 
Fig. 6.6 Result of Using Harris Corner Detector to Detect Corners 
Step 4: Select “Valid” Board Corners 
As we can see from the result of Step 3, when we apply Harris corner detector, a 
bunch of corners will be detected including “invalid” corners which is actually not 
board corners. In this step, we will select “valid” board corners from the bunch of 
corners.  
 
According to Rule 3, valid board corners in Chinese chess board must be intersected 
with at least two valid board lines. Based on that rule, we can eliminate a lot of 
useless corners. This Step is a prelude that serves for next Step.  
 
The result of selecting “valid” board corners is shown on following figure, where the 
blue “*” marks represent the selecting result. As you can see, there are also some 
“fake” board corners selected. Therefore, it is not enough so for to calibrate the 
chess board.  
35 
 
 
Fig. 6.7 Result of Selecting “Valid” Board Corners 
 
Step 5: Select “Valid” Board Lines 
 “Valid” board lines selection can be done based on the result of step 4. According to 
Rule 4, valid board lines in Chinese chess board must pass through a bunch of valid 
board corners. In our case, we set the threshold of the number of valid board corners 
that a valid board line must come across to 4.  
 
However, that is not enough. As we can see in Figure 6.1, on standard Chinese chess 
board, there exist four diagonal lines, which are also meet Rule 4. But, obviously 
these lines are not we want. In order to eliminate the diagonal lines, we introduce 
Rule 5 (the intersection angle between horizontal lines and vertical lines must be 
restricted within a threshold) and Rule 6 (The intersection angle between lines in 
same direction (horizontal or vertical) must be less than a threshold).  
 
The procedure of selecting valid board lines is list as follows. 
(1) Use histogram to statistic the distribution of angles of lines detected on the chess 
board image. 
(2) Get two peaks (ave1, ave2) from the histogram in Step (1), and make sure their 
degree of intersection angle is bigger than a threshold. They represent angles of 
most lines, i.e., the average degree of horizontal lines and average degree of 
vertical lines. 
(3) Traverse all of the lines. If they satisfy: (a) the difference between its degree of 
angles and ave1 or ave2 is less than 10 degree; (b) the number of valid board 
36 
 
corners on the lines are bigger than 4, then those lines are regarded as valid 
board lines. 
  
The result of selecting “valid” board lines is shown on following figure, where the 
green lines represent the selecting result.  
 
Fig. 6.8 Result of Selecting “Valid” Board Lines 
Step 6: Select Four Chess Board Boundary Lines 
Simply knowing valid board lines is not enough. That is because we cannot guarantee 
each of the board lines is detected or no redundant lines are detected. In order to 
enhance robustness, we must do further processing. The purpose of this Step is to 
select four chess board boundary lines.  
 
To get the four boundary lines, firstly, we classify the valid board lines into two 
groups: the group of vertical lines and the group of horizontal lines. In the first group, 
we select the left most line and the right most line. In the second group, we select 
the upper most line and the line in the bottom. Those lines are chess board boundary 
lines.  
 
The result of boundary lines is shown on following figure, they are drew in red, blue, 
yellow, green colour respectively in thick line. 
37 
 
 
Fig. 6.9 Result of Selecting Boundary Lines 
Step 7: Compute Four Boundary Corners  
Boundary corners are the points of intersection between boundary lines pair wise, 
which can be get easily according to Cramer’s rule [28]. Boundary corners are shown 
on following figure, they are drew in red, blue, yellow, green colour respectively in 
rectangle mark. 
 
Fig. 6.10 Result of Selecting Boundary Corners 
38 
 
Step 8: Determine Board Direction  
Unlike western chess, in Chinese chess, the number of horizontal board lines and 
vertical board lines are different. So far, we have got four boundary corners. In order 
to do further calibrate we must know the direction of current board, i.e., which 
direction of the board is occupied by 10 board lines and which direction of the board 
is occupied by 9 board lines.  
 
The main idea is to build inter board lines by interpolation in both direction, then 
compute the distance error between interpolated board lines and detected board 
lines for each direction. The direction with smaller error is the correct answer. The 
algorithm of determining the board direction is list as follows.  
 
(1) Put the boundary corners anticlockwise, and define as “corner1”, “corner2”, 
“corner3”, and “corner4”. 
(2) Assume the board line “corner1->corner4” or “corner2->corner3” is “horizontal” 
line, i.e., it is intersected with 10 board lines. While the board 
line”corner1->corner2” or “corner4-> corner3” is “vertical” line.  
(3) Set error1 to 0; set counter to 0. 
(4) Build 8 “vertical” inner board lines, whose “theta” is close to ave1 (see Step 5). 
(5) For current_line = each “vertical” inner board lines 
     Traverse each valid board lines (see Step 5); 
If there is a valid board lines that has a similar theta as current_line and is 
close to current_line;  
Then, calculate the distance between the two lines and save as dis; let 
error1 = error1 + dis; let counter = counter + 1; 
 End 
(6) Build 7 “horizontal” inner board lines, whose “theta” is close to ave2 (see Step 5). 
(7) For current_line = each “horizontal” inner board lines 
     Traverse each valid board lines (see Step 5); 
If there is a valid board lines that has a similar theta as current_line and is 
close to current_line;  
Then, calculate the distance between the two lines and save as dis; let 
error1 = error1 + dis; let counter = counter + 1; 
 End 
(8) Let error1 = error1 / counter; 
(9) Assume the board line “corner1->corner2” or “corner4->corner3” is “horizontal” 
line, i.e., it is intersected with 10 board lines. While the board 
line”corner1->corner4” or “corner2-> corner3” is “vertical” line.  
(10) Set error2 to 0; set counter to 0. 
(11) Build 8 “vertical” inner board lines, whose “theta” is close to ave1 (see Step 5). 
(12) For current_line = each “vertical” inner board lines 
     Traverse each valid board lines (see Step 5);

If there is a valid board lines that has a similar theta as current_line and is 
close to current_line;  
Then, calculate the distance between the two lines and save as dis; let 
error2 = error2 + dis; let counter = counter + 1; 
 End 
(13) Build 7 “horizontal” inner board lines, whose “theta” is close to ave2 (see Step 
5). 
(14) For current_line = each “horizontal” inner board lines 
     Traverse each valid board lines (see Step 5);

error2 = error2 + dis; let counter = counter + 1; 
 End 
(15) Let error2 = error2 / counter; 
(16) Compare error1 and error2. 
If error1 is bigger than error2 
Then  
Let bc1 = corner1; 
  Let bc2 = corner2; 
  Let bc3 = corner3; 
  Let bc4 = corner4; 
 Else 
Let bc1 = corner2; 
  Let bc2 = corner3; 
  Let bc3 = corner4; 
  Let bc4 = corner1; 
 End 
(17) Finally, we get the four variables bc1, bc2, bc3, and bc4. They are sort in 
anticlockwise order, and the board line “bc1->bc4” or “bc2->bc3” is “horizontal” 
line, i.e., it is intersected with 10 board lines. While the board line”bc1->bc2” or 
“bc4-> bc3” is “vertical” line. 
The corresponding positions of bc1, bc2, bc3, and bc4 in Chinese chess board are 
illustrated in following figure.

Step 9: Calculate Inner Board Corners  
So far, we have got the four chess board boundary corners and the board direction. 
The final step to calibrate Chinese chess board is to get the positions of all other 
inner board corners.  
 
Inner board corners can be computed by interpolating four boundary corners. Here 
we apply bilinear interpolation method. [29] Following code implement this step. 
X = zeros(9, 10); 
Y = zeros(9, 10); 
for m = 1:9 
    for n = 1:10 
        x1 = ((n-1)*bc4(1) + (10-n)*bc1(1)) / 9; 
        y1 = ((n-1)*bc4(2) + (10-n)*bc1(2)) / 9; 
        x2 = ((n-1)*bc3(1) + (10-n)*bc2(1)) / 9; 
        y2 = ((n-1)*bc3(2) + (10-n)*bc2(2)) / 9; 
         
        X(m, n) = ((m-1)*x2 + (9-m)*x1) / 8; 
        Y(m, n) = ((m-1)*y2 + (9-m)*y1) / 8; 
    end 
end 
 
The result of board calibration is shown on following figure, the board corners are 
drew as cyan circles and magenta circles on each side.

6.2 Result Analysis 
Experiments have been taken to use the proposed algorithm to detect Chinese chess 
board under different viewing angles, different backgrounds, and different light 
conditions. Following figures show the result in typical scenarios.  
6.2.1 Different Viewing Angles 
First, let’s look at board calibration results in different viewing angles.  
  
  
  
Fig. 6.13 Board Calibrate in Different Viewing Angles 
As we can see from the first two images, chess board is successfully calibrated in top 
view with different rotation angle with different rotation angles, which indicates the 
proposed algorithm work well in top view and different rotation angles of chess 
board. The remaining figures indicate that with the viewing angle become lower and 
lower the result will be worse. It is worth noticing that the third image shows us the 
calibration result in perspective view. Although, the chess board is successfully 
calibrated, however, if looking carefully, we can found the inner board corners are 
not overlapping exactly with real board corners. That is caused by a defect of the 
proposed algorithm. As in the proposed algorithm, inner board corners are 
42 
 
calculated by bilinear interpolation of the four boundary corners. While in 
perspective view, the distribution of board lines is not linear any more. Following 
figures provide a good illustration of this. 
 
a. Linear             b. Perspective 
Fig. 6.14 Deformation Caused by Perspective View 
6.2.2 Different Background 
Now, let’s look at the results affected by different background. 
  
  
  
Fig. 6.15 Board Calibration Affected by Different Background 
43 
 
Image 1 and image 2 shows chess board in different background, both of them are 
successfully calibrated. Image 3 and image 4 shows chess board that is covered by 
objects. Both of them are successfully calibrated. Image 5 and image 6 shows the 
results of board calibration affected by surrounding objects. One of them fails in 
detection.  
 
We can easily conclude that the algorithm is highly resistant to backgrounds, 
surrounding objects, or even object covered partially on the board.  
6.2.3 Different Light Conditions 
Here we show some experimental result under different light conditions. 
  
  
  
Fig. 6.16 Board Calibration Affected by Different Light Conditions 
As can be seen, the first four images show the experiments under different intensity 
of light sources. The last fourth image in dark light condition failed the test. Last two 
images show the experiments under effect of non-uniform illumination. One of them 
failed the test.  
 
44 
 
The results of experiment indicate that the algorithm will be affected if the intensity 
of light source is quite low or the illumination is extremely non-uniform. However, 
the overall performance of the algorithm shows good robustness under the influence 
of different light conditions.  
6.2.4 Conclusion 
In conclusion, the proposed Chinese chess board calibration algorithm performance 
well in top view, is not affected by board rotation, shows great resistance to 
background and interference, and has a good robustness under the influence of 
different light conditions. However, the performance will decrease with the viewing 
angle become lower. Also, in some extremely condition of illumination, chess board 
will be mistakenly detected.

7 Proposed Piece Recognition Algorithm 
The key problems of Chinese piece recognition are the extraction of pieces and the 
recognition of piece characters.  
 
As for piece extraction, the author in [23] adopts a binarization method based on the 
difference threshold of neighbor pixels’ gray-level. The papers in [30] [31] block the 
image base on the prior knowledge of Chinese chess board, use adaptive threshold 
method to binarise sub-images and use Hough transform to detect circles, and then 
extract the pieces. The method of using prior knowledge of chess board to extract 
chess pieces can only handle cases where the chess board must display with no 
rotation, no tilt and the position of pieces must be fixed precisely. The method of 
using threshold to binarise image requires that the color of chess pieces must differ 
greatly from the color of chess board. Also, it has a high requirement against 
illumination. Those methods can only deal with chess board in restricted condition 
and are lack of universality.  
 
As for piece character recognition, methods including template matching, ring 
statistics and method based on connectivity and holes are introduced in Chapter 5. 
All of these methods are lack of robustness. In cases when reflection happens on the 
character or the camera is out of focus, then character strokes on binarization image 
might have holes, deform or adhere to each other. If these happen, all of the feature 
that those methods adopt will be invalid. Some other solutions are based of rotation 
invariant feature vectors. Some mature solutions to that problem include Hu [25] and 
Zernicke [26] moment feature which are based on methods of algebraic invariants. 
Some methods firstly obtain the contour points and then adopt Fourier transform. All 
of them have been proven to be less resistant to interference and less robust. 
Therefore, in this Chapter, we propose a new Chinese piece recognition algorithm 
based on projection histogram of polar coordinates spaces and Fourier descriptor.  
 
Here is the basic idea. Firstly, we adopt Canny operator to extract the edge of the 
image, and morphological methods are applied to do some pre-process. Then, we 
use Hough circle transform to detect circles on the board so that chess pieces can be 
segmented to do further recognition. As for the feature extraction of pieces, we first 
convert the character image to polar coordinates space, and then build the 
projection histogram. Finally, Fourier transform is applied to solve the shift 
invariance.  
 
Algorithm procedures are expounded in details in following sections.  
46 
 
7.1 Algorithm Procedures 
Step 1: Piece Extraction 
Before we could do recognition on chess pieces, we must segment the chess piece 
from the chess board. The segmentation steps are list as follows. 
(1) Convert the original image to gray-scaled image 
(2) Remove noise  
As we adopt normal web camera, the image quality is not good enough and noise 
is obviously existed. In order to increase the algorithm performance, median 
filter [27] are applied to remove noise.  
(3) Resize image  
For robustness purpose, this algorithm is design to fit different image format and 
size. However, if the size of image is big (e.g., the size of image captured from 
iPhone camera: 1936x2592), the speed of algorithm cannot be tolerated. That is 
mainly because the computing time of Hough circle transform will increase 
dramatically along with the increase of image size. Therefore, we resize the image 
to 500 by 500 pixels and in the final stage, when we finish extracting chess pieces, 
the segmentation result will be restored to its original size.  
(4) Edge extraction 
As Hough transform works on binary image, so before doing circle detection we 
should extract edges from image and change it into binary image. There exist 
many mature edge extraction algorithms including Canny operator, Sobel 
operator, Laplace operator, Robert operator. After comparison of experiment 
results, Canny operator performs the best in our case. Edge extraction result is 
shown in following figure. 
 
a. Original Image            b. Result of Edge Extraction 
Fig. 7.1 Edge Extraction Result 
 
(5) Dilate 
In order to increase the performance of circle detection, we need to use 
morphological algorithm [32] [33] to do pre-processing. Here we adopt dilate 
operation. The kernel of dilate operation we adopt is:  
47 
 
 
     
     
     
  
The result of dilate operation is shown as follows. 
 
Fig. 7.2 Result of Dilate Operation 
(6) Circle Detection 
As for circle detection, we adopt the method of Hough Circle Transform. [10] The 
result of Hough Circle Transform is shown in following figure (the detected circles 
are drawn in red color).  
 
Fig. 7.3 Result of Hough Circle Transform 
It is noticeable that, Hough Circle Transform method will detect a bunch of 
circles and some of them are “invalid”. In order to eliminate the invalid circles on 
the board, we choose the circles that are closest to their corresponding position 
of board corners (see Chapter 6). However, there are also some mistakenly 
detected circles have no corresponding pieces. We reject those circles by 
comparing the similarity of corresponding sub-image of foreground and 
background. If their similarity is less than a threshold, we can judge they are 
invalid circles and should be rejected. Following figure shows the result of circle 
detection. (The detected circles are drawn in red color)   
48 
 
 
Fig. 7.4 Result of Circle Detection 
(7) Piece Segmentation 
After detection of circles, we can easily segment the corresponding chess pieces 
according to the position of the circles. Following figures show the segmentation 
result.  
 
          
         
         
     
Fig. 7.5 Result of Piece Segmentation 
49 
 
Step 2: Binarization 
Piece images that are segmented from chess board should be processed and 
binarized, so as to extract the feature of each piece character. We first convert the 
original image to gray-scale image. Then image is binarized by using Otsu’s method 
[34] to get global image threshold. (Figure 7.6 (b) shows the result)To remove noise, 
median filter is also applied. Given that the pixels will be sparse when we convert the 
image from Cartesian coordinate space to polar coordinates space (we will talk in 
next section), it is necessary to apply morphological dilate operation to make the 
binarized character looks thicker. (Figure 7.6 (c) shows the result) 
                              
a. Original Image      b. Binarized Image     c. After Dilate Operation 
Fig. 7.6 Piece Image Binarization 
Step 3: Convert to Polar Coordinates Space 
The rotation transformation of image in Cartesian coordinate space corresponds to 
the translation transformation in polar coordinates space. The relation between the 
two coordinate spaces is indicated by formulas 7.1. 
 
                                       
                 
             
Before doing the conversion of coordinates, the center of the character should be 
found. We get the center point by doing statistics on position of each black pixel on 
the binarized image. Then we use the center as origin of Cartesian coordinate and 
convert the image to polar coordinate space. Following figures illustrate some 
examples (pawn) of the conversion.  
                        
                        
                        
a. Original Image   b. Cartesian coordinate       c. Polar Coordinate Space 
Fig. 7.7 Convert Image from Cartesian Coordinates to Polar Coordinates 
50 
 
The projection histogram of the two axes in polar coordinate space equals to the 
projection histogram of the radial direction and tangential direction in Cartesian 
coordinate space.  
Step 4: Projection Histogram 
Projection histogram of the two axes in Cartesian coordinate space has been 
regarded as a mature technique, which has been applied on detecting and 
recognizing texts and is used to segment paragraphs, text lines and characters. 
Although this statistic feature has a high fault tolerance, it is very sensitive to the tilt 
of character. Also this statistic method lost lots of the spatial structure information 
and has poor representational ability of character features. However, in polar 
coordinate space, the spatial structure of a character has been unfolded in its 
tangential direction. By this way, the projection histogram of the image in polar 
coordinate space can keep the most information of character structures.  
 
The formulas of projection histogram are: 
 
 
 
 
               
 
              
 
                 
As       have a poor representational ability, our proposed solution adopts       
to do character recognition. Following figures show the result of “pawn” in Chinese 
chess with different rotation angles.  
Table 7.1 
Character Projection Histogram 
 
 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 5: Fourier Descriptor 
In last Step, we have successfully transferred the problem of rotate invariance of the 
characters to the problem of shift invariance. In this Step, we are going the extract 
Fourier descriptor [35] [36] to solve the shift invariance.  
 
Fourier Transform is one of methods to analysis the signal in its frequency domain. 
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [37] is an efficient method to deal with discrete Fourier 
transform (DFT) [38].  
 
The expression of discrete Fourier transform is:  
       
 
    
 
  
   
   
              
There are many forms of fast Fourier transform. The most frequently used algorithm 
is Cooley-Tukey FFT [39], it recursively divides DFT into odd part and even part, until 
each part of DFT has only two items. The expressional forms are: 
52 
 
         
 
   
 
     
 
 
  
   
        
 
   
 
       
 
 
  
   
       
 
   
 
  
   
   
    
   
 
        
 
   
 
  
   
   
   
    
 
   
 
               
      
 
   
 
                     
                  
Signal shift in time domain corresponds to the rotation in frequency domain, where 
only phase-frequency can be changed the amplitude-frequency will not be affected. 
Then expressional formulas are: 
 
         
             
     
                
Therefore, as for the vertical projection of polar coordinate      , to make it shift 
invariance, we should apply Fourier transform to it, and finally get the rotate 
invariance feature vector (V) of the piece character. 
                               
As most of the information converge at the front part and end part of the result of 
Fourier transform, so we only clip the front part and the end part to act as our 
descriptor. Following table shows the Fourier descriptor of “pawn” in Chinese chess 
with different rotation angles.  
Table 7.2 
Character Fourier Descriptor 
 
 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
The result indicates that the Fourier descriptors of the character “Pawn” in different 
angle of rotation are almost the same, which embody the rotation invariance of 
Fourier descriptor.  
 
In following table, we list the Fourier descriptor of each piece characters.

Step 6: Classification 
In standard Chinese chess, there are 14 distinct piece types. As relatively low number 
of training images of chess pieces can be obtained. We choose to adopt Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) classifier [40] [41], which work well even with low number of 
training samples.  
 
In our system, we use the Gaussian radial base function as a kernel for transforming 
the samples.  
                      
 
                      
The variable   determines the width of the radial function. If the value of   is large, 
then the radial function will be narrow which is too specific and usually result in 
more false negative classifications than false positives. Otherwise, if the value of   is 
small, the radial function will be wide, which is not specific enough and may produce 
more false positives.  
 
In addition, the weight coefficient w and offset b should satisfy following constraints: 
    
                                              
The variable   is the penalty for misclassification. The optimal weight coefficients 
minimize the criterion function: 
      
 
 
        
 
                                         
55 
 
The C parameter represent the penalty for misclassification of each sample, which is 
crucial for avoiding the over fitting of the classifier on the training samples.  
7.2 Result Analysis 
To test the recognition accuracy and performance of proposed algorithm, we take 16 
sets of samples. The results are analyzed by using the confusion matrix [42] (Table 
7.4).

8 The Software 
This Chapter provides a brief introduction to the system software.  
 
Fig. 8.1 System Software GUI 
Figure 8.1 shows the GUI of the system software. Before we start running the 
program, we can select the camera device and choose the format of video output, 
and then press the “Turn On” button.  
 
As can be seen from the user interface, the software can be divided into three 
modules according to its functionality: “Train”, “Recognition” and “Take Samples”.  
 
Module 1 provides the function of training. User can input the directory where the 
training sets locate and the number of training sets then presses the button “Train” 
to start training. After finish training, a prompt will be shown in green color saying 
“Finish training”. Also, you can press the button “Retrain” to re-train the recognition 
system.  
 
Module 2 provides the function of detecting the Chinese chess board and recognizing 
chess pieces in real-time, which can be stop or resumed in any time. 
 
Module 3 provides the function of taking piece samples that can be used to train the 
recognition system. To take samples, user should input the target directory and put 
the chess pieces on the right position of the board according to their initial position. 
58 
 
Then, press the button “Take Sample”, the system will automatically take image 
sample of each piece according to where the piece locates.

9 Evaluation 
The objectives of this project include: 
(1) correctly calibrate the chess board 
(2) automatically recognize the identity of each chess piece on chess board 
(3) display the state of chess board in real-time 
 
As for the first objective, the proposed corner-line matching algorithm can effectively 
achieve the goal. The experiment result shows that the proposed Chinese chess 
board calibration algorithm performance well in top view, is not affected by board 
rotation, shows great resistance to background and interference, and has a good 
robustness under the influence of different light conditions. However, the 
performance will decrease gradually with the viewing angle become lower. Also, in 
some extremely condition of illumination, chess board will be mistakenly detected. 
Comparing with other solutions mentioned in Chapter 4, the proposed algorithm 
shows the best robustness, flexibility, anti-interference capability, and success rate in 
top view. However, in perspective view with low angle, it might not perform as good 
as some other solutions.  
 
In addition to the success of the first objective of this project, the second objective: 
automatically recognize the identity of each chess piece on the chess board has also 
been completed. Comparing with the solutions mentioned in Chapter 5, the 
proposed algorithm is more robust and elegant, which needs fewer training samples 
but achieves better effect. Also, the proposed algorithm has no requirement and less 
constraints on specific chess set. The algorithm solves the problem of the rotate 
invariance of piece characters effectively; therefore unlike the template matching 
method, the algorithm has no limitation on how to put the chess pieces. In addition, 
unlike some other methods, no prior knowledge of the chess rules is used by the 
proposed algorithm, so there are no assumptions on how and where particular chess 
pieces are allowed to move and the initial configuration of pieces on chess board is 
not necessary to be provided in advance.  
 
With regard to the third objective, the software provides the function to track the 
state of board, reconstruct and display on user interface in real-time. Given that most 
western people can read Chinese characters, our system displays the result in 
symbolic images instead of Chinese characters.

10 Conclusion and Future Work 
This project studies and implements the vision system of chess-playing robot. In the 
project, we have proposed corner-line matching algorithm to calibrate the chess 
board and proposed a new Chinese chess piece recognition algorithm based on 
projection histogram in polar coordinates space and Fourier descriptor to recognize 
chess pieces, which is proven to be effective. Future work can be focused on how to 
increase the accuracy of piece character recognition. Also, based on our research, 
Chinese chess-playing robot or some other intelligent system can be developed.
