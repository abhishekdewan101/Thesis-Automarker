Abstract 
Background: In the last decade studies have reported an increasing number of proteins that 
lack a tertiary structure. These proteins have been defined as intrinsically disordered proteins 
(IDPs) which maintain important functions like signalling and regulation, which are 
complementary to the functions of proteins of known structure. The current challenges that 
the bioinformatics field faces revolve around the understanding of the fundamental principles 
that govern IDPs, how they contribute to the functioning of living organisms and how their 
physic-chemical principles can be utilized in adjacent fields like drug discovery or 
biotechnology. The topic of intrinsic disorder is particularly interesting since numerous 
human diseases have been linked to IDPs. In this thesis we focus on the disease-disorder 
relationship and assume that mutations within intrinsic disorder can cause disease. 
Distinguishing between pathogenic and functionally neutral point mutations has been in the 
limelight of bioinformatics and it is increasingly being exploited. The originality in this thesis 
is that we are focusing on the mutations within disordered regions in a systematic way that is 
easy to follow for researchers and paves the way for further research into this area (i.e. 
incorporation within a larger mutation predictor for structured proteins). 
Results: We use the nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNP) found in the 
SwissVar portal and correct the dataset to only include human diseases. We first identify 
which mutations fall within intrinsic disorder via a well-known disorder predictor IUPred. 
Once the data is pre-processed we design two classifiers: one based on the difference of 
empirical probability density functions; and the second one based on the average of the class 
labels (in our case the label identifies if the mutation is disease/non-disease causing). In order 
to better classify new data, the scoring functions were estimated in three ways, first by linear 
interpolation, second by fitting splines and third by fitting weighted splines. The results were 
in line with our hypothesis (some mutations within disorder are deleterious) and showed that 
based solely on disorder scores, our classifiers can roughly fit the data (area under the ROC 
curve equal to 65%).  
Conclusions: We conclude that there is a significant link between disease and mutations 
within intrinsic disorder. The classical scoring functions with few degrees of freedom were 
not enough to capture the complex interactions between the variables so we successfully fitted 
spline surfaces which were more flexible. From a biological point of view this finding leads to 
further research questions that might help shed light on the current human diseases without 
efficient treatment.

1 Introduction 
1.1 Motivation 
Proteins are very important molecules that perform vital functions within cells. Up until 
around a decade ago it was believed that protein sequence follows structure which follows 
function. Nevertheless, scientists found a large number of proteins that lacked a stable 
structure and still maintained vital functions within the cell. With time, the structure-function 
paradigm has been shaken up and academia now accepts the existence of intrinsically 
disordered proteins that have well defined functions which are complementary to those of 
structured proteins, yet are devoid of a stable tertiary structure. What makes these disordered 
proteins so special is the fact that they have been linked to a number of serious human 
diseases. A growing body of researchers have dedicated time in trying to tackle the challenges 
intrinsic disorder brings to the table.  In this thesis we wish to improve the knowledge on 
missense mutations, but this time in disordered proteins. These sorts of point mutations appear 
to be more prevalent than first expected, thus understanding their effects and functional 
impact on IDPs is a new question that has yet to be broached.  
1.2 Research questions and hypothesis 
This thesis has a strong research orientation and endeavours to answer a series of questions 
concerning our topic. The main questions that we are addressing are: 
? How common are point mutations within IDPs and what functional impact do they 
have? 
? Are disease-causing mutations more prone to fall within ordered or disordered protein 
regions? 
? Is deterioration of an IDPÕs function, to the point of becoming disease prone because 
of missense mutations or due to other processes like posttranslational modifications 
(PTM)? 
The hypothesis that we base our research questions on is that point mutations found within 
intrinsically disordered proteins/regions have a higher propensity of being disease causing. 
With this in mind we envisage a mutation classifier that will determine whether there is a link 
between mutations within disorder and disease. It may not be the best performing classifier, 
but as long as it proves the link then we are satisfied as, in essence, that is what we are 
researching.  
In order to answer these research questions we are going to first determine the correct data 
needed, adapt it for our research project and then conduct an analysis that will shed light on 
the aforementioned questions. 
1.3 Aims and objectives 
The link between disease and mutations within disordered regions has yet to be (dis)proven 
via an extensive analysis. The only articles that have inquisited  into the matter are (Vacic & 
Iakoucheva 2012) and  (Hu et al. 2011).  The first authors acknowledged the idea that disease 
2 
mutations within IDPs may have a higher impact than first envisaged. They base their 
arguments on observations extracted from simple statistics extracted from the analyzed 
dataset (from the UniProtKB/SwissProt database) that highlight the level of disorder within 
the data. The authors observe that there are considerable more cases of disorder to order 
transitions within the mutated protein sequences caused by missense point mutations than the 
other way around. This led to the formalization of a ranking of the amino acid substitutions 
that are involved in these sorts of transitions. Their analysis stops there and they advocate for 
further, more thorough research to be done, suggesting to also look at other type of mutations 
in conjunction with missense mutations.  
The latter authors have a different approach and start their hypothesis that the single 
nucleotide variants (SNVs) that cause disorder to order transitions are deleterious. Compared 
to the previous study, these authors focus on single nucleotide variants rather than single 
nucleotide polymorphisms. The first types of mutations are aberrations that occur only in one 
individual in a given population while the second type is a mutation that occurs in the same 
locus for all members of a given species. Thus, from the beginning we are dealing with a 
different set of data. Moreover, the authors use simulated data from the 1000 Genome Project. 
The authors work with the data at a gene level and construct a function that will measure the 
change in disorder prediction caused by the mutation. This research also proved to be unable 
to answer a generalized question concerning disease causing mutations within intrinsic 
disorder. 
Lastly, the extensive research that has been done into mapping SNPs to a particular disorder 
based on complex classifiers cannot be utilized on intrinsic disorder since the fundamental 
feature of protein structure cannot be utilized with intrinsic disorder. Moreover, the amino 
acid charges and chemical attributes of intrinsically disordered proteins are vastly different 
from those of structured proteins, making it impossible for researchers to correctly assess the 
impact mutations that fall in these regions can have.  
Based on these short falls we have investigated a more generalized approach to disease and 
mutations within disorder. The aims of the work were therefore to: 
? Explore the link between disease and mutations within intrinsic disorder based on an 
in-depth statistical analysis. 
? Present the results in a classifier form in order to dismiss or accept the working 
hypothesis. 
 
The above mentioned aims follow the next set of objectives: 
1. Literature review: Further study the advancements made within the bioinformatics 
field on intrinsically disordered proteins. Assess the best performing disorder 
predictors based on the task at hand and highlight the differences between the existing 
mutation predictors and what a mutation within disorder must incorporate. 
2. Statistical analysis: Analyze the best statistical approach of identifying relationships 
between variables given the constraints of our dataset.  
3. Evaluate the one-feature classifier: evaluate the classifier based on the novel 
information it puts forward. Concentrating on accuracy and efficiency levels of the 
classifier are not the main targets of this research since the data information used is 
scarce and the one feature analysis is not strong enough to build a standalone 
3 
classifier. The key goal here is to establish the strength of the link between disease and 
mutations within intrinsic disorder at a generalized level.  
4. Discussion for further research: Determine further theoretical and implementation 
avenues that could strengthen (or dismiss) the hypothesis based on incorporating more 
biological related information. 
1.4 Organization 
As mentioned earlier, this thesis is of investigative type. In general terms, the paper has three 
main areas: the first is an extensive background comprising the first 6 chapters on intrinsically 
disordered proteins, point mutations, disorder and SNP predictors as well as a short overview 
of the limited research done in our area of interest. The second part of the thesis comprises the 
7
th
 and 8
th
 chapter where the data pre-processing techniques are presented and a 
comprehensive statistical analysis of the data is explained. The last main part of the thesis 
comprises chapters 9 and 10 which present and discuss the results while the latter chapter 
gives a critical evaluation of the work performed and the achievements of this thesis. Lastly, 
an insight into the further research that can be done given a larger time frame will be 
discussed. The thesis will conclude with a summary of what we have achieved.

2 Intro to Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) 
This background chapter will provide the necessary information concerning structured 
proteins versus intrinsically disordered proteins that is needed for understanding the work and 
scope of this thesis. The following section 2.1 will describe what structured proteins are, 
whilst 2.2 will focus on disordered proteins in terms of the definition, classification, function 
and occurrence. Section 2.3 will highlight the link academia has associated between 
disordered proteins and human disease.  
2.1 Proteins and protein structures 
Proteins are macromolecules that have a pivotal role in the structure and functioning of living 
cells; they represent the basis of life. Humans have identified their importance from the 
beginning of modern civilization, thus the etymology of the word protein from the Greek 
ÒprotosÓ which means first. Proteins are involved in a variety of activities throughout the 
organism; here we mention transport of oxygen, regulation of cellular functioning, but also 
gene replication.  
Depending on their molecular structure, proteins can be categorized into fibruous, globular 
and conjugated proteins. However, according to their function, proteins can be categorized in 
antibodies, enzymes, messengers or proteins that act as structural components or transporters.  
A proteinÕs structure and function are heavily correlated as function is derived from the 
molecular structure. The structural organization of a protein spans over 4 levels. The primary 
structure is the linear sequence of amino acids (or residues) that constitute the protein. The 
secondary structure is defined by the hydrogen bonds within the peptide backbone which can 
form helixes or sheets. The tertiary structure represents the more complex level of folding 
observed within the secondary structure. Lastly, the quaternary structure is a combination of 
two or more amino acid chains that will form a full unit. Figure 2.1 offers a graphical 
representation of all four levels of protein structure.

As mentioned earlier, the function of a protein is discovered based on its 3D structure. 
Nevertheless, this paradigm has proven not to stand in the case of intrinsically disordered 
proteins which lack a tertiary structure, and yet perform vital functions within the cellular 
machinery. The following section will further develop this paradox. 
2.2 Intrinsically disordered proteins 
The past decade has led to the discovery that proteins in cells do not always display a unique 
tertiary structure when isolated, yet still maintain a specific function under physiological 
conditions. This discovery was only possible because of advancements in X-ray 
crystallograpy, NMR spectroscopy and hydrodinamics (Serdyuk 2007). This discovery raised 
a series of questions, among which why does a cell need intrinsically disordered proteins; 
what proportion of such proteins is out there or what determines the intrinsic disorder? The 
aim of this section is to provide a general definition and classification of these sort of proteins, 
describe the functions these proteins possess and determine thir occurence in nature. 
2.2.1 Definition and classification 
After the decoding of the human genome, it was discovered that intrinsically disordered 
proteins (IDP) are actually highly abundant in nature, with a higher rate in eukaryotes than 
prokaryotes.  This sort of proteins lack a stable tertiary structure yet still maintain a proper 
function, jeopardizing the paradigm that structure follows function. The idea that a unique 
tertiary structure is needed for function dates back from over 100 years ago when Emil 
Fischer discovered that molecules follow a key and lock pattern while conducting 
experiments on brewerÕs yeast extract (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). 40 years later, Mirsky and 
Pauling advanced the idea that the function of an enzyme is directly related to its unique 
configuration. After the development of macromolecular crystallograpy in the late 1950s it 
has become apparent that not all proteins fold to a stable tertiary structure making it evident 
that disorder is a recurring theme within a proteinÕs structure (Serdyuk 2007). Currently, the 
scientific field is concentrating on correctly identifying these macromolecules; a commonly 
accepted definition of intrinsically disordered proteins is that they are proteins that lack both a 
hydrophobic core and a secondary and/or tertiary structure making them highly flexible and 
soluble (Orosz & Ov‡di 2011).  Moreover, in terms of amino acid sequences, IDPs differ 
immensely from folded or structured proteins. For instance, IDPs mostly lack bulky 
hydrophobic and aromatic residues responsible for stabilizing the hydrophobic core of a 
structured protein; but, on the other hand, are abundant in polar and structure breaking 
residues (Uversky et al. 2008). These are the main attributes that existing classifiers use in 
order to determine whether a protein is disordered or not. As for classification, intrinsic 
disorder can be categorized either as collapsed (in the form of molten globules) or as extended 
(in the form of coils or pre-molten globules) (Uversky et al. 2008). 
2.2.2 Function 
Collectively, the scientific field accepts that IDPs have a complementary role to that of 
structured proteins. Among the most important functions we mention regulatory functions 
related to molecular recognitions and signal transduction (Uversky et al. 2009). Previous 
research (Biology & Uversky 2011) has shown that IDPs are functionally extremely different 
6 
from structured proteins as the sample the researchers used almost did not contain enzymes 
and yet performed vital cellular roles.  More precisely, the specific functions that these 
proteins perform can be classified into four groups: (a) molecular recognition, (b) molecular 
assembly, (c) protein modification and (d) entropic chain activities (Uversky et al. 2008). 
Molecular recognition involves regulatory and signalling interactions which require a high 
specificity and low affinity interactions with a multitude of partners. In this sense, IDPs are 
much more promiscuous than structured proteins as they serve as nodes or hubs in protein 
interaction networks. Also, compared to their structured counterparts, IDPs can fold in order 
to perform a certain function by interacting with various partners (proteins, nucleic acids, 
membranes). This ability to fold makes IDPs highly vulnerable to dysfunction which 
scientists have identified as being the cause for a number of pathological conditions like 
cancer, neurodegenerative or cardiovascular diseases.  
2.2.3 Occurrence 
As mentioned before, intrinsic disorder is widespread in all the three kingdoms but with a 
larger prevalence in eukaryotes with precautious estimates of 5 to 15% of the proteins being 
fully intrinsically disordered and up to 35%-50% of the proteins having at least one 
intrinsically disordered region (IDR) (Orosz & Ov‡di 2011). Larger IDRs and a higher 
number of IDPs can be found in eukaryotes generally because of their complexity and of the 
higher need for regulation and signalling, which are top functions of intrinsic disorder.  
2.3 IDPs and their link to disease 
Proteins are the building blocks of life; thus, protein dysfunction can lead to the development 
of a series of pathological conditions. The causes for this pathogenesis can be protein 
misfolding, loss of regular function or acquiring of toxic function or protein aggregation. The 
misfolding and malfunction within these proteins can be caused by either point mutations or 
because of exposure to internal/external toxins or posttranslational modifications (set of 
chemical modification to the polypeptide chain after biosynthesis that extends the range of 
functions of the protein), degradation, lost binding partners or blocked trafficking (Uversky et 
al. 2009). 
Uversky et. al (2009) introduced the disorder in disorders or D
2 
concept which claims that 
there is an abundance of intrinsic disorder in proteins associated with various diseases. The 
authors presented an extensive review of the literature that linked IDPs to diseases varying 
from cancer and AIDS to cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases (ParkinsonÕs disease, 
HuntingtonÕs disease) via specific case studies.  We synthesise a few of the known disordered 
proteins that have been acknowledged to be involved in a series of human diseases. 
Cancer 
?-Fetoprotein (AFP) is an oncofoetal glycoprotein that has been identified as marker for the 
development of cancer or foetal abnormalities. P-53 is another protein extensively studied by 
researchers thanks to its capabilities of suppressing cancerous tumours. Lastly, the infamous 
BRCA-1 has been linked to breast cancer, as well as other types of cancer due to its 
involvement in many biological processes as signalling, transcription or oncogenesis 
(Uversky et al. 2008). 
Neurodegenerative diseases 
7 
?-Synuclein and Huntigtin are two disordered proteins linked to ParkinsonÕs Disease and 
Huntington Disease. These proteins are present in neurons and have a high propensity to 
aggregate with other partners; which means that chances of it folding into a stable structure 
are increased, which later can lead to malfunction (Uversky et al. 2008). 
Cardiovascular diseases 
Hirudin is an inhibitory protein that acts as a blood anticoagulant. Its C-terminal is essential 
for thrombin binding. Research has shown that this protein, when bound to thrombin, folds 
into a helix (an ordered structure) indicating the importance of understanding intrinsic 
disorder for protein-protein interactions (Uversky et al. 2008). 
This small overview of some of the major disease causing proteins identified to being 
intrinsically disordered highlights the connection already established by scientists between 
disease and intrinsically disordered proteins. The authors continued their analysis and plotted 
the percentage of disorder within known disease causing proteins. The outcome can be 
observed below:  
 
Figure 2.3 IDPs linked to disease (source: (Uversky et al. 2008)) 
It can be observed that 60% of the sampled proteins have at least 30 consecutive amino acids 
that fall within a disorder region. Overall, intrinsic disorder is widespread across cancer, 
diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases when compared to signalling proteins and structured 
proteins from PDB. 
 
Nevertheless, what are the reasons for this high correlation between intrinsic disorder and 
disease? Basically, IDPs possess specific features that make them susceptible to pathogenicity 
like induced folding (protein Ð protein interaction where binding is coupled with at least one 
of the partners folding), alternative splicing (process that leads to the creation of multiple 
mRNAs from a single precursor RNA strand through the inclusion or omission of certain 
8 
segments), functional regulation via PTMs, binding promiscuity (many hub proteins Ð those 
that interact with many partners; are actually intrinsically disordered) or binding plasticity 
(IDPs can be found in protein-protein interaction in two different modes: one-to-many 
signalling where one IDP can bind to many partners or many-to-one signalling where multiple 
IDPs can bind to one site on a partner).  
The main reason why the link between intrinsic disorder and human disease is explored is for 
the creation of new drugs that will inhibit the action/reaction of such a disease causing 
intrinsically disordered protein or it will limit the protein-protein interactions that could cause 
a certain disease to remain dormant.  
2.4 Conclusion 
Proteins are the basic components for maintaining life; they are molecule composed of 
polymers of amino acids, which determines the structure and function of the protein. 
However, this paradigm has proven not to hold when speaking of intrinsically disordered 
proteins (which lack a tertiary structure, making them unable to fold into something known, 
yet preserving vital functions). These sorts of proteins are highly soluble, capable of 
interacting with more than one partner, as well as folding when bond with an ordered protein. 
In the past decade, academia has accepted the existence of these proteins and recently has 
linked them to a series of grave human diseases. A plausible cause for the IDPs pathogenicity 
is protein misfolding, which can be caused, among other things, by single point mutations. 
The following chapter will go further in-depth into these types of mutations. 
 
9 
3 Single nucleotide polymorphisms 
Non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) or single amino acid 
polymorphisms (SAAPs) are point mutations which are deleterious to gene function and often 
are labelled as disease causing. In this chapter we will provide a definition of SNPs, their link 
to disease and we will present the existing SNP databases. 
3.1 Definition 
In general, a single nucleotide polymorphism represents a variation in the DNA sequence 
when a single nucleotide (A, T, C or G) in the sequence is altered. These mutations are the 
most frequent type of variation found in nature and offer a plethora of information on genetic 
determinants of complex diseases. In humans, SNPs account for more than 90% of sequence 
difference with an average frequency of about one per 1000 bases (Wang & Moult 2001).  
SNPs can fall within a coding or non-coding region. The phenotype is affected only when the 
SNP falls within a coding region and the SNP is either a missense or nonsense mutation. 
When talking about missense and nonsense mutations though, we talk about single amino acid 
polymorphisms (SAAP) which represent point mutations at the amino acid level within a 
protein sequence; they are also called non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(nsSNP). Compared to nucleotides, there are 20 amino acids with various physicochemical 
properties; a single amino acid mutation can lead to a change in function at the protein level 
which can prove to be deleterious to the organism. Non-synonymous SNPs can be regarded as 
genetic markers of phenotypic traits like diseases; they may also be subject to natural 
selection. 
A general definition of non-synonymous SNPs is of a point mutation where a single 
nucleotide is changed which then results in a codon that will code for a different amino acid (a 
codon is a three nucleotide combination that encodes the information for one of the 20 amino 
acids existing in nature). nsSNPs are categorised as disease causing or neutral. More 
specifically, non synonymous SNPs are usually disease causing whilst synonymous ones do 
not change the structure/function of the protein, i.e. the amino acid substitution is neutral in 
that the substituted residue has the same characteristics as the original. General statistics find 
that 50% of mutations fall within non-coding regions, 25% lead to an amino acid substitution 
whilst the remaining 25% are silent (Shastry 2003). In the end, SNPs capture the diversity 
within a population and the individualÕs responsiveness or susceptibility to disease. 
3.2 Disease causing mutations 
It is imperative to mention that SNPs do not cause disease directly yet they affect disease 
development. Moreover, SNPs are an extraordinary source of information concerning the 
evolutionary history of the human population, its development and its diseases. Alleles 
represent the forms a gene or genetic locus can take. Genetic disorder occurs when an 
individual acquires two recessive alleles for a genetic trait (single point mutations occur in 
these alleles).  
Since the start of the 1000 Genome Project, scientists have struggled to develop SNP maps for 
purposes as evolutionary biology studies, gene discovery, diagnostic testing, prediction and 
10 
responsiveness of various drugs. SNPs can be used for homogeneity testing and 
pharmacogenetic studies that could lead, at first to the identification of common diseases like 
heart pressure or diabetes and later, after a thorough understanding of intrinsically disordered 
proteins, of more complex diseases like cancer or neurodegenerative and cardiovascular 
diseases (Shastry 2003).   
Missense mutations can occur both in structured as well as in intrinsically disordered proteins; 
NsSNPs in structured proteins can influence the folding of the amino acid chain, the whole 
stability and structure of the protein or its solubility level, while a mutation within an IDP can 
lead to loss/gain of interaction within the protein network, PTMs, or disruptions within the 
structure (causing a disordered region to become ordered) (Vacic & Iakoucheva 2012).  These 
modification, in turn can lead to a loss or gain of function that may be pathogenic. The figure 
below graphically emphasizes the consequences missense mutations can have on both types 
of proteins.

Finding cohesive data sources on point mutations is not as straightforward as one might think 
however. There are a multitude of available databases; nevertheless, most of them present the 
data either at gene level, or the annotations included are not of the high-quality needed for this 
project. The following two sections will briefly describe the databases used as data source. 
11 
3.2.1 UniProtKB/SwissProt database 
UniProtKB/SwissProt is a highly specialized, manually curated protein sequence and 
knowledge database that concentrates on protein entries from humans (Boeckmann 2003). It 
is an extremely useful source of information for each protein as the manual annotations are 
extracted from scientific literature and use standardized nomenclature.  
The UniProtKB/SwissProt database is the starting point for finding the relevant data for this 
thesis as this repository contains the unprocessed data needed for answering our research 
question. 
3.2.2 SwissVar 
The SwissVar portal is a collection of single amino acid polymorphisms and diseases 
retrieved from the UniProtKB /Swiss-Prot databases. It provides a unique environment for 
researchers to investigate the relationship between human variants and phenotypes. Compared 
to other repositories, SwissVar offers the possibility of searching the database for similar 
diseases and not just by the query protein sequence. Another aspect that makes SwissVar 
more attractive for our research is the inclusion of disease and phenotype information 
associated with a particular mutation; the other databases proved to be relatively unstructured 
and offering only general gene-centric information. At present, the database includes 3300 
diseases and 66,397 human protein variations with 22,892 known to be disease variants, 
37,159 netrual variants and 5,346 unclassified (Mottaz et al. 2010).  The accession codes for 
each protein that contains point mutations are extracted and used in the UniProtKB/SwissProt 
database to acquire the protein sequences (based on the SwissVar accession codes).

4 IDP predictors 
So far we have presented what intrinsically disordered proteins and non-synonymous single 
nucleotide polymorphisms are. We have discussed the functions and structures of these 
entities, as well as the databases where they can be downloaded from. The goal of this thesis 
was to analyze whether there is a direct relationship between point mutations and intrinsically 
disordered proteins in terms of pathogenicity based on a single feature, i.e. the conservation 
status of the amino acid mutation. Since this question has yet to be answered within the 
bioinformatics field, it is imperative to present the tools needed to identify these mutations. At 
the moment there are over 60 intrinsically disorder protein predictors, but the methodology is 
still in its infancy. There is no commonly accepted criterion on selecting these IDPs and the 
best so far only distinguishes between long or short IDPs because of the different 
characteristics of such regions. In fact, the predictive algorithms that work properly on long 
disordered regions or IDPs perform poorly on short ones (Peng et al. 2005). Nevertheless, 
protein structure prediction is one of the most important fields of study in bioinformatics and 
shifting from the saturated structured protein market onto the newly intrinsically disordered 
one will be beneficial from a medical point of view since the link with human disease has 
already been acknowledged by the scientific community. In this chapter we will present the 
predictors for intrinsic disorder trialled for this thesis. 
The existing IDP predictors use features such as the amino acid composition corroborated 
with the physicochemical properties of amino acids to determine whether the query sequence 
falls within a disordered region or not. Others use the amino acid sequence scores derived 
from PSI-BLAST (bioinformatics algorithm to compare protein sequences for similarities) or 
from protein secondary structure information. The most popular classifiers are based either on 
Neural Networks or on Support Vector Machines learning models. However, not all of the 
following methods use the same criteria for disorder. Moreover, the existing predictors should 
be taken at face value since all of them present both advantages and disadvantages and none 
can be deemed superior over another at a significant level. It is actually recommended to 
combine two or more of these predictors in order to avoid pitfalls like when few homologues 
are available or high false positives due to too many homologues being identified. 
Nevertheless, the choice of disorder predictor is highly dependent on the types of research 
questions the scientists are trying to answer. 
To help the scientific field, a series of experiments called Critical Assessment of protein 
Structure Prediction (CASP) have been developed since 1994 in order to test all predictors in 
an unbiased matter. Every year, the new predictors are benchmarked against the old ones and 
new features are scrutinized for their information gain. Based on the current academic 
preferences for disorder predictions we will present the algorithms used by DISOPRED2, 
PONDR VSL2 and IUPred. 
4.1 DISOPRED2 
The DISOPRED2 server uses a knowledge-based algorithm to predict IDPs from the amino 
acid sequence. Just like the first predictor, DISOPRED 2 trains a neural network to analyse 
the sequence profiles generated by running iteratively PSI-BLAST 3 times. Basically, each 
amino acid is profiled from the PSI-BLAST and classified using the neural network. Then, the 
actual disorder predictor uses a support vector machine algorithm that outputs a probability 
for the amino acid to fall in a disordered region or not (Jones & Ward 2003).  
13 
 
The training set included those proteins with available X-ray structures in the PDB database. 
In order to correctly identify the disordered regions within the protein sequence, the amino 
acid sequence (SEQRES records) was aligned with the ATOM records (or alpha-carbon 
coordinates); the SEQRES and ATOM records represent the sequence of the protein and the 
amino acid coordinates respectively in the PDB format. A region was deemed disordered if 
and only if the amino acids found in the SEQRES records did not correspond to those in the 
ATOM records.  
The performance of the predictor is benchmarked to the targets derived from CASP5 (2005). 
The authors did indeed notice that the data are slightly overfitted when the disordered region 
with less than 0.8 confidence are included in the SVM predictor. Given the binary nature of 
the answer (that the protein is disordered or not) and the disparity between the sizes of the 
structured and disordered protein classes, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient is used (Jones 
& Ward 2003).  
The DISOPRED predictor was developed with the aim of identifying short disordered 
proteins/regions using the amino acid sequence after scoring with the Position Specific 
Scoring Matrix (PSSM) utilized by PSI-BLAST to determine a profile of the amino acids in 
the query protein sequence. The CASP5 experiments deemed it significant for identifying 
short regions devoid of secondary structure.  
4.2 PONDR family 
PONDR or Predictor of Naturally Disordered Regions is a set of algorithms used for disorder 
prediction within protein regions. The PONDR family works primarily from primary 
sequence data. The predictors use a number of standard feed forward neural networks that 
incorporate sequence information derived from sliding windows of 9 to 21 amino acids 
(http://www.pondr.com/). 
The PONDR family includes 9 meta-predictors with the most famous ones PONDR VL-XT 
and PONDR VSL2. The first one is actually three predictors merged into one, one trained on 
Variously Long disordered regions and two trained on X-ray characterized Terminal 
disordered regions (http://www.pondr.com/pondr-tut2.html).    
The PONDR VL-XT neural network includes a small number of attributes among which: 
amino acid composition, amino acid net charge and average coordination number (number of 
neighbours a residue has). The algorithm will predict the order-disorder class for every amino 
acid in the query sequence. The algorithm is particularly useful in identifying the regions that 
are undergoing disorder to order transitions (Doszt‡nyi et al. 2010).  
The PONDR VSL2 is a combination of two predictors optimized both for long (>30 residues) 
and short (<30 residues) disordered regions. This predictor is constructed as a linear support 
vector machine compared to previous versions which used logistic regression models. 
PONDR VSL2 successfully addressed the length-dependency problem that most IDP 
predictors faced and proved to outperform  both the VL-XT and the DISOPRED2 predictors 
at per residue values (Peng et al. 2006).  
14 
The PONDR family encompasses a series of disorder predictors that work on short, long and 
both types of disorder regions; all algorithms output scores for individual residues facilitating 
the analysis of the data at a per residue level. Unfortunately, all PONDR predictors are 
computationally expensive in terms of the time needed to output the results per protein as it 
uses PSI-BLAST for each queried protein. 
4.3 IUPred 
IUPred is a very effective disorder predictor that has a different approach from the rest of the 
classifiers out there. It addresses the causes that lead a protein not to fold; basically, if an 
amino acid cannot form enough intra-chain contacts, then it will not be able to adopt a stable 
locus in the 3D structure of the chain (Doszt‡nyi et al. 2010). If such amino acids cluster 
together for a portion or the whole of the amino acid chain then that protein will be deemed 
intrinsically disordered. The algorithm the authors implement is based on statistical potential 
(energy functions derived from the analysis of known protein structures found in the Protein 
data Bank). More specifically, the pairwise energy of a protein is a function of its amino acid 
sequence and its conformation.  They construct a 20x20 interaction matrix based on all the 
amino acids existent in nature and assign each pair a number signifying their energy content 
(Doszt‡nyi et al. 2005).  
The algorithm developed allows the authors to assess the foldability of proteins even when the 
structural model is absent. There is no training involved as the delineation between disordered 
and ordered proteins is done based on the energy content of each amino acid pair. The scoring 
for each position is computed by only taking into consideration interaction partners that are 2 
to 100 residues apart in each direction. The score is then smoothed over a sliding window of 
21 amino acids. This new predictor was tested on a set of globular proteins and proved to 
outperform both DISOPRED2 and PONDRVL3H (another algorithm from the PONDR 
family that specializes in identifying long disordered regions, i.e. larger than 30 residues) 
(Doszt‡nyi et al. 2005). 
The predictor itself is straightforward to use; it takes as input the individual amino acid 
sequence and outputs a score between 0 and 1 for each amino acid; everything that has a score 
above 0.5 is considered to be disordered. The computational time is extremely fast, making 
this predictor a viable candidate for our data analysis. 
 
4.4 Conclusion 
Different empirical studies have proven that no one single disorder predictor will correctly 
reveal the structure of a protein. However, in combination and depending on the end result 
needed for the research, some predictors perform quite well. For instance, if the purpose of a 
study is to identify large disordered regions, then PONDR VL3 will prove optimal (Doszt‡nyi 
et al. 2010). DISOPRED2 is useful for identifying smaller disordered segments. PONDR VL-
XT and VSL2 together with IUPred are preferred for identifying both short and long 
disordered regions. 
In order to select the best disorder predictor for our thesis we started off by identifying what 
was actually needed for answering our research question. Since we are investigating disease 
15 
causing point mutations within disordered proteins/regions we needed a predictor that would 
output a single score per residue. All of the above mentioned predictors give this output. 
However, we also needed an algorithm that would be fast and easy to integrate within our Perl 
script. All of the predictors were implemented in C, but the decisive factor that led us into 
choosing IUPred was its speed. Both IUPred and PONDR VSL2 need the extra step of 
accessing PSI-BLAST and identifying homologues which is time consuming. 
In conclusion, we considered that IUPred is easiest to adopt given our task and is extremely 
efficient, time wise at outputting a disorder score.

5 SNP predictors 
Earlier we have identified the importance of understanding intrinsically disordered proteins 
and their link to disease. IDPs are more susceptible to misfolding or malfunction because of, 
for instance, binding to a different partner or alternative splicing or posttranslational 
modifications or because of a missesnse mutation. In this chapter we will identify the current 
state of the art SNP predictors and discuss the ones that have incorporated features for 
measuring the level of disorder within a protein. 
Non synonymous SNPs have been in the limelight ever since the whole human genome was 
completely mapped. Since then, scientists have concentrated on developing predictors that 
will determine when an nsSNP is deleterious or neutral. Most of the available tools identify 
and annotate the function altering and disease associated amino acid substitutions based only 
on either the protein sequence or the protein structure; they fail to identify the changes 
brought up by molecular functions introduced or altered by a missense mutation. Based on 
this caveat, tools concentrating solely on predicting the disease causing nsSNPs have been 
developed; SIFT (P. C. Ng 2003) and PolyPhen2 (Ramensky et al. 2002)(I. a Adzhubei et al. 
2010) are the ones mostly used on average. Apart from these though, different methodologies 
have arisen, but the most widely used ones are 1) empirical rule-based, 2) probabilistic 
models and 3) machine learning approaches.   
Nevertheless, it must be mentioned that all of the existing predictors are built for structured 
proteins. Unfortunately, the properties of folded proteins are different from those of IDPs and 
implying that these predictors will perform well in disordered regions is simply erroneous. 
Some of the more recent nsSNP predictors have incorporated a special attribute into the 
classifier that verifies, with the help of disorder predictors, whether the mutation falls within a 
disordered region or not. This inclusion is a step up towards recognizing the importance of 
disordered proteins for human pathogenicity.  
In this chapter we will present the most common SNP predictors available, together with 
some new classifiers that incorporate disorder among their features.  
5.1 SIFT 
SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) is a classifier that through the aid of homology 
verifies whether an amino acid substitution could alter the protein function and hence the 
phenotype (P. C. Ng 2003). The SIFT algorithm utilizes only the protein sequence to infer its 
predictions, yet, it registers performances similar to those predictors that use structure 
(Pauline C Ng & Steven Henikoff 2002). The algorithm follows two steps: first, the 
homologues of the query sequence are obtained through multiple sequence alignment by 
performing PSI-BLAST on the SWISS-PROT database with two iterations; secondly, the 
amino acid substitution is given a probability score based on the alignment for that given 
position obtained in the previous step. The algorithm verifies the obtained probability against 
a threshold in order to infer that the amino acid substitution indeed altered the protein 
function. 
The SIFT algorithm only uses one key feature, and that is conservation which is computed for 
each position of the residues for every potential sequence alignments. Then, the median 
conservation over all the amino acid positions within a sequence is computed and if it does 
17 
not fall under a user-defined threshold then this protein hit is preserved and added to the final 
alignment. This process continues until the threshold is reached. The final alignment will 
include all protein hits with conservation levels above the threshold. To diminish noise from 
pseudo genes, all sequences which are more than 90% identical to the query sequence are 
removed from the final alignment.  
For the second step, the alignment obtained in the first step is converted into a Position 
Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM). A PSSM is a 20x L (length of the protein sequence) matrix 
where each cell contains the probability of an amino acid a found at position c (pca) to be 
replaced by any of the remaining 19 amino acids. The formula the authors developed is: 
    
  
     
     
  
     
     
Where Nc is the total number of sequences in the alignment; Bc is the total number of 
pseudocounts; gca is the sequence-weighted frequency that amino acid a will appear at 
position c in the alignment; fca pseudocouns computed from Dirichlet mixtures (P C Ng & S 
Henikoff 2001). 
SIFT is a very useful tool for identifying exactly how protein function is altered given an 
amino acid substitution/missense mutation. 
5.2 PolyPhen2 
PolyPhen2 (polymorphism phenotyping) is a server for functional annotation of coding 
nsSNPs (Ramensky et al. 2002). It also provides a method for predicting damaging missense 
mutations. A Naive Bayes classifier is used to determine whether a missesnse mutation is 
deleterious or not. Compared to the first PolyPhen algorithm, PolyPhen2 has been greatly 
improved in terms of predictive features, alignment pipeline and method of classification (I. a 
Adzhubei et al. 2010). 
The automated sequence alignment pipeline follows a 6 step procedure: 
1. The user inputs an nsSNP or sequence; 
2. With the query sequence in place, PSI-BLAST is performed on the Uniref100 
database to retrieve the homologues; 
3. Then the amino acid sequences found in the previous step are aligned using MAFFT 
(Katoh et al. 2002); MAFFT aligns homologues through Fast Fourier Transform; 
4. To minimize the noise contained in the alignments because of the poor-quality 
segments, the LEON software is used; homology is predicted only from complete 
sequences (Thompson et al. 2004); 
5. The remaining sequences are clustered together and only the cluster containing the 
query sequence is preserved; this step is done using the Secator algorithm (Wicker et 
al. 2001); 
6. Lastly, the Position Specific Independent Counts (PSIC) profile is computed and the 
final alignment scores are obtained (S. R. Sunyaev et al. 1999); the profile score 
indicates how likely it is for a certain amino acid to occupy a specific position within 
the protein sequence. 
18 
From the homologues found through multiple sequence alignment, the characteristic features 
of the classifier are extracted. The top feature with the highest information gain verifies how 
likely the mutation is to occur given the multiple sequence alignment and how distant is the 
protein that had the first point mutation from the wild-type. 
PolyPhen2 uses a total of 11 features automatically selected with the aid of a greedy 
algorithm. These features are then implemented to train a Naive Bayes classifier in identifying 
the likelihood of a missense mutation to affect the protein function and phenotype. Naive 
Bayes performed equally well as other classifiers like logistic regression or decision trees, but 
because of the simplicity and reduced computation time Naive Bayes was chosen (I. A. 
Adzhubei et al. n.d.). Moreover, PolyPhen2 is trained on two different datasets (HumDiv and 
HumVar). 
5.3 SySAP 
SySAP (System-level predictor of deleterious Single Amino Acid Polymorphisms) is the 
newest predictor of deleterious single amino acid polymorphisms available. It was developed 
in 2010 and brought in the form of a server to the academic world in 2012. SySap is a new 
classifier where each Single Amino Acid Polymorphism is coded using 472 features derived 
from the transformed scores of the amino acid index, PSSMs, structural features and 
betweenness and the KEGG enrichment scores of the protein neighbours (the KEGG pathway 
is a network specific features and describes the molecular interaction and reaction networks 
for human diseases) (Huang et al. 2010). All 472 features are further analysed using the 
Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) and Incremental Feature Selection 
(IFS) in order to obtain the optimal number of features to be used. After this, the prediction 
method for the server that the authors choose is the LinlineaR machine learning approach 
because it performs best in a short time and on large sample datasets (Huang et al. 2012).  
Apart from protein network features, SySAP also included features of the disorder scores. 
These scores were calculated using the PONDR VSL2 algorithm. On top of the disordered 
scores for each amino acid comprised in the sequence, the authors also identified whether the 
mutation falls within a disordered region or not. They run BLAST on the query sequence 
against the DisProt database and based on the hits generated by BLAST they transferred the 
annotated disorder region to the query sequence (Huang et al. 2010). 
Out of the 472 features the original paper included, only 9 were disorder related features. 
Unfortunately, the authors do not mention how many of these disorder features survived after 
applying the mRMR algorithm to determine the features with the highest information gain. 
There is a high chance that these features were dropped partially from the final list of features 
that was actually fed to the classifier, possibly leaving disorder out of the classification.  
The authors benchmarked their results against the SIFT predictor and reported that SySAP 
performed better (around the 80% mark) in comparison to SIFT (around 71%). Nevertheless, 
it must be mentioned that SIFT bases its prediction solely on the conservation scores derived 
from PSSM whilst SySAP includes more hundreds of features that are bound to overfit the 
data. 
 
19 
5.4 Conclusion 
Apart from SySAP, no other mutation predictor has included features that measure the level 
of disorder within a protein. Unfortunately, this is mostly because the links between disease 
causing mutations and disordered proteins has yet to be explored. In this thesis we started 
from the hypothesis that point mutations within disordered regions that have an impact on the 
level of disorder may be disease causing.  Answering this question is useful for identifying 
which features must be included in larger scale mutation predictors in terms of identifying 
intrinsic disorder. This could explain why the disorder features incorporated by the SySAP 
authors did not prove conclusive. 
IDPs exhibit a different evolution rate and amino acid substitution patterns than structured 
proteins; because of this, when applying SIFT or any other deleterious SNP predictor these 
mutations can be wrongly labelled as neutral (because of the different conservation status) 
(Bagchi et al. 2011).  
Both SIFT and PolyPhen2 are two credible SNP predictors that have credibility since they are 
used as benchmark for newer predictors. Incorporating disorder features into SNP predictors 
of this calibre could add another dimension to the area of point mutation and possibly help 
classify mutations that before had a great deal of uncertainty attached to them.

6 Extant research on disease mutations and disorder 
This chapter will give an overview of the current academic literature on the topic of disease 
and mutations within intrinsic disorder. The field is in its infancy which would explain the 
scarcity of research done. 
6.1 Disease mutations in disordered regions 
The first paper published in 2012 looks at the disease causing mutations found in disordered 
regions and analyze the impact these mutations would have on the protein disorder (Vacic & 
Iakoucheva 2012). The central theme of the paper is to identify the functional impact of 
mutations in disordered regions. The authors pinpoint the idea that structured protein SNP 
predictors will classify mutations within non-conserved regions (or disordered regions) as 
benign or tolerant, thus missing potentially disease causing mutations. They identify the 
effects mutation could have on IDPs in the form of hypotheses that mutations may impact 
disordered regions at the protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and protein Ð ligand 
interactions level; they can also affect posttranslational modifications, as well as signalling 
and regulatory networks. 
To support their allegations, the authors downloaded all the disease associated mutations 
within the UniProt database and ranked the substitutions according to their frequency in 
mutant proteins. They identified a series of amino acid substitutions that cause a disordered 
protein to become more ordered and vice-versa. They also only concentrated on certain amino 
acid substitutions that they have found to be recurrent within their dataset. Moreover, they 
have extracted a series of known disordered proteins based on the DisProt database and 
analysed their disorder to order transitions. The authors focused more on particular cases 
refraining from making overall conclusions since their analysis was more theoretically rooted. 
They did not incorporate their findings into a classifier but advocate for further research to be 
done in the area of mutations (be them missense, nonsense, splice or indels) within intrinsic 
disorder for a better understanding of the functional changes these mutations can have at the 
protein level.  
6.2 Changes in predicted protein disorder tendency contributes to risk disease 
The second paper looks to identify those single nucleotide variants (SNV) which lead to an 
amino acid substitution that will change the function and disorder tendency of a protein (Hu et 
al. 2011). The data they used was gene centric and consisted of simulated autosomal genes as 
a preview to what scientists would expect to find analysing real data. The authors first 
mapped the mutations within the amino acid sequence and then verified a mutationÕs ability to 
alter disorder by adjusting the disorder score obtained through the PONDR VSL2 algorithm. 
the mutation-induced change in disorder prediction scores (ÆDS) is computed to identify 
whether a significant change in a protein caused by a mutation leads to malfunctions and 
disease development. Again, the paper did not construct an actual predictor of disease causing 
mutations within disordered regions, but merely adjusted the disorder score for the given 
amino acid substitution obtained via an IDP predictor. They also did not determine a sensible 
threshold for separating harmful mutations from harmless ones. 
21 
The two papers above are the precursors of the future deleterious SNP predictors within 
disordered regions. They offered a good starting point in terms of approaches in analyzing the 
potential of change in structure from Disorder-to-Order that a mutation can have on 
disordered regions. Most significant method that could prove useful for this project is the 
mutation-induced change in disorder prediction scores (?DS = DSmin - DSmaj, where DSmin  
and DSmaj are the disorder scores for minor and major alleles respectively) which measure the 
ability of a mutation to structurally change a region to form disorder/structure. 
22 
7 Data Preprocessing 
This chapter acts as a guide into the preparation of the dataset for its further analysis. We first 
determine the data sources and then describe the method used for parsing the proteins for 
obtaining both the wild and mutant protein sequences into the right format. 
7.1 Data sources 
One of the most challenging tasks of our project was finding the right data and pre-processing 
it for further analysis. Because of its high quality and extensive manual annotations we chose 
the UniProtKB/SwissProt database as our main source of information, together with the 
SwissVar portal which hosts all the mutations within the SwissProt database. Since we chose 
to deal only with human disease, we used the humsavar.txt file, which is a variation of the 
SwissVar file that contains the protein accession codes and amino acid changes only for 
human mutations.  
Before going more in-depth we will explain what wild and mutated proteins are. A wild 
protein sequence refers to the linear amino acid chain in its original state. A mutated protein 
sequence is the linear amino acid chain that at a certain locus (i.e. where the point mutation 
occurs) the amino acid differs from the one found in the wild protein sequence. 
We used two main raw data files: the uniprot_sprot.fasta file containing all the wild (not 
mutated) protein sequences from the UniProtKB/SwissProt database and humsavar.txt 
containing a list of wild proteins for which their mutations have been annotated as disease 
carrying or not. 
The UniProt/SwissProt file contains approximately 4 million rows of amino acid strings (or 
more than 800 thousand protein sequences) so we extracted only the relevant 66,397 protein 
sequences which are annotated in humsavar.txt. 
Table 7-1 shows a sample of rows from humsavar.txt. There are three relevant columns from 
this table that we used: Swiss-Prot AC which contains the accession code that we used to 
extract the protein sequences from the Uniprot/Swissprot file, AA change which encodes the 
mutation that the wild protein suffered, and the Type of variant column which labels the 
mutation as being disease causing, non-disease causing (polymorphism) or unclassified.

7.2 Parsing the protein sequences 
To give a better explanation of the data preparation process we take as an example the first 
row from Table 7-1. The accession number is P04217 which we will use to extract its protein 
sequence from the UniProtKB/SwissProt file. The actual extracted protein sequence is shown 
in Table 7-2. The first row follows the standard fasta format containing the accession number 
P04217 and other annotations. The fasta format is a text-based format for representing a 
protein sequence, in our case at the amino acid level in a single letter format.  The first line 
contains representative information about the protein like the database it is found in, its 
accession code, the name of the protein, the species etc.

Having the wild protein sequence we now need to obtain the mutated version. To do this we 
use the mutation code in the column AA change: p.His52Arg. This code is interpreted as a 
mutation at position 52 in the amino acid string from His to Arg. We cannot use the three 
letter amino acid codes in their original format so we had to transform them into one letter 
codes by using Table 7-3.

As mentioned in chapter 4, we have decided to use the IUPred disorder predictor since it gives 
an output in the form we require and it is computationally fast and easier to integrate within 
the Perl script than the other two predictors presented earlier. 
After obtaining the wild and mutated protein sequences we can feed them into IUPred to 
obtain the disorder scores for each of the two variants. Table 7-6 shows a selection of the 
results for our example protein with accession number P04217. The left half of the table 
shows the disorder scores for each amino acid in the wild protein and the right half shows the 
scores for the mutated protein. We extracted the scores at the mutation position, the average 
of a symmetrical 11 amino acid window and a 21 amino acid window (5 respectively 10 
amino acids on each side of the mutation  locus).

Table 7-7 Two of the three files that we will use for analysis containing: accession number with a mutation code, disease 
label, IUPred score of the original (wild) protein and IUPred score of the mutated protein. The file in the left contains 
average disorder scores for a window of 11 amino acids and the one in the right for a window of 21 amino acids. 
The data preprocessing was a challenging scripting task which we implemented in Perl as the 
datasets are not readily available; the wild protein sequences needed to be extracted from the 
larger UniProtKB/SwissProt database, while the mutated sequences need to be obtained one 
by one through the method described above in a fasta format. Lastly, IUPred accepts only one 
sequence at a time, thus constructing an efficient script to run all proteins and store the 
disorder amino acid scores correctly was vital.

8 Data Analysis 
This chapter contains a detailed analysis of the data and an explanation of the classifiers that 
we designed with. The actual performance of these classifiers will be presented in chapter 9. 
8.1 Levels of disorder within the dataset 
The starting point in analysing our data is to build a cross table and count the samples based 
on several cases: wild disorder score greater or less than 0.5, mutated disorder score greater or 
less than 0.5, disease equal to 1 or 0. Table 8-1 shows these counts for the case when we 
extract only the mutated amino acids disorder score from IUPred (amino acid window = 1). 
Ordered proteins have been extensively more studied in the literature than intrinsically 
disordered proteins and this can be seen from the table as well: here are four times more 
ordered (score wild < 0.5) cases in the dataset than disordered (score wild > 0.5) based on the 
wild disorder score. The same situation is found if we analyse the counts based on the mutated 
disorder score but the ration is slightly higher.  Important findings are that 19.77% of 
mutations fall in disordered regions and 19.13% of mutations from disordered regions are 
disease causing. What is interesting is that it happens very rarely that a protein goes from 
disorder to order state or order to disorder state when suffering a mutation: 8.02% of the cases 
present disorder to order transitions and 1.50% of the cases are order to disorder transitions.

Table 8-1 Sample counts for several cases of the variables wild disorder score, mutated disorder score and disease for the 
case when the amino acid window is equal to one. In total there are in total 60,051 sequences presented in this table. 
Table 8-2 shows the same attributes as Table 8-1 for the average scores for a window of 11 
amino acids. The total number of protein sequences in this table is smaller due to the fact that 
some of the mutations occurred too close to the ends of the proteins, therefore we did not have 
enough data to calculate the average of the amino acid window. What we are most interested 
in is if there are any significant changes in the counts due to the increase in the window size. 
It seems there are no significant differences most likely due to the fact that a point mutation 
not only changes a single disorder score but it also changes the disorder scores around it: 
19.33% of mutations fall in disordered regions, 18.69% mutations from disordered regions are 
disease causing, 7.65% disorder to order transitions and 1.61% order to disorder transitions.

Table 8-2 Sample counts for several cases of the variables wild disorder score, mutated disorder score and disease for the 
case when the amino acid window is equal to eleven. In total there are in total 59,876 sequences presented in this table. 
Table 8-3 shows the same attributes as Table 8-1 for the average scores for a window of 21 
amino acids. The number of total sequences is actually equal to the ones in Table 8-2 which 
means that there were no point mutations at a distance from any end of the sequence between 
5 and 10 amino acids. However, the disorder scores have shifted leading to more cases of 
ordered sequences based both on the wild and mutated disorder scores. The increase in the 
proportion of ordered sequences is due to the fact that by increasing the window size to 21 
amino acids from 11 we now include more disorder scores smaller than 0.5 from amino acids 
which were not involved in the mutation. The percentages of interest are not too different 
from the previous two tables but the direction of their change can be easily explained for 
some of the cases: 18.87% mutations fall now in disordered regions (due to the lower 
proportion of disordered sequences), 18.45% mutations from disordered regions are disease 
causing (this happened probably because more sequences with disease have become ordered 
due to the increase in window size), 7.79% disorder to order transitions and 1.45% order to 
disorder transitions (the total number of transitions being similar to Table 8-2).

Table 8-3 Sample counts for several cases of the variables wild disorder score, mutated disorder score and disease for the 
case when the amino acid window is equal to twenty one. In total there are in total 59,876 sequences presented in this table 
8.2 Initial graphical analysis 
In this section we will present scatter plot and bivariate distribution analyses which will 
provide the motivation for the direction of the rest of this thesis. 
While giving us a general idea and a way to check if there are any errors in our data, the tables 
with counts were not detailed enough for our purpose. We went further to look at the data by 
plotting scatter plots. The top of Figure 8-1 contains a scatter plot of the wild disorder scores 
(  axis) versus the mutated disorder scores (  axis) with colour labelling of the disease class 
(blue for polymorphism or not disease and green for disease) for the amino acid window size 
equal to one. What is first evident from this scatter plot is that there are no large transitions in 
the disorder scores after a mutation because all the points are situated close to the 45 degree 
line. This result is to be expected as a single mutation cannot completely change a disorder 
score from one extreme to the other. The density of points is larger in the region with order 
(where        and       ) which is in line with what we saw in the count tables. 
28 
Another feature of the data is that although diseased and not diseased proteins are found 
throughout the range of scores, there is large clustering of diseased proteins in the region of 
ordered proteins (with        and       ). Not diseased proteins seem to be more 
prevalent in the region of disordered proteins (with        and       ), but there is also 
a strong presence of diseased proteins at the very extreme of disorder (where      and 
    ).  
We now want to check the symmetry of the transitions from disorder to order and order to 
disorder. The lower part of Figure 8-1shows a scatter plot where we now have the   axis 
representing the difference between the mutated and wild disorder scores (     ). The 
transitions look very symmetrical abut we do see a small difference around the region with a 
very large wild disorder score (where     ). Generally the findings from the scatter plots 
are in line with what we have seen in the tables but they do bring extra precision in our 
analysis. 
 
Figure 8-1 The first figure is a scatter plot of the wild disorder score (x axis) versus the mutated disorder score (y axis) for 
the amino acid window size equal to one. The second figure presents on the y axis the difference between the mutated 
disorder scores and the wild disorder scores. The diseased instances are marked with green whereas the polymorphisms (no 
disease) are marked with blue. 
29 
We further want to check if there is any significant difference in the general distribution of the 
data in the case where the amino acid window is increased. Due to space constraints we only 
show the case with a window size of 21 in Figure 8-2. The general conclusion is that apart 
from a difference in the total sample size (fewer points in this case) there is no significant 
difference evident from these scatter plots. 
 
Figure 8-2 The first figure is a scatterplot of the wild disorder score (  axis) versus the mutated disorder score (  axis) for 
the amino acid window size equal to twenty one. The second figure presents on the   axis the difference between the mutated 
disorder scores and the wild disorder scores. The diseased instances are marked with green whereas the polymorphisms (no 
disease) are marked with blue. 
To go further in our analysis we now wanted to be able to see what the frequency of the data 
for each region in the       space was. We achieved this by plotting the bivariate 
histograms of the disease and polymorphism cases in Figure 8-3. Starting with the upper part 
of the graph, representing the case where the window size is equal to one, we observe that 
there is an extremely large number of sequences (     ) with disorder scores approximately 
equal to zero (where      and     ). This is in line with the general trend for scientists 
to study mostly structured proteins which have an extremely low disorder score. The diseased 
(   ) proteins show a peak of frequency on the first diagonal with the highest frequencies 
30 
at the very extremes of the       space. At the same time, the polymorphism instances also 
show higher frequency on the first diagonal but with smoother transition, leading to a lower 
peak proportionally at the maximum of the       space (     and     ). This is very 
valuable information for our project as there seems to be a higher probability of disease 
especially where      and     . The lower part of the figure containing the case where 
the window size is equal to 21 supports the same conclusion, the only difference being that 
there are fewer observations and the extreme at (         ) is less pronounced. 
 
Figure 8-3 Bivariate histograms of the disease (d=1, left) and polymorphisms (d=0, right) cases for window sizes 1 (top) and 
21 (bottom). The   axis represents the wild disorder score (  ) and the   axis the mutated disorder score (  ) the   axis 
represents the counts. 
8.3 The first classifier: difference of probability density functions 
In this section we will present our first idea of a scoring function which can be used to 
classify proteins based on their wild and mutated disorder scores. 
At this stage we are already seeing quite detailed features of the data. However the total 
counts are not directly comparable as they have different scales. Therefore we proceed in 
scaling the counts with their total sum obtaining the empirical probability density functions. 
31 
Figure 8-4 displays six different probability density functions for the case with amino acid 
window equal to one. We start the discussion of the figure with the left half which 
corresponds to the data sample with          and          . The first surface plot 
corresponds to the probability density function for the disease instances and it shows the usual 
peaks at the extremes of the       space with high probability along the first diagonal. The 
second surface plot corresponds to the polymorphisms and the third plot is equal to their 
difference. The shape of the difference paints a clear picture: along the diagonal there is a 
higher probability of the mutation being a polymorphism (   ), at the extremes where 
(     )  (   )  and (     )  (   ) there is a very high chance of a disease causing 
mutation (   ) and in the rest of the (     ) space we have no data so we are uncertain. 
In order to have a clearer picture of the local variation of the data we also analysed the points 
around (     )  (   ) by plotting the same probability density functions in the right half 
of the figure for the data sample with            and            . There are important 
findings from the three surface plots from the right side of the figure: the probability density 
functions are not smooth in the region and the more we zoom in on the point (     )  
(   ) the more we see that there is an extremely high probability of having a disease causing 
mutation  (   ) in a very small region around that point. This already gives us direction for 
the next steps of our analysis. First, we should use very fine gridding of the data as there is a 
lot of information in small regions. Second, when we build a classifier we need a function 
with many degrees of freedom as opposed to a very simple function which could not capture 
the detailed variation in the data. 
At this step of the analysis we observed that the difference between the empirical distribution 
functions that we presented can by itself already act as a classifier. The classifier scoring 
function would be    (     )     ?   (     )     ?   (     )  where the hat 
symbolizes the estimate of the probability density function. The threshold of the classifier 
would be zero therefore the classifier will predict disease (   ) if   (     )    and it 
will predict polymorphism if (   ) if    (     )   . 
32 
 
Figure 8-4 Empirical probability density functions for the case where the amino acid window is equal to one. The   axis 
corresponds to the wild disorder score    , the   axis corresponds to the mutated disorder score     and the   axis 
corresponds to the empirical probability density function     (     ). The left half of the figure corresponds to the data 
sample with         ,          , and the right half of the figure corresponds to the data sample with           ,  
          . The first row in the figure corresponds to the data sample with proteins classified as diseased (   ), the 
second row corresponds to the data sample with proteins classified as polymorphisms (    ), and the third row 
corresponds to the difference between the two probability density functions       (     )        (     ) . The 
empirical probability density functions are obtained by dividing the instances into a grid of size       
(                ,                 ), counting the instances inside each grid element and then dividing all the 
counts to the sum of all counts obtaining probabilities. 
8.3.1 Interpolation and smoothing 
In this subsection we will introduce the techniques that we used to estimate a continuous 
scoring function which can be used for classifying new data points. 
33 
We now have a first idea of a classifier inspired directly from a detailed analysis of the data. 
In order to classify new points we need to use a variation on interpolation. We decided to use 
linear interpolation as a first trial version. Figure 8-5 displays the    
 
(     )  scoring 
function which was estimated on a grid of         and then linearly interpolated. You can 
easily observe the high confidence close to the extreme values of (     ) that the instances 
will be classified as disease (   
 
(     )    and    
 
(     )   ). 
 
Figure 8-5 The first scoring function for predicting disease. We estimated a continuous scoring function    
 (     ) by 
simple linear interpolation such that we could classify points which were not exactly on the grid. 
We could use only the interpolated version of our scoring function, which would probably 
give good forecasting results, but that is not a good idea if we want to extract the main 
features of the data in order to draw more general conclusions.  
At the same time a smoother scoring function would give better results when testing its 
forecasting accuracy on new data. During the process of working for this thesis we 
experimented with multiple methods for generating a smoother scoring function. We started 
with nonparametric models like scatter plot smoothing techniques (locally weighted scatter 
plot smoothing or LOWESS), but the disadvantage was that it did not behave well along the 
edges of the areas where we had no observations. Another method that we tried was 
Multivariate adaptive regression splines, but again this type of dataset was not regular enough 
for the method to work well. Other methods that we tried were linear regression and logistic 
regression but the problem with these types of models is that they have too few parameters to 
be able to capture the variations of our dataset.  
Despite being unsuccessful with those methods we were however successful in fitting splines. 
This method has many features which were very advantageous to our project: they are flexible 
enough to include detailed variation in the dataset but at the same time their smoothness can 
be controlled according to our preference for generality over specificity of our model. We 
experimented with a few spline fitting approaches, including the ones already included in 
MATLAB like spaps.m which is based on (Reinsch n.d.). 
Nevertheless, the best method for our purposes was based on (Garcia 2010). We also used the 
implementation of the spline fitting algorithm from the same paper. The main features of the 
algorithm that were very useful to us were the fact that it could iterate until it found the best 
smoothing parameter by minimizing the generalized cross-validation score, and that we could 
give higher weights to points that had higher density. In order to fit the spline surfaces we 
34 
applied the algorithm to the uniformly sampled data points obtained by calculating the 
frequencies in each element of a         grid of the (     ) space. 
We used the spline fitting with two different types of parameterisations. First, we fitted a 
spline surface with a smoothing parameter   which minimized the generalized cross 
validation criterion:          (        ( )) . Second, we fitted a spline surface by 
giving a higher weight to points in the grid which were calculated using a larger sample (the 
weight was equal to the sum of the empirical probability density functions for the disease and 
polymorphisms:  (     )        (     )        (     )). 
The first case, without the weights is displayed in Figure 8-6. It is evident that the surface is 
much smoother than in Figure 8-5 and better summarizes the main features of the data. 
 
Figure 8-6 The first scoring function for predicting disease. We estimated a continuous scoring function    
 (     ) by 
fitting a spline surface with a smoothing parameter         which minimized the generalized cross validation criterion: 
         (        ( )). The minimized GCVscore was equal to 5e-8. 
The second case, with the weighting is displayed in Figure 8-7. This surface is the smoothest 
out of the three, having fewer degrees of freedom. It also has a higher prediction accuracy for 
new data points as measured by the smaller generalized cross validation score than in Figure 
8-6 (GCVscore = 2e-8 versus 5e-8) which is perfectly in line with OccamÕs Razor principle. 
The main conclusion that we can draw from the figure is that disease is predicted in the 
corners:    
  
(     )    and    
  
(     )   .

giving a higher weight to points in the grid which were calculated using a larger sample (the weight was equal to the sum of 
the empirical probability density functions for the disease and polymorphisms: (     )        (     )  
      (     )). The result is a much smoother surface, with fewer degrees of freedom, which has a higher prediction 
accuracy for new data points as measured by the smaller GCVscore than in Figure 8-6 which is perfectly in line with 
OccamÕs razor principle. 
8.4 The second classifier: average of class labels 
In this section we will explain how we arrived at our second classifier    (     ). We will 
again use interpolation (    
 
(     ))  and spline surface fitting (    
 
(     )  and 
   
  
(     )) in order to be able to classify new data which is not directly overlapping the 
grid points. 
We start by viewing the data in a different way. In the previous section the value of the 
disease score    (     ) depended on the distribution of the whole data set as we were 
calculating the difference between two probability density functions of the data. Now we will 
look at the average of the class labels  (     ) inside each grid element. This value will be 
always between zero and one and the uncertainty threshold will be equal to 0.5. Therefore our 
second disease score will classify an instance as being disease if    (     )      and not 
disease (polymorphism) if    (     )     . 
Figure 8-8 displays three heat maps. The one on top plot the average of the disease label 
 (     ) for each grid element, versus the wild disease score    and the mutated disease 
score   . For our purposes we had to fill in the grid elements where we had no counts 
therefore we decided to set the values to 0.5 which is equal to the uncertainty threshold. This 
detailed heat map is color coded such that the grid elements which contain only diseased 
instances appear as red and the ones which contain only no disease (only polymorphism) 
instances appear as blue. This type of scoring provides more variation as due to the 
independent treatment of each grid element region we can have cases where a blue square 
appears right next to a blue square. The main features evident from this heat map are that 
proportionally there are more disease instances close to the origin (   (         )     ) 
and more polymorphisms close to the disordered area (   (         )     ). At the same 
36 
time the diseased proteins are most present where there is a strong change in the disorder after 
the mutation: maximum    (     ). We will use these values as a basis for our second 
disease scoring function. We now go on to analyze the other two plots. The heat map in the 
bottom left plots a measure of the counts of the disease instances inside each grid element. For 
display purposes, the actual color code is calculated as      (      ), where      is the 
number of disease instances inside that grid element. We used the log function due to the fact 
that there is exponential variation between the counts and we added the one so we do not end 
up with      ( )     . As a consequence the grid points with counts equal to zero will 
have the value 0 displayed on the color map legend and will have the color blue. The 
conclusions from the bottom left plot is that there are an extremely large number of disease 
proteins at (     )  (   ) and (     )  (   ) and a large number of disease proteins in 
the region (             ) while there are large regions (colored in blue) which contain 
no data. The subplot on the bottom right is built exactly in the same way except for the fact 
that it displays polymorphism (no disease) counts. The conclusions are that the 
polymorphisms are distributed in a similar way but are more evenly spread out. We will use 
these counts presented in the bottom two graphs for weighting the spline fit to the disease 
label average matrix (for obtaining the estimate of    
  
(     )).

the counts of the disease instances inside each grid element. For display purposes, the actual color code is calculated as

to zero will have the value 0 displayed on the color map legend and will have the color blue. Bottom right: heat map built 
exactly in the same way as the one in the bottom left except for the fact that it displays polymorphism (no disease) counts.

8.4.1 Interpolation and smoothing 
In this section exactly as in section 8.4.1 we will use interpolation (to obtain    
 
(     )) and 
spline surface fitting (to obtain    
 
(     ) and    
  
(     )) in order to be able to classify 
new data which is not directly overlapping with the grid points. 
Figure 8-9 displays the    
 
(     )  scoring function which was estimated on a grid of 
        points and then linearly interpolated. Here we can observe that although on average 
we can see similarities with the first scoring function, the surface is extremely noisy because 
we make the calculations inside each grid element independently from the other regions of the 
(     ) space. This surface is very likely to be over fitted which can lead to very poor out of 
sample performance of the classifier. We proceed to fit a smoother surface with fewer degrees 
of freedom. 
 
Figure 8-9 The second scoring function for predicting disease. We estimated a continuous scoring function    
 (     ) by 
simple linear interpolation such that we could classify points which were not exactly on the grid. 
We again used the spline fitting algorithm published by (Garcia 2010) with two different 
types of parameterisations. First we fitted a spline surface with a smoothing parameter   
which minimized the generalized cross validation criterion:          (        ( )) . 
Second we also included a weight for each point (equal to the sum of the grid counts for the 
disease and polymorphisms: (     )      (     )      (     )). 
The first case, without the weights is displayed in Figure 8-10. It is evident that the surface is 
much smoother than in Figure 8-9 and better summarizes the main features of the data. We 
see that this function will classify instances as being disease mainly if they are on the edges of 
the area where our data is situated and it will classify as polymorphism (not disease)  the data 
is situated towards the centre, close to the main diagonal of the (     ) space. We see very 
high confidence in disease in the area of small    and very small   . This can be interpreted 
as: disease is found where the change in disorder scores after a mutation is highest, or 
(     )             (   (     )). 
39 
 
Figure 8-10 The second scoring function for predicting disease. We estimated a continuous scoring function    
 (     ) by 
fitting a spline surface with a smoothing parameter        which minimized the generalized cross validation criterion: 
         (        ( )). The minimized GCVscore was equal to 0.014. 
Our last formulation, with the weighting is displayed in Figure 8-11. This surface is the 
smoothest out of the last three, having fewer degrees of freedom. It also has a higher 
prediction accuracy for new data points as measured by the smaller generalized cross 
validation score than the case presented in Figure 8-10 (GCVscore = 3e-5 versus 0.014) 
which is perfectly in line with OccamÕs Razor principle. The main conclusion that we can 
draw from the figure is that disease is predicted towards the (   ) corner:    
  
(        
 )    and polymorphisms are predicted close to the (   ) corner:    
  
(         )   . 
 
Figure 8-11 The second scoring function for predicting disease. We estimated a continuous scoring function    
  (     ) 
by fitting a spline surface with a smoothing parameter       which minimized the generalized cross validation criterion: 
         (        ( )). The minimized GCVscore was equal to 3e-5. The smoothing was carried out in this case by 
giving a higher weight to points in the grid which were calculated using a larger sample (the weight was equal to the sum of 
the grid counts for the disease and polymorphisms:  (     )      (     )      (     )). The result is a much 
smoother surface, with fewer degrees of freedom, which has a higher prediction accuracy for new data points as measured 
by the smaller GCVscore than in Figure 8-10 which is perfectly in line with OccamÕs razor principle.

8.5 Conclusion 
Via this thorough statistical analysis we have managed to answer to our first research 
questions which concentrated on identifying the level of disorder within our dataset; the 
disorder-to-order and order-to-disorder transitions and whether missense mutations are more 
prone to fall within disordered regions or not. The tables in section 8.1 give an exact overview 
of the level of disorder within the dataset based on an amino acid window of 1, 11 and 21 
residues. The scatter plots in section 8.2 graphically show that disorder to order transitions are 
more frequent and that the dataset is symmetrical in the levels of deleterious mutations (we 
can see throughout all the graphical analysis that there are two major clusters of disease 
mutations, one within structured proteins and one within disordered ones). This concludes that 
disorder is conserved within the dataset, meaning that mutations that happen to fall within 
disordered regions can sometimes be conserved across species.

9 Results 
Even though our main purpose was not to design and implement the best predictor for disease, 
we do want to establish whether there is a relationship between wild disorder scores, mutated 
disorder scores and the occurrence of disease. To achieve our main goal we tested several 
scoring functions that have as factors the wild and mutated disorder scores. To be able to 
make a high quality inference based on the data we would prefer a smooth model with as few 
parameters as possible which also matches the data well. Therefore our focus in this chapter 
will be to select out of the best performing predictors the one that would allow us to make the 
most intuitive inference on the relationship between the variables. The smoothed versions of 
classifiers one and two are already good candidates that we had in mind and presented earlier. 
However, we will give all the methods an equal chance and we will build a ROC curve for 
each of them. The main performance indicator that we will use to compare all the models is 
the area under the ROC curve.  
We will now give a concise description of a selection of all the models which we tried that 
have good enough performance to be presented in this thesis. We will use the same order in 
our presentation as in Table 9-1:

Table 9-1 Area under the ROC curve for each disease score 
The conclusion from Table 9-1 is that we can already cross out the scoring functions three to 
eight. These scoring functions have too few degrees of freedom to capture the complex 
interactions between the variables; this would explain the very low AUC. We therefore 
concentrate only on the first and second classifiers. 
Based on the above decision, we further show the ROC curves only for classifiers one and 
two. Figure 9-1 displays the ROC curves for the amino acid window size equal to one. We 
first notice that the curve is convex so we do not need to operate any classifier on the convex 
hull. We also notice that there is no intersection with the random line so we do not need to 
build a hybrid classifier (like we would have had to do had we used the scoring functions 
from 3 to 8). However there is potential for combining the classifiers for achieving maximum 
performance by using Scott's maximum realisable ROC but that is outside the scope of this 
thesis. It is evident from the plot that the six versions of the first two classifiers have a very 
similar performance.  
We do observe that our classifier of choice for this thesis   ? 
 (     ) performed reasonably 
well compared to the other classifiers while providing valuable insight into the complex 
interactions between the variables.

Now if we look at the results for the amino acid windows of 11 and 21 from Figure 9-2 and 
Figure 9-3 we can reach similar conclusions. This is to be expected as the disorder scores in 
all cases are quite similar.

window of 21 amino acids because it performed reasonably well compared to the other 
classifiers in terms of area under the ROC curve and generalized cross-validation score while 
providing valuable insight into the complex interactions between the variables.

We again present in Figure 9-4 the second classifier fitted with splines without weights, 
  ? 
 (     ) viewed from the top in order to better analyse its results. 
 
 
Figure 9-4 The second scoring function for predicting disease. We estimated a continuous scoring function    
 (     ) by 
fitting a spline surface with a smoothing parameter        which minimized the generalized cross validation criterion: 
         (        ( )). The minimized GCVscore was equal to 0.014. 
 
In conclusion we would like to point out that the two classifiers that we gave implemented 
have yet to be tested on a dataset of point mutations with the scope of measuring the degree of 
pathogenicity within disordered regions. The results are consistent with our hypothesis and as 
can be seen from figure 9.4, a smoothed scoring function performs better than a raw one 
simply because it allows for more degrees of freedom for capturing the data.

10 Critical evaluation 
From an overall perspective, this project had to first investigate the link between disease and 
mutations within intrinsic disorder and second to develop a straightforward classifier based on 
one feature that measured the degree of disorder change brought by these point mutations. We 
strongly believe that these aims were achieved via 4 major objectives as follows. 
First of all, this project needed extensive understanding of the bioinformatics field for its 
success. The first objective was to get acquainted with the concept of intrinsically disordered 
proteins and assess the bioinformatics tools available for detecting these sorts of proteins in 
nature. We believe this first objective has been successfully achieved offering a balanced, self 
standing review of the extant literature on intrinsic disorder and disease. 
The second objective was to conduct a statistical analysis on the dataset chosen. The available 
literature that dabbed into the problem we were trying to assess did not offer a proper 
comparison of the tools utilized. The biggest challenge was to determine how to effectively 
assess the relationship between disorder and disease and test its significance. A large 
proportion of the time was spent understanding and plotting the data. After a few failed 
attempts based on the direct correlation analysis of the wild-type and mutated type disorder 
scores we decided that a more in-depth approach is required; the results we first obtained 
indicated that the more disordered the protein the less susceptible to disease it was; this 
outcome is blatantly against what academia have presented. Thus, we were adamant that there 
is causality between mutations within disorder and human disease. We shifted our classical 
statistical approach from the traditional methods (linear regression and Pearson Correlation 
matrix which would not work given the nature of the data available) of assessing the 
dependencies between our variables and shifted our attention towards more complex 
measurements of variable dependencies. The first classifier we adopted was concentrated on 
probability density functions and the second used the averages of the disease class labels. 
Our third objective was to fit a classifier to our dataset. The focus was not necessarily on 
prediction performance but on being able to identify the nature of the relationship between 
disorder scores of the wind and mutated variants and the disease classification. We achieved 
this objective by using the two classifiers mentioned above. In order to estimate the disease 
scoring function we first used the classifiers in their original form by linear interpolation. The 
second approach was to fit splines and the third approach was to fit weighted splines. The 
results were satisfactory as the splines were able to capture the complex interactions between 
the variables. The classifier based on averages of disease labels and unweighted splines was 
our final choice as a good prediction performer and also giving us a good interpretation of the 
relationship between the data. We believe we have succeeded in achieving this objective also. 
Given the limited timeframe available for answering our research question, a few interesting 
approaches could not be trialled and implemented. This was due to not the most efficient time 
management, as more time than first envisaged was spent on analysing the data. However, we 
have compiled a set of further research options to improve our project.  
Overall we have answered our research question; we have applied statistical analysis tools 
that have yet to be tested on disordered proteins although they are widely used within the 
bioinformatics field. The classifiers designed have some predictive power reinforcing our 
hypothesis. 
46 
11 Further research 
Being such a new research field, there are plenty of other avenues that can be taken in order to 
improve the outcome of the research. Each of the following approaches includes a higher 
degree of biological information needed to infer strong enough findings. In this section we 
will attempt to explain further ideas worth exploring. 
1. Different disorder predictors. Given that the plethora of available disorder predictors 
uses different features depending on the research group that developed them, it would 
be an interesting sideÐproject to test a series of known well performing disorder 
predictors on the statistical framework we have developed. Based on a ranking system 
we could determine which disorder predictors work best with the task of identifying 
disease causing missense mutations. In this paper we have selected the top three 
predictors that output an individual score for each residue. We chose the simplest and 
computationally fastest predictor to incorporate from an implementation view. 
However, testing more predictors built on different features of intrinsic disorder we 
can gain more comprehensive understanding of the sequence features or structure 
properties of such proteins. 
2. Gene Ontology terms. Genes are units of heredity passed from a parent to an 
offspring; they are short segments of DNA which code for a certain type of protein. 
Gene ontology is a bioinformatics initiative to help unify gene related information 
(gene representation and gene product or proteins and RNA attributes) across all 
species. Just like for intrinsically disordered proteins, there is not a standardized 
nomenclature describing genes and gene product attributes. This project can be further 
enriched if given the list of gene ontology disease terms found in the SUPERFAMILY 
database and the list of disease causing mutations that were correctly identified by our 
classifier, map them together based on disease and function and compute the statistical 
significance (after normalization) for each of them. This, in essence would be a purely 
biological task that would identify which diseases are linked to which IDP function. 
This task will be further pursued with the aim of getting the paper published, however 
for our central task this has limited computer science power.   
3. Extend the research question to include binding sites. Another research question that 
is adjacent to our project would be to verify the impact mutations within binding sites 
of disordered regions have based on the amino acid sequence. Binding sites function 
via a disorder to order transition caused by binding to a globular partner. This 
assumption is very probable given the nature of disordered proteins that are highly 
promiscuous and flexible. The authors of IUPred extended their research into the 
binding sites and created the ANCHOR predictor which aims at identifying portions 
within disordered regions that cannot form enough favourable intra-chain interactions, 
but do have the energetic capability of gaining such interactions when binding to 
globular protein partners (Doszt‡nyi et al. 2009). Cancer is one of the diseases where 
protein-protein interactions and binding sites have often been linked. Corroborating 
this information with disease-causing mutations makes for an interesting new project. 
However, this is beyond the scope of our project since we are trying to prove a 
generalized causality between disease and mutations in disordered region. Neverteless, 
(Pajkos et al. 2012) have investigated the causality between protein disorder and the 
increased biological risk in terms of cancer-associated point mutations. Their findings 
include that genetic mutations have a functional impact on both structured and 
intrinsically disordered proteins, however in different ways. This conclusion can only 
reinforce ours.  
47 
4. Implement classifier within the FATHMM software. Functional Analysis Through 
Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM) is a University of Bristol in house mutation 
predictor constructed for the SUPERFAMILY pipeline. The procedure of predicting 
the functional consequences of point mutations concentrates on building a HMM 
model for the query sequence in order to identify its homologues. Then, the amino 
acid probabilities within the HMM are interrogated and if there is a reduction in the 
difference between the wild-type and the mutant residue then the assumption is that 
the point mutation can have a negative functional impact (Edwards et al. n.d.). A 
further enhancement of out project would be to incorporate the classifier developed 
here within the FATHMM framework and verify if the predicted results improve 
(even by a small percentage) that of FATHMM. This extra task is mostly an 
implementation task and the rate of success is not guaranteed. Moreover, we decided 
that the time spent on integrating the codes is better spent in answering our research 
questions to the fullest. 
We have presented 4 major directions for further research that can improve the findings of 
this project. 
48 
12 Conclusion 
Through this paper we have provided a framework for analysing an interesting and novel 
factor of intrinsically disordered proteins. We have started by offering an extensive 
background on the biological implications of these proteins and the mutations they include. 
We later tested the working hypothesis that mutations within disordered regions are 
deleterious on a non-redundant, highly annotated dataset. We adopted a novel approach to the 
statistical analysis of the data and designed a classifier that was in line with the research 
question. There is now scope for the scientific field to further research other avenues into 
identifying as soon as possible the deleterious mutations that cause serious human diseases.
