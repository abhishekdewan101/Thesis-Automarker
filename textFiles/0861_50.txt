Summary 
The project is about a new hypothesis: soft graph colouring can be done by finding 
communities in the complement graph. The aim of this project is to test the 
hypothesis on unweighted graphs. Various community detection algorithms will be 
tested on the complement graph, and evaluated according to how well the colouring 
constrains in the original graph are preserved.

1. Introduction 
Graph colouring algorithms are widely used for solving scheduling and resource 
allocation problems. Hard graph colouring is the traditional graph colouring and 
colour all the vertices in a graph with no two adjacent vertices have the same colour. 
Using the method of cliques-finding algorithm can approximate associate the 
problem of hard graph colouring, which is a NP hard. In soft graph colouring, a pair of 
vertices connected by an edge may be given the same colour, but the number of such 
edges is minimized.  
 
As is well known to all, simple graph colouring is equivalent to finding cliques in the 
complement graph. We believe that soft graph colouring can be done by finding 
communities in the complement graph. Detecting communities in graphs is to 
identify the modules and the hierarchical organization, by only using the information 
encoded in the graph topology. The problem has a long tradition and there are 
hundreds of community detection (CD) algorithms. [1] 
 
The aim of this project is to test the hypothesis on unweighted graphs. Various 
community detection algorithms will be tested on the complement graph, and 
evaluated according to how well the colouring constrains in the original graph are 
preserved. The process of the project has four steps. First of all, renew the original 
network to the complement graph. Secondly, find communities by community 
detection algorithms in the complement graph. Next, transform the communities to 
the colours. Finally, evaluate the result according to the conflict edges. 
 
In this report I try to cover in some detail the work done in the project. The report 
can be divided into six parts. Part two show all the networks in this project, with 
descriptions in detail, illustrating the original graph and complement. Next, 
experiments for small graphs are shown in part three, while part four analyzes the 
experiments for the large network. Those two parts have an explanation for the 
community detection algorithms, and show examples and results of each experiment. 
Evaluation of the results is in part five. The final part is conclusion for the whole 
project.

2. Networks 
Before I begin the experiments, it is important to find some example problems, and 
then start using the proposed method to solve them. Those example problems are 
some networks that need to be coloured using soft graph colouring.  
 
2.1 Six graphs 
Those might be for some scheduling problem like scheduling exams, in which case 
the vertices represent exams and the edges represent the fact that two exams are 
taken by the same students. That is the reason I created six graphs (graph 0 to graph 
5) based on the 2010 MSc timetable of computer science department [4]. Those 
small graphs are good to test CD algorithms at first.

Figure 6: Graph 0 
 
Next, it is good to know the number of hard graph colouring for each graph. In hard 
graph colouring (HGC), two vertices shared one edge must be given different colours. 
For the whole graph, make the number of colours as minimized as possible. All the 
six graphs can be HGC by 5 colours. I believe that five is the minimum colours of HGC 
for each graph, but the figures under show only one case of five colours in the 
original graphs.

To transform the original graphs to the complement graphs, I wrote a simply program 
to do so. It shows all the edges in the complement graphs. The format of output file 
is: vertex1 tab vertex2

The table below shows the information of those graphs.

Table 1: Six graphs. The first column is ID number of each graph. Column two and 
three show the amount of vertices and edges in the original graphs, respectively. The 
fourth column means the number of edges in the complement graphs. Column five 
represents colours used for hard graph colouring. 
 
Another simple program is written to count conflict edges. If two vertices are given 
the same colour, in other words, the two vertices are both in one community, and 
then the edge between them is a conflict edge. As can be seen in figure 7 to 12, there 
are not any conflict edges in hard graph colouring. 
 
2.2 Large network 
It is easier to test CD algorithms using small examples like those. However, I need a 
large one. It should be a real network that needs colouring. E.g., a scheduling 
network or a register interference graph. It might be worth looking at a register 
allocation example. Soft graph colouring could be useful there, because there is only 
a fixed number of registers (colours) available.  
 
I found a large network named “inithx.i.1” from Ref. [5]. The network is based on 
register allocation for variables in real codes. It has 864 vertices and 18707 edges. 
The chromatic number is 54.

3. Experiments for small examples 
The main point of this project is experiments. To see if community detection 
algorithms can be used for soft graph colouring, and check how good the graph 
colouring results are. However, there are hundreds of algorithms. For my purposes, I 
do not need a fast one yet but it is good to have one that is tunable, because I want 
to be able to control the number of communities. The reason for choosing those 
algorithms below is they are tunable. 
 
3.1 GN algorithm experiments 
3.1.1 GN algorithm 
The algorithm of Girvan and Newman (GN) is a popular way to detect communities in 
graphs by finding the edges that connect vertices of different communities and 
eliminate them. That makes the clusters get separated from each other. One 
important point is to focus on the attributes of those edges and easy to detection. [1] 
 
This is a good example to show intercommunity edge. 
Figure 13: GN algorithm. The 
picture of community detection in 
graphs of Santo Fortunato is copied 
from Ref. [1]. 
 
 
 
The steps of GN algorithm can be listed as follow: 
1. Estimation of the importance of all edges by their attributes; 
2. Eliminate the most important edge; 
3. Recomputation of the importance for the rest edges; 
4. Repeat step 2. [1] 
 
3.1.2 GN algorithm for soft graph colouring 
I found a program named “CONGA/CONGO/Peacock Software” from Ref. [6], and 
tested the six graphs (I mentioned before) by GN algorithm. 
 
The steps of the experiment are: 
Step 1: run the software and find four communities in the complement graph 
Step 2: identify conflict edges in each community 
Step 3: count the number of conflict edges 
I did the three steps for each graph by GN algorithm. 
 
3.1.2.1 Example one 
Step 1: the communities are: 
cg cr is

c ml

Step 2: the conflict edge is CR-IS.

conflict edge. 
 
Step 3: the number of conflict edges is 1.

Step 3: the number of conflict edges is 43. 
 
3.1.3 Summary for GN algorithm 
All the results of GN algorithm can be listed as follow: 
ID Vertices Edges Hard graph colouring (HGC) Conflict edges 
0 25 61 5 43 
1 16 39 5 13 
2 13 33 5 10 
3 13 33 5 10 
21 
 
4 10 27 5 4 
5 7 16 5 1 
Table 2: Results of GN algorithm. The first column is ID number of each graph. 
Column two and three show the amount of vertices and edges in the graphs, 
respectively. The fourth column means the number of colours used for hard graph 
colouring. Column five shows the amount of conflict edges when I use 4 colours. 
 
As can be seen from this table, the number of conflict edges is increased by vertices 
addition. In graph 0, there are 43 conflicts, which is 70% of total edges. It seems that 
GN algorithm is not good at soft graph colouring. 
 
3.2 CM+BK algorithm experiments 
3.2.1 CM+BK algorithm 
The main idea of CM+BK algorithm is cliques merging and Bron Kerbosch (BK) 
algorithm. 
 
The steps of CM+BK algorithm can be listed as follow: 
1. Expand candidate cliques  
2. Output result if the algorithm find a clique 
3. Delete all vertices of the clique in data structures 
4. Repeat step 1 until the cliques are maximal [2] 
 
3.2.2 CM+BK algorithm for soft graph colouring 
I found a program named “CliqueMod Software” from Ref. [7], and tested the six 
graphs (I mentioned before) by CM+BK algorithm. 
 
The steps of the experiment are: 
Step 1: run the software and find four communities in the complement graph 
Step 2: identify conflict edges in each community 
Step 3: count the number of conflict edges 
I did the three steps for each graph by CM+BK algorithm.

Column two and three show the amount of vertices and edges in the graphs, 
respectively. The fourth column means the number of colours used for hard graph 
colouring. Column five shows the amount of conflict edges when I use 4 colours. 
 
It can be seen in the table, the number of conflict edges is fluctuated while the 
number of vertices is increased. There are only 5 conflicts in graph 0, which has 61 
edges in all. CM+BK algorithm is much better than GN algorithm. 
 
3.3 CM+KJ algorithm experiments 
3.3.1 CM+KJ algorithm 
The main idea of CM+KJ algorithm is cliques merging and Konc Janezic (KJ) algorithm. 
The change of KJ algorithm is about upper bound. When invoking KJ algorithm again, 
CM+KJ algorithm use the size of the last clique found as an upper bound on the 
clique size. [2] 
 
3.3.2 CM+KJ algorithm for soft graph colouring 
I found a program named “CliqueMod Software” from Ref. [7], and tested the six 
graphs (I mentioned before) by CM+KJ algorithm. 
 
The steps of the experiment are: 
Step 1: run the software and find four communities in the complement graph 
Step 2: identify conflict edges in each community 
Step 3: count the number of conflict edges 
I did the three steps for each graph by CM+KJ algorithm.

Table 4: Results of CM+KJ algorithm. The first column is ID number of each graph. 
Column two and three show the amount of vertices and edges in the graphs, 
respectively. The fourth column means the number of colours used for hard graph 
colouring. Column five shows the amount of conflict edges when I use 4 colours. 
 
As can be seen from this table, the number of conflict edges is increased by vertices 
addition. In graph 0, there are 23 conflicts, which are fewer than 43 conflict edges of 
GN algorithm. However, it is worse than CM+BK algorithm. 
 
3.4 CNM algorithm experiments 
3.4.1 CNM algorithm 
31 
 
Newman and Girvan essay to estimate the value of graph clustering by means of 
modularity. CNM (Clauset, Newman, and Moore) algorithm is a bottom-up 
agglomerative clustering which continuously identifies and merges pairs of clusters 
attempting to maximize modularity of the community structure in a greedy manner. 
[3] 
 
3.4.2 CNM algorithm for soft graph colouring 
I found a program named “Fast Modularity” from Ref. [8], and tested the six graphs (I 
mentioned before) by CNM algorithm. 
 
The steps of the experiment are: 
Step 1: run the software and find four communities in the complement graph 
Step 2: transform the numeric vertices to the original vertices. 
Step 3: identify conflict edges in each community 
Step 4: count the number of conflict edges 
I did the four steps for each graph by CNM algorithm.

3.5 Walktrap algorithm experiments 
3.5.1 Walktrap algorithm 
The idea of walktrap algorithm is that a random walker tends to be trapped in the 
same community. It tries to find communities in a graph by random walks. 
 
3.5.2 Walktrap algorithm for soft graph colouring 
I found a program named “Walktrap v0.2” from Steve, and tested the six graphs (I 
mentioned before) by Walktrap algorithm. 
 
The steps of the experiment are: 
Step 1: run the software and find four communities in the complement graph 
Step 2: transform the numeric vertices to the original vertices. 
Step 3: identify conflict edges in each community 
Step 4: count the number of conflict edges 
I did the four steps for each graph by Walktrap algorithm.

Table 6: Results of Walktrap algorithm. The first column is ID number of each graph. 
Column two and three show the amount of vertices and edges in the graphs, 
respectively. The fourth column means the number of colours used for hard graph 
colouring. Column five shows the amount of conflict edges when I use 4 colours. 
 
As can be seen in this table, the number of conflict edges is increased by vertices 
addition. In graph 0, there are 41 conflicts, which is over half of the edges in the 
graph. Walktrap algorithm is worse than CM+BK, CM+KJ, and CNM algorithm.

4. Experiment for a large network 
After testing six graphs, I try the large network by those algorithms. The large 
network has 864 vertices and 18707 edges. After transforming it to the complement 
graph, it has 354109 edges. For each algorithm, I randomly pick some integers as 
communities, and test the conflict edges with those communities. Unfortunately, GN 
algorithm is very slow to run the large graph, and I have to move on to others.  
 
4.1 CM+BK algorithm experiments 
The data of CM+BK algorithm can be listed as follow: 
Communities 2 3 4 5 10 15 25 32 53 54 64 
Conflicts 4566 4540 4520 4488 4406 4346 4246 4198 4121 4120 4094 
Table 7: Results of BK algorithm for the large network. The first row is the number of 
communities input in the program. Row two shows the amount of conflict edges with 
those communities. 
 
I use the results to generate a curve: 
 
Figure 44: The figure is based on the results of table 6. The x axis is the number of 
communities, while the y axis is the number of conflict edges. 
 
From the figure, it can be shown that the curve reduced gradually. The conflicts are

Table 8: Results of KJ algorithm for the large network. The first column is the number 
of communities input in the program. Column two shows the amount of conflict 
edges with those communities. 
 
I use the results to generate a curve: 
 
Figure 45: The figure is based on the results of table 7. The x axis is the number of 
communities, while the y axis is the number of conflict edges. 
 
As can be seen from this figure, the curve leveled off at first, and then declined 
steadily. The whole curve is better than CM+BK algorithm, because the numbers of 
conflicts are fewer than those. 
 
4.3 Walktrap algorithm experiments 
The data of Walktrap algorithm can be listed as follow:

Table 9: Results of Walktrap algorithm for the large network. The first column is the 
number of communities input in the program. Column two shows the amount of 
conflict edges with those communities. 
 
I use the results to generate a curve: 
 
Figure 46: The figure is based on the results of table 8. The x axis is the number of 
communities, while the y axis is the number of conflict edges. 
 
There is a dramatic reduction of Walktrap curve from communities 2 to communities 
4. The rest of the curve reduced steadily, and is better than CM+BK and CM+KJ 
algorithms.

Figure 47: The figure is based on the results of table 9. The x axis is the number of 
communities, while the y axis is the number of conflict edges. 
 
From the figure, it may be seen that the curve decreased gradually. The conflicts are 
over 1400 from communities 2 to communities 64. The result is worse than the curve 
of Walktrap algorithm.

5. Evaluation 
The final part of the process is to evaluate the results according to conflict edges. It is 
important to know that which CD algorithm is the best. Moreover, does the best one 
work better than soft graph colouring algorithm? 
 
5.1 CD algorithms 
Although CM+BK algorithm gets good results for the six graphs, it does not work well 
for the large network. However, it is very useful to know which algorithm is best. 
 
Figure 48: The figure is based on the results BK, KJ, Walktrap and CNM. The x axis is 
the number of communities, while the y axis is the number of conflict edges. 
 
As can be shown from this figure, both Walktrap and CNM algorithm work well and 
get fewer conflicts. 
 
5.2 Soft graph colouring algorithm 
Another important thing is to find a soft graph colouring algorithm and compare 
them. There is an algorithm for soft graph colouring from Steve: To colour the 
network using c colours, use colours 1,  , c-1 for the c-1 for the c-1 largest cliques, 
and use colour c for the remaining (54-c+1) smallest cliques. 
 
The steps of the algorithm can be listed as follow: 
Step 1: compute complement network of the large graph. 
Step 2: find all maximal cliques in complement graph, in order of size. 
Step 3: Reduce the number of cliques by replacing the smallest cliques by one

“community” that contains all of them. 
Step 4: Evaluate the list of communities (actually one “community” and many cliques) 
in the usual way: count the number of conflicts. 
 
The smallest cliques have only one vertex, and they are:

I take those smallest cliques and combine them into one set. That gives 36 sets: 35 
cliques and one set of 19 vertices. Then count the conflicts in this. It is 85 conflict 
edges caused by grouping those 19 singletons into one set. Next, repeat step 2 to 
merge the last N cliques into one set, and count conflicts again. 
 
The results of this algorithm are:

Table 11: Results of soft graph colouring algorithm for the large network. The first 
column is the number of colours, in other words, the set after merging. Column two 
shows the amount of conflict edges with those colours. 
 
 
Figure 49: The figure is based on the results of table 10. The x axis is the number of 
communities, while the y axis is the number of conflict edges.

The figure below shows the curves of Walktrap algorithm and soft graph colouring 
algorithm. 
 
Figure 50: The figure is based on the results SGC and Walktrap algorithm. The x axis is 
the number of communities, while the y axis is the number of conflict edges. 
 
From the figure, it may be seen that the conflicts of Walktrap algorithm are more 
than the conflicts of SGC algorithm. Walktrap algorithm does not work well than SGC 
algorithm. 
 
5.3.2 CNM and SGC 
The figure below shows the curves of CNM algorithm and soft graph colouring 
algorithm. 
 
Figure 51: The figure is based on the results SGC and CNM algorithm. The x axis is the 
number of communities, while the y axis is the number of conflict edges. 
 
As can be seen from the figure, the curve of CNM keeps straight, while the curve of 
soft graph colouring algorithm decreased gradually. It looks like the CNM algorithm is 
better than SGC algorithm in the front of those curves.

All in all, the experiments test five community detection algorithms, and compare 
them with soft graph colouring algorithm. CNM algorithm is the best one in those 
five algorithms, and is better than soft graph colouring algorithm in some case.

6. Outlook  
Outlook part summarizes the whole project, and future work of it. 
 
6.1 Conclusion 
It is generally accepted that simple graph colouring is equivalent to finding cliques in 
the complement graph. This project tested a new hypothesis, which is soft graph 
colouring can be done by finding communities in the complement graphs.  
 
GN, CM+BK, CM+KJ, CNM, and Walktrap, five community detection algorithms are 
chosen to run experiments, because they are easy to control the number of 
communities. Seven graphs are tested in this project, and CNM algorithm works well 
in the large network. 
 
After comparing CNM algorithm with soft graph colouring algorithm, it can be 
concluded that CNM algorithm is better than soft graph colouring algorithm in some 
case. 
 
6.2 Future work 
The project can be extended in future. First and foremost, it can be tested in other 
unweighted large networks. Secondly, there are hundreds of community detection 
algorithms, and it is possible that other CD algorithm can do a better work than CNM 
algorithm. What is more, find other soft graph colouring algorithm, and compare 
them. Finally, the project can be further extended to weighted graphs. It is more 
important to use different colours for two vertices if they are connected by a high 
weight edge.
