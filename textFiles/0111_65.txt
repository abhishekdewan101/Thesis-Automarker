Abstract 
 
This piece of paper goes through the idea of image processing and pixel - based detection 
with background subtraction. A combination of the near-infrared technology and 
background subtraction technique is done, to solve the problem with the irritating 
projector light, which goes in the presenterÕs eyes during the presentation process. At 
first, to achieve the desired results the presenter is detected. Then, with a series of 
morphological filters a back solid mask, with the shape of the detected object is created. 
Furthermore, the mask applied to the next slide will be projected covering the presenterÕs 
eyes, preventing light to those points. Results shows that the project has managed to 
accomplish the objectives with a frame rate of approximately 18 frames per second, thus 
can be characterised as real time application. In addition, the object detection algorithm 
successfully detected 94% of the tested cases and cover mask has been produced.

41 Introduction 
 
This piece of work is an effort to examine the topic of ÔReal Ð time removing of 
foreground objects from projected sceneÕ. ?he aim of this project is to detect objects in 
front of a plane in real-time and to remove the information of their position from a 
projected scene. My interest in this subject emerged from the essential need of the 
lecturer to demonstrate the material of the subject having at the same time eye contact 
with the people that are listening. Another determining factor in my choice was my 
personal experience with a fellow student who had an Attention Deficit and 
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Based on his experience, the teaching method the 
lecturer used with a projector was distractive to him because he was unable to concentrate 
to the screen and to the lecturer simultaneously. People with ADHD are influenced from 
a variety of environmental factors [1]. Consequently, lecturers could reduce the 
possibility of interruption in several ways. In this specific case, the lecturer should not 
move far away from the screen, where the studentsÕ attention should focus on. Teaching 
methods that respond to all studentsÕ needs should be taken in consideration and be 
applied [2]. Furthermore, an essential factor for an effective teaching is the lecturer, who 
should have communicability and be able to transfer his interest for the subject to the 
students. This could be achieved with the teachersÕ eye contact towards the classroom 
[2]. This study is an effort to solve this issue, while a lecturer will be teaching next to the 
screen and have eye contact with the students individual. Last but not least, this technique 
will help more the non native language students who suppress more effort to understand 
because they are trying to focus on the lecturer and on the screen as well.    
How does object detection help the lecturer?  The theory behind the entire project 
is that, while the lecturer makes an effort to explain the projected slides, he needs to stand 
in front of the projector.  As a result, the annoying light beam from the projector goes 
directly to his eyes. Immediately, this results in a reaction to move to a position outside 
the projected image, disrupting studentsÕ attentiveness to the lecturer while they are 
trying to read on the screen. A solution to the problem is a series of steps which have to 
be completed. Firstly, the moving object has to be detected, which is the lecturer in this 
problem, and secondly, the projected information has to be removed to his place. To 
remove the light from the object position, black pixels will be used to cover the 
information of the slides. Removing that part of the slide does not have any influence on 
the studentsÕ learning process because that piece of information is not readable.  
 In the process of object detection, which the accuracy and the quality of results 
are critical factors to the entire project, to identify the background and foreground 
objects, techniques like background subtraction with pixel intensities and depth 
measurement could be used.  
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
5Background subtraction is a technique with quite simple theory that is widely 
used for pixel-based object detection applications. Nevertheless, its accuracy is 
proportional to illumination and motion changes. Different approaches based on the 
background subtraction technique exist which propose reliability and quality in solution. 
The main difference, is proposing an alternative way of how the calculation of the 
background model image or pattern must be and how this model is being updated with 
time. 
 Another way to determine whenever a point in an image is either foreground or 
background is by knowing how far from the viewer that point is. In contrast to 
background subtraction with pixel intensities, these techniques use the depth information 
to characterize each pixel and to create the background model. Stereo images captured 
from two or more cameras are used in these methods to provide the sample. With 
techniques similar to the way the human brain understands the 3D space, depth 
information is  extracted  from 2D images  Having the depth information of each point of 
the image, in foreground the points with less depth are nearer and the points with further 
depths are the background. This technique is used to eliminate problems that occur due to 
physical changes of the background, such as great illumination changes or noise created 
by camera movements. The background model is updated in most cases, like background 
subtraction with pixel intensities. 
Last but not least, all methods and techniques must be able to process on real time 
and to be implemented on standard existed hardware. Nowadays, technology evolution 
has lead to very fast computation speeds. Also, the design of hardware devices 
specializes for image processing applications, allows intensive computations to be 
performed in real time. Digital signal processors are a great example of high computation 
efficiency and low power consumption.  
The rest of the document is formatted as follows. In the introduction section a more 
detailed description of the problem is given. The second chapter describes the aim and 
objectives of the project, while in the theoretical background section more information 
can be found about the techniques that were used to achieve the solution. Moreover, the 
implementation of the project is explained in depth in the implementation section. The 
results are analysed and explained in tests and results chapter.  Next can be found an 
evaluation of the main objectives.  Finally, a conclusion section suggests any ways for 
further improvements.

62 Aim and Objectives 
2.1 Aim 
 
?he aim of this project is to detect objects in real-time in front of a plane, object position 
identification and adjustment  of the projected slides from a projector in order  to remove 
projected information to object position. As a result, the detected object would not have 
any light projected to it. 
 
2.2 List of Objectives 
 
The main objectives to achieve this desired result are: 
 
1. Study the appropriate object detection method to fulfill the problem requirements 
 
2. Define Background Ð Foreground Models 
 
3. Implementation of Background - Foreground models 
 
4. Implementation of object detection algorithm  
 
5. Test algorithm with different conditions 
 
6. Evaluation of the results obtained from objective 5, review methods 
 
7. Compose the real Ð time object detection system 
 
8. Final tests of the system 
 
The rest of this section briefly explains the main objective of the project and the work 
that has be done in each one in a few words. More detail evaluation of the objective can 
be found in Objectives Evaluation chapter 
 
2.2.1 Study the appropriate object detection method. 
 
The choice of the appropriate object detection method was critical for further 
implementation of the project. The hardware that was finally selected to work with was 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
7proportional to the method. The method used to detect objects was based on the 
environment where the project would run. Similar to any other applications the working 
environment must be studied for any special characteristics before the implementation of 
any algorithm. Likewise, for this project, the room environment was studied to obtain any 
helpful information about the light sources, the average distance between the projector 
and the lecturer and the position of the projector in the room.  
Moreover, the projector will operate at the same time with the object detection 
part of the system; therefore, its effects to the working environment were taken in 
account. The simultaneous projection of the scene over the object has as a result, 
morphological and illumination changes of the objects causing problems on correct 
detection. 
In addition, the aim of this project was not to implement a new object detection 
algorithm better than already existing ones, but to solve the problem with the disturbing 
light of the projector. The problem that tries to be solved by this project is frequent and 
until the time the projects began no solution have be found.  Thus, the final applications 
were implement and tested in terms of project aims. 
The outcome of this study has helped to understand more clearly the condition of 
the working environment and also, made the choice of the object detection algorithm 
much easier. From all the environment study outcomes and strictly the aim of the project, 
three methods have been selected to be compared. Basic Background Subtraction is the 
method chosen to be used to determine the background and foreground regions of a 
frame. Practically the new object in the scene does not need to be identified, but only 
locate its position in the frame. Hence, there is no need for further analyses of  
foreground region. This method was the most inexpensive and has the less process power 
in contrary with a 3D camera solution or a stereo vision solution. More on the object 
detection methods can be found in the Theoretical Background section.  
 
2.2.2 Define Background Ð Foreground Models 
 
The background model has a significant value to the operation of the object detection 
algorithm. Based on the object detection method, the background Ð foreground models 
were defined to meet the project needs. Moreover, in a background subtraction approach, 
the background model is a critical factor for the system reliability. 
Methods and functions that the system will distinguish between background and 
foreground, as well as how the background model will be updated, was defined in this 
process step. Additionally, the detected foreground region, which is everything on the 
frame that has not been classified as background, is the one that the system works with. 
The foreground is used for the creation of a dynamic mask that covers the object in the 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
8modified slide. Morphological filters are applied to the foreground to deal with image 
noises and are removed before it any other procedure.  
 
2.2.3 Implementation of Object Detection Algorithm  
 
This objective aims to implement the selected object detection algorithm. It requires 
being in real Ð time but for the initial implementation, still simple pictures were used.  
A high level language was used for the initial implementation of the algorithm, although 
the final form of the code is written in C using OpenCv library. In addition, in this 
implementation phase the background model and morphological filters were completed. 
This was the most time demanding step due to the large amount of function coding.  
 
2.2.4 Test Algorithm with Different Conditions 
 
This was the first testing step; the implemented algorithms were tested in a working 
environment with frames taken from simple camera and from the camera that was 
assembled for the purposes of the project.  Tests were performed in possible situations 
that could happen in the room environment such as illumination changes, second object 
in the vision range and objects with projected pattern on them.  The test results were very 
practical for the further improvement of the algorithm and the whole system. 
2.2.5 Compose Real Ð Time Object Detection System  
 
The combination of all the selected techniques and all the algorithms were done in this 
part of the progress. Furthermore, the first time that all the components of the system 
worked together was in this process step. For the purposes of this project, the hardware 
system that was selected to run the application were personal computers due to the fact 
that are mostly used in presentations. The use of personal computers for this project has 
also changed the specifications for the camera. The use of a USB camera was then more 
suitable, thus, it was more flexible than a camera with a specialized input cable. In 
addition, a simple portable projector was used. All the components of the system were 
worked simultaneously. The main elements of the system is the projector, the custom 
modified camera, the application and the personal computer as the processing unit.

92.2.6 Final Tests of the System  
 
The entire system was tested in order to fulfil the aims of this project. Real room 
environment was simulated to gather information about the functionality of the system. 
Testing was performed on people with different skin color to check that the system 
functions correctly to any skin colour and shade. Moreover, people wearing glasses were 
involved in testing. Glasses usually change the shape of the head and reflect light; hence 
the system was checked thoroughly in this kind of situations. Furthermore, tests were 
performed to show that the system works when the distance between the optical sensor 
and the screen is altered. Finally, the direction where the person is looking is also 
checked, to ensure that the system works with any angle or orientation of the personÕs 
head.

103 Theoretical Background  
 
3.1 Images 
 
In theory, we have a simple image with two dimensional functions where their values 
give the brightness of the image at any given point [3]. Digital images differ from a 
simple photograph in the x, y and f values which are distinct in digital images. A digital 
image can be considered as a large array of sampled points from the continuous image 
and each point has a specific quantized brightness. The points are called pixels and the 
surrounding pixels constitute a neighbourhood. An example of a neighbourhood is given 
in the figure below. If the number of columns and rows existing in a neighbourhood are 
of equal number, then it is crucial to provide which pixel in the neighbourhood is the 
current pixel. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Example of a digital image and neighborhood. 
 
There are four types of digital images; binary, greyscale, true colour or red-green-blue 
and indexed. In binary digital images, each pixel is composed of black and white. There 
are two possible values of pixels; 1(one) bit per pixel is needed. This kind of images is 
operative in terms of storage. They may also include text (printed or handwriting), 
fingerprints or architectural plans. Greyscale images include pixels that are a shade of 
grey, normally from 0 which corresponds to black colour, to 255 which is represented as 
white colour. The range states that each pixel can be represented by 8(eight) bits or 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
11exactly 1(one) byte. This is a very common range for image file handling such as image 
data indexing and processing, especially for applications designed to fit on digital signal 
processors. Greyscale images are mainly used in medicine (x-rays) and images of printed 
works as well as in the filed of image processing. Most of the image processing 
algorithms are using greyscale images. True colour image is the image where the pixel 
has a specific colour. The colour is described by the amount of red, green and blue colour 
in it. Such kind of image requires 24 bits for each pixel and thus, it is also named 24-bit 
colour image. Moreover, it may consist of a stack of three matrices, representing the red, 
green and blue values of a pixel having as a result the correspondence of three values in 
each pixel. Many of the colour images have a small subset of more than 16 million 
possible colours. In order to store and to handle them conveniently to the file, the image 
has a colour map or a colour palette which is a simple way to list the colours that are used 
in that image. Each pixel has a value but it does not give its colour, something that 
happens in red-green-blue, but it gives an index to the colour in the map. For this reason, 
these types of images are called indexed. 
 
3.1.1 Image Processing 
 
Image processing is the action through which an image is changed and moderated 
compared to the original.[3] 
 Nowadays, image processing is one of the most popular technological actions and 
there is almost no area of technological endeavour that is not influenced in some way by 
digital imaging. Some of the fields in which image processing is used are gamma-ray, X-
ray, imaging in the Ultraviolet Band, in the Visible and Infrared Band, the Microwave 
Band and imaging in the Radio Band. 
Image processing is divided into several steps through which each one should 
process the image in order to achieve the desirable result. The first step in image 
processing is the image acquisition which is considered simple because it is like an image 
being given in digital form. Image enhancement follows and it is the procedure of 
moderating an image in order to be more appropriate when compared to the first image 
and for a particular application. Another step is image restoration, which is also done for 
the improvement of an image. Then, we have colour image processing that is of great 
importance due to the fact that the images which are being processed are used very 
frequently in the internet. In addition, Wavelets are the foundation for representing 
images in various degrees of resolution. Compression, deals with techniques for reducing 
the storage required saving an image, or the bandwidth required transmitting it.  
 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
12Figure 2, shows the wide area of image processing. As an example, zooming in to 
an image is a result of several algorithms running on the background of an application. 
Information that was unobservable is readable after the process has been carried out. 
 
 
Figure 2: Example of image processing [4]. 
 
Morphological processing, on the other hand, has to do with tools which are used 
to extract image features and are useful to the representation and description of shape. 
Segmentation processes divide an image into component parts and/or objects. These 
procedures are classified into two different categories; autonomous segmentation and 
rugged segmentation. Autonomous segmentation is considered one of the most 
complicated tasks in the procedure of digital image processing. On the contrary, rugged 
segmentation is considered easier to be managed and in general makes the processing 
successful, especially when imaging problems are found. 
Digital image processing requires also representation and description. Both follow 
the performance of the segmentation. Representation is divided into two classes; firstly 
boundary representation and secondly regional representation. Boundary representation 
is suitable when the attention is on the external shape features like corners and 
inflections. On the contrary, regional representation handles with the internal properties, 
for instance, texture or skeletal shape. Description, which is also called feature selection, 
deals with extracting attributes that result in some quantitative information of interest or 
are basic for differentiating one class of objects from another. Finally, there is recognition 
which is the procedure which allocates a label to a specific object regarding the express 
of the descriptors. 
 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
133.2 Object Detection 
 
Object detection is considered one of the most essential processes in video analysis. It is 
associated with image processing and computer vision that aims to detect semantic 
objects in images and videos such as humans, cars or buildings the viewer is interested to 
analyse further. In most of the cases, moving objects are interesting and challenging 
while static parts are not. Thus, object detection can be considered as the detection of 
motion.  
Moreover, sophisticated algorithms were developed for object detection to achieve 
specific tasks like identifying faces [5], signs, speech or even the peopleÕs ethnicity, 
gender and age, while real Ð time tracking of moving objects seems to push several 
applications to the next level.  More than a few applications use object detection to 
maximize the accuracy of their outcome, while at the same time, others rely on their 
existence, including video surveillance and security systems. Since several algorithms 
and techniques were developed to match a specific application, frameworks come to put 
on a test the different aspects of each one [6 7].  
This project is directly connected to object detection and thus, the first step of the 
whole process, is to detect the object. The novelty of the system is that no other 
application has used object detection to solve problems that are similar to the one the 
project works on.   
 
3.3 Background Subtraction Techniques 
 
In most of the cases, the normal approach for detecting a moving object from a 
background scene is background subtraction. The background subtraction techniques and 
vision systems are linked together with the first being the pre-processing step for object 
detection and tracking. On one hand, results show that the existing algorithms are 
satisfied. On the other hand, a big amount of them are influenced by the global and local 
illumination changes and to be more specific, shadows and highlights are elements which 
can cause this consequences.  
The basic theory of background subtraction is to subtract the current frame or image 
from a background reference image. The fundamental steps of the algorithm are: 
 
? Background reference image creation. 
 
? Threshold selection, such as to obtain desired results. 
 
? Subtract the two images to find the moving objects. 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
14 
? Compare points of the new image with threshold to classify its state, background 
or foreground. 
 
? Apply morphological filtering to eliminate small regions and noise. 
 
After subtraction and thresholding steps, a new image is created containing information 
about moving or new objects. Therefore, results are taken in account to update the 
background reference picture and to segment, in most cases, foreground pixels into 
adjacent regions.  
The creation of the reference images is crucial, because the quality of algorithm 
results depends on that. Noise that is created by the camera movements, high alternations 
to density due to rapid illumination changes, weather condition and slow-moving or 
stopping objects can damage the background reference image. To deal with that, most 
methods computes the background reference image relying on statistical approaches, 
assuming that each point of the image is a random value and can be estimated using  
probability distribution based on information taken by previous images [8]. ÒPerson 
FinderÓ system use Gaussian distribution to define the background image. Mixture of 
Gaussian is also used to define the background image [9].

Figure 3 shows in a straightforward way how the background subtraction technique aids 
in object detection. This method assumes that the background is something known. The 
first part (a) shows the background reference picture. A new frame is shown in (b) and 
finally in (c) the foreground object is detected.

153.3.1 Basic Background Subtraction 
 
Basic background subtraction (BBS) is the simplest algorithm that can be used for object 
detection. By taking the absolute difference of the current frame and the background 
reference image and by comparing each pixel value with the threshold, it defines the 
foreground and background point on the frame. A point is classified as foreground if its 
pixel value is higher than the threshold value and vise versa for background. 
 
 |I (x,y) Ð B (x,y)| > T (2) 
t t
 
In formula 2 I (x,y) is a 3 x 1 vector showing the pixel value in time t for the current 
t
frame. B (x,y) is the pixel value from the background reference picture at the same 
t
position. T is the threshold value. B (x,y) is defined as the mean ( ?) computation from a 
t
series of N previous frames of pixel values for a certain position and this is the way that 
the background reference image is created each time. Thus, from equation 2 the new 
formula is:   
 
 |I (x,y) Ð ? (x,y)| > T (3) 
t t
 
This approach requires the need of huge memory resources.  Therefore, a method that 
defines the background reference image as the running average is introduced.   
 
 B (x,y) = ?* I (x,y) + (1 Ð ?) * B (x,y) (4) 
t+1 t t
 
Where ? is the learning rate. Thus, from equation 4 the background reference image is 
computed as the chronological pixel value average.  
Typically, ? is equal to0.05, so the new background reference image consists from 
5% of the new current frame to  95% of the old background reference image.  
Theoretically, after the computations, pixels in the image that is associated with 
the same object would have same values, so are either characterized as foreground or 
background. Apart from that, a morphological filter is applied on the images to eliminate 
small regions and separated pixels, such as dilate and erode filters.   
 
3.3.2 Single Gaussian Model 
 
In this technique, the information from each point of the picture is taken as a 3x1 vector, 
defining by this way the intensity and the colour. Gaussian distribution is used to define 
the values of each pixel. The background reference picture is therefore computed and 
updated with the use of ?(x,y) and covariance ?(x,y).

In equations 5 and 6, I(x,y) is a 3x1 vector containing information about the pixel colour 
and intensity. Value ? is constant and represents a learning factor. Following the update 
of the background reference picture, each pixel is classified either as background or 
foreground. All the foreground pixels are grouped together into blobs. Furthermore, the 
current frame is compared with the background reference picture using the log likelihood.

If the result of the likelihood functions is small then the corresponding pixel is classified 
as foreground or active. 
3.3.3 W4 Technique 
 
This technique was used in W4 system [10], which runs in real time and aims to detect 
and track multiple people, while at the same time monitors their activities. W4 is 
designed to work outdoors and use grayscale images. 
Moreover, W4 makes use of bimodal distribution to observe background model 
values taken from a statistical analysis of a series of background values during a training 
period.  Each pixel in the background reference picture is characterized by three values; 
pixel minimum intensity M(x), pixel maximum intensity N(x) and pixel maximum 
intensity difference between consecutive frames D(x). If for example V is considered to 
be an array of N frame series that was captured in the training period, then the 
background reference picture at a given point x would be as follows.

Where | V (x) Ð ?(x) | < 2 ?  
 
In equation 8, ?(x) is the median and ?(x) is the standard deviation values of intensities 
z
for a given pixel at position x for all the frames in V. V (x) is defined as background 
pixels. To familiarize the background reference picture with the environmental changes, 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
17W4 uses two updating methods; pixel-based update, to adjust with the background 
illumination changes and object-based update, to adjust to physical background changes. 
A car that is static for a long period of time is an example of object-based update, which 
then has to be appended to the background reference picture. 
  To define whenever an object is in foreground or not, four stages are undertaken: 
Thresholding, cleaning noises by erosion, the removal of small regions with the use of 
morphological filters and binary analysis of connected components.  
 
A pixel in position x is considered as background when: 
 
( |I (x) Ð ?(x)| ) < kD(x) 
t
 or (9) 
( |I (x) Ð N(x)| ) < kD(x) 
t
 
If the conditions are not met, it is being considered as foreground. In equation 9, k is a 
threshold constant and works better if set to 2, based on experiments performed in [10].  
 
 
 
Figure 4: Example of how W4 detects foreground objects for different threshold (k) 
values. 
 
Figure 4 shows the disparity of a foreground object detection given a different 
threshold value. At k = 2, all the foreground object regions are clearly shown. For k 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
18values that are higher than 2, regions of the objects are considered as background and are 
subtracted from the image resulting in low detection rate. On the other hand, for k values 
less than 2, impurities from the background are not filtered properly and are shown as 
foreground.  
3.4 Stereo Vision 
 
Binocular disparity is the difference in location of the same object between two almost 
identical images, the one of left and the other from the right eye [11].  
Both eyes act like a telescope placed together with a small distance among them. If 
an object is observed which lies opposite to the two telescopes, its position when 
observed with both telescopes at different times will be different. The object moves 
slightly to the right or to the left. The object location changes based on the right or left 
eye and this is because of the eyesÕ horizontal separation. This is how human eyes 
function. 
The brain uses this disparity to observe depth information from the 2D images. 
Bear in mind that, the difference in location of the same object in stereo vision refers to 
the displacement of its coordinates to the X and Y axis.  
With stereo analysis, which is the process that is being used to obtain depth 
distances from stereo images, object detection techniques can create the background 
image in a more reliable approach [12]. In such a method, it is not necessary to find 
techniques to decrease errors that result from illuminations changes, shadows and noise 
due to camera movements. Moreover, objects that are in different depth but in the 2D 
images seem to be adjacent to each other, can be recognized as different objects and can 
be processed accordingly.  
 
Figure 5 shows how far and near, in relation to the eye, objects are captured. Near 
objects are seen with a different angle than far away objects, and so the disparity between 
right and left eye has greater values. It is in this way that the depth information is taken 
from a stereo image.

Figure 5: Human eye and depth 
 
3.4.1 Stereo Analysis 
 
Stereo analysis aims to find equivalent elements between the right and the left image. 
There are two types of matching methods. On one hand, local methods try to match small 
elements between the two pictures on the basic characteristics of the elements. On the 
other hand, global methods take in account physical limitations, such as surface 
continuity. Characteristics of the elements are frequently selected to be the imageÕs 
corners, because corners remain corners in both images, and therefore are viewpoint-
independent [13].  In an area correlation method, there is a negotiation between sizes of 
the elements that are compared. Small area elements tend to be similar between the stereo 
images more frequently. Large area elements are more likely to have more noise, hence 
correlation between the images is difficult. The area correlation method discussed in [13], 
includes five steps: Geometry correction, Image transform, Area correlation, Extrema 
extraction and Post-filtering. 
 
Figure 6 illustrates the technique that is used to detect a foreground object in 
reference [12]. (a) is the initial image while in (b) the stereo disparities are shown. (c) and 
(d) show how the background and foreground regions are modelled and distinguished 
respectively.

3.4.2 Detection with Stereo 
 
Detecting an object using the depth information instead intensities information for each 
pixel, is a way to overcome problems such as global or local illumination changes and 
shadows which add impurities to the background reference picture. In references [12] and 
[14], methods are suggested to detect objects based on the depth information taken from 
stereo pictures. In such a method, the disparity image must be computed for each pair of 
stereo images. The area correlation method is used to extract the disparity image. In the 
disparity image, the disparities are inversely related to the depth as shown in the 
following formula. 
  
 D = k/x (10) 
 
In this formula, d is the disparity, k is a constant associated to camera parameters and x is 
the distance from the image to the object. Based on that, a background model is 
constructed and the foreground points of the image are grouped. A series of 
morphological filters such as dilation and erosion, are used to clear the foreground 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
21images from small regions or fracture lines. Afterwards, the background disparity image 
is updated with the use of the following formulas which give the parameter for the 
normal distribution.    
 
 
 ? (x,y) = ? ? (x,y) + (1 Ð ? ) V (x,y) (11) 
t t-1 t
 
2 2 2
 ? (x,y) = ? ? (x,y) + (1 Ð ? ) [V (x,y) Ð ? (x,y)]   (12) 
t t-1 t t
 
 
where V is the current disparity, ? and ? is the median and standard deviation for the 
t
given point.  
The constant ? is set to a high value so that the amount of data that is taken in account to 
compute the distribution is sufficient. 
 
Figure 7 shows an example of the multiple person detection method discussed in 
reference [12].  It also illustrates that two different people at different depths are detected 
by using two methods; disparity image as the background model and person templates to 
detect people.    
 
 
 
Figure 7: Person detection. 
 
 
Moreover, these techniques use person templates to detect people. Person templates are 
binary images in 2D that correspond to the human body. As the foreground region is 
detected, the next step is to compare it with the person templates. If the result of the 
comparison is high, usually above 75%, then a new person has been detected. Apart from 
that, a person can be detected in different depths. As the depth of the foreground region, 
where the object is detected is known, using the similar triangles method, the width of the 
person that is expected at that depth is estimated. The widthÕs corresponding template is 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
22selected and is compared with the foreground region. With these techniques, only one 
person template is used with different scales. In addition, person templates save 
computation time and therefore are small and do not need a lot of memory resources. 
Finally, the person region is subtracted from the foreground and the same process is 
repeated to match with more people.  
 
 
3.5 Infrared radiation 
 
The English astronomer William Hershel discovered the infrared range in 1800 [15, 16]. 
He was trying to find out which colour in the visible spectrum transfers heat from the 
sun. The electromagnetic spectrum area between the visible and microwave regions is 
called infrared, which corresponds to wavelengths from 0.74 ?m to 300 ?m. The infrared 
region (IR) is divided into three sections: the near-infrared, mid-infrared, and far-infrared.  
 
? Near IR: 700 nmÐ1400 nm (0.7 µm Ð 1.4 µm, 215 THz - 430 THz) 
 
? Mid IR: 1400 nmÐ3000 nm (1.4 µm Ð 3 µm, 100 THz - 215 THz) 
 
? Far IR: 3000 nmÐ1 mm (3 µm Ð 1000 µm, 300 GHz - 100 THz) 
 
Near infrared region acts like visible light and is used for the purposes of this project. 
Moreover, photography in near infrared range has embedded novel characteristics to art 
images. Images are also taken in the far infrared range and are called thermal images. 
Such images are taken from a special camera that sense thermal emission from person 
and objects.  
Images in the infrared region have special characteristics and thus are commonly 
used into several military projects. In addition, application for research and civilian 
purposes also exist. Target acquisition, night vision surveillance and tracking are some of 
the applications that have been implemented for military reasons. On the other hand, 
environmental monitoring, head analysis, food and material analysis, remote controlling, 
weather forecasting, and measuring heat from distance are areas where infrared is 
commonly used.  
Figure 8 shows the electromagnetic spectrum from Gamma ray until Radio 
waves. It also shows the frequency and temperature that corresponds to each part, while 
with the use of images the wavelength size of each region is illustrated. 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
23 
Figure 8: Electromagnetic spectrum [17]. 
 
Near infrared spectrum has photographically been measured by Abney and 
Festing, to be in the range of 700 to 1200 nm in 1881 [15]. Despite the fact that near 
infrared is the closest in wavelength to visible light, human eye cannot sense it. Thus, the 
observation of near infrared characteristics is done through silicon sensors. Near infrared 
radiation is used in quite a lot of fields nowadays. The fact that near infrared has less 
attenuation losses in glass, has made their usage in fiber optic telecommunication more 
frequently. Moreover, near infrared is used to analyse materials such as plastic, polymers 
and fake notes. In addition, dairy and baking industry use near infrared to analyse raw 
materials for their products. On the other hand, beverage industry use applications based 
on near infrared to choose ingredients for their alcoholic beverages. 
Figure 9 shows visible and infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Infrared 
radiation is above the red colour of visible light and that is the reason for its name. From 
the word infra that means beyond in Latin. Moreover, in this figure the corresponding 
wavelengths for each colour in visible spectrum and for each part of the infrared light are 
shown. 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering

Figure 9: Infrared spectrum [18] 
 
3.6 Infrared Camera  
 
On the contrary, standard cameras use visible light to create an image, while infrared 
cameras operate at greater wavelengths and create an image using the infrared radiation. 
Based on body temperature that results to heat being radiated by a body, infrared cameras 
became a valuable tool for use in a dark or smoke filled environment for rescue 
operations.  
 They are related to the project through the fact that images from infrared cameras 
are likely to have a single color. Moreover, in reality these images are shown with some 
color to be clearer and more understandable. It is generally uses white color for the 
warmest parts of the image, red and yellow for medium temperatures and blue for the 
coolest parts.  Due to the fact that this project aims to detect moving objects in a class 
where objects in the vision range of the camera would have lower temperature than the 
lecturer, infrared cameras may be a solution to factors that affect the results of object 
detection methods and techniques.   
 Night vision cameras on the other hand, are operating in the same way with 
ordinary cameras. However, they lack of a filter that prevents sensing near infrared light. 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
25Such cameras are used in surveillance systems to monitor areas at night. With out the cut 
off IR filter, this kind of cameras can sense near infrared radiation and with an infrared 
illuminator can capture images at total dark conditions.  
 
3.7 OpenCV 
 
OpenCV is a library that was born in Intel, written in C and C++ and is related to 
computer vision applications [4]. It open source and console free library, meaning that 
can runs under several operating systems. OpenCV can benefits from multicore 
processors, thus is specialised in real Ð time applications with effort to computational 
efficiency. Stereo vision, product inspections, robotics and medical imaging are some of 
the fields that cover by functions of OpenCV library.  
 The project makes use of the OpenCV library to improve the performance of the 
computations. Moreover, specialised fixtures, such as ROI are used in the way of solving 
the project problem.

264 Implementation 
 
This section provides information about the method that was used and the steps that were 
taken to achieve the desired results. In addition, the hardware and software that were used 
are explained in more depth.   
 
4.1 Hardware 
 
The hardware that was used for this project was a night vision infrared camera with 
embedded infrared LEDs and an IR-pass filter. At the final stage, the elements were 
combined to create a solid optical sensor for easier use. The components were selected 
after experiments in terms of the projects aim and objectives.  
 
4.1.1 Infrared night vision camera 
 
Infrared cameras are nowadays more commonly used by surveillance systems. The main 
advantage of using this type of cameras is that they provide clear view of the scene in 
total dark environment conditions. Therefore, they can monitor the area at night, where 
the most malicious actions take place. Night vision cameras use the infrared part of the 
electromagnetic spectrum, thus the information that are capturing is the reflection of the 
infrared light. The fact that the infrared light is not visible to the human eye makes them 
perfect for their usage. A large amount of night vision cameras are self illuminated and 
have a ring of infrared LEDs surrounding the image sensor. A web night vision camera 
was used for the purpose of this project. The camera [19] has the ability to connect to 
computer thought a USB cable and has built in six infrared Light Emmiting Diodes 
(LEDs). The video quality is 1.3 Mega pixels at 640 x 480 pixels per frame. Also, a ring 
in front of the sensor does the focusing function manually. It can work with almost all 
Windows versions and can be used with most internet communication applications. 
Figure 10 shows the infrared night vision camera that was used, before any modification.  
 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
27 
Figure 10: Night vision web camera with 6 infrared LEDs embedded. 
 
After the first experiment, the infrared light that is created by the LEDs was not strong 
enough for the project demands. therefore, for the testing experiments the infrared light 
provided by the environment was used. The reason for that was mainly the distance 
between the camera and the screen. The camera LEDs have the ability to emit infrared 
light for the distance of about one meter. However, the average distance between the 
projector, where the camera is placed, and the screen, is approximately five meters. 
Hence, tests in total dark conditions are not viable  
 
A critical factor in using an infrared camera was the quality of the images that 
were captured by a typical and night vision camera. An infrared-pass filter was used in 
front of both camera lens to let only the infrared light pass through and thus, the image 
was a result of infrared light reflection only. The typical camera has poor quality images 
compared to the ones that were captured by the night vision camera. A filter that is built 
in the lens of most common cameras is the reason for poor quality infrared images. The 
filter cuts off a big amount of infrared light to ensure better quality in true color images. 
Therefore, only a night vision camera can be used for the project which allows for the 
entire available infrared light to pass thought the lens. 
 
Figure 11 shows two images captured from a typical camera with an infrared 
filter. Small amount of infrared light passes through the lens; hence, it can only capture 
outdoor images. Indoor images are dark and thus, even when the images are processed 
the results are inadequate for further analysis.  
 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
28     
 
Figure 11: Images from typical camera with infrared pass filter.  
 
 
As it is clearly shown in Figure 12, images from night vision camera with the 
infrared pass filter in front of the camera lens are clear enough to be process. Indoor and 
outdoors images are containing sufficient light details. Both cameras are true color and 
any changes on colors are due to the infrared filter.     
 
      
 
Figure 12: Images from night vision camera with infrared pass filter. 
 
4.1.2 IR Filter 
 
IR filters are usually called the filters that allow infrared light to pass through while 
blocking any other wavelength. Typically, camera sensors are sensitive to near-infrared 
wavelength and infrared cut-off filters are used to block infrared light. This is done to 
reduce the event of unnatural looking images. In contrast, an IR pass filter is used for this 
project. The purpose of the filter is to eliminate any visible light from the captured 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
29images. A major problem was the alteration of physical characteristics of the object that 
are exposed to projector light. The light from the projector in most cases changes the 
color and light characteristics of the objects. As a result, there was faulty detection and no 
detection of the objects, which also matched the experimental results. Therefore, with the 
use of the IR-pass filter was achieved to eliminate that problem.  
 
 
Figure 13: IR-pass Filter 760nm functionality 
 
The IR filter that was used for this project allows any wavelength which is greater than 
760nm to pass through. Figure 13 shows the filter functionality with the visible and near 
infrared wavelengths. The visible spectrum is in the region where no transmission passes 
through the filter. In the wavelength range above 760nm (394THz), all the light passes 
through. 
 
 Figure 14 illustrates the functionality of the filter over a laptop screen. The screen 
works with the same principle as the projector. It emits light to show the information to 
the user. Both pictures were captured with the same night vision camera and without any 
special effect at the same time period. The left image shows the screen and the IR filter in 
front of the camera lens. The picture at the right shows the laptop screen without the IR 
filter. It is clear that the image captured with the IR filter illustrates the screen being 
turned off. This is a real example of how the filter cuts off the visible spectrum and 
removes any information lying in that range. The fact that near infrared light performs 
with the same way as the visible light, results in the image shown at the left hand side. 
The darker color spots are a result of near infrared light being reflected less and vise 
versa for lighter spots.  
 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
30      
 
Figure 14: IR Filter functionality over laptop screen 
 
Moreover, a final test undertaken before further implementation was to verify 
whether the projector emits any near - infrared radiation. Such a finding would be a 
complete failure for the further development of the project. Fortunately, after experiments 
on the projectors, it was not found to emit any near infrared radiation. Otherwise, the near 
infrared radiation from the projector would have the same actions on the object like the 
visible light, because the spread over the whole screen would not be uniform.  
 
Figure 15, show the filter that was used in the project. The label IR760 indicates 
that this filter allows any wavelength greater that 760nm to pass through and the label 
58mm shows the diameter of the filter.   
 
Figure 15: IR760 infrared pass filter 
 
4.1.3 Optical Sensor 
 
All the hardware elements used in the project were combined together to construct a solid 
optical sensor. A cylindrical shell was adjusted into the camera stand surrounding the 
camera. The cylindrical shell has a diameter of 58 mm; hence, the IR filter fits in the edge 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
31of the case. In addition to that, the IR filter can be easily removed from the case and vice 
versa without any difficulty. With this straightforward modification, the testing phase 
was easier in cases were the filter had to be removed from the case to have a true color 
image capture. Figure 16 shows the optical sensor in its final state. 
 
 
     
 
Figure 16: Project Optical Sensor 
 
 
4.2 Software 
 
The software for this project was firstly written in a higher level language and at a second 
stage was written in C. At the first stage, object detection algorithms were written in 
MatLab. MatLab has special mechanisms to deal with data and especially images. It is 
commonly used for simulation and it is easier to work with table equations. Every entry 
data in MatLab is represented as a table, likewise grayscale images are represented as a 
two dimensional table. In addition, it provides already made routines for image 
processing. After several simulations of the algorithms and testing the new idea of using 
near infrared to solve the problem, the project was processed to the second stage. The 
second stage of software involves C and OpenCV. With the fist stage, the idea with 
object detection algorithm and near infrared was tested and confirmed that it worked. 
Performance and few improvements were added to the second stage to archive real time 
processing. 
 
 
 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
324.2.1 MatLab Programming 
 
The initial phase of software programming was written in MatLab. At the beginning, a 
single camera was used to provide image samples. Due to the fact that near infrared has 
no color information and it is using a single image channel, grayscale images were firstly 
used. Firstly, the camera setup is written in the code to connect with MatLab. This 
connection is done through a mechanism that MatLab provides. Also, the color space and 
image dimensions were set in this part of the code. The image dimensions that were used 
was 640 x 480.Furthermore, the background image is created. A series of ten frames are 
captured and then the average of each pixel value is computed to create the background 
mode. This is done to ensure that any small alternation to pixel intensity will not affect 
the background model. Thereafter, a new frame is captured. Each absolute pixel value 
from the new frame is subtracted from the corresponding pixel in the background model.  
 
Since the representation of black is 0 and of white is 255, all the differences are 
marked with shades of white. Absolute subtraction is used to show all the possible 
differences of the two images. With single subtraction, if a brighter spot is subtracted 
from a darker would result in no difference, because the negative values are counted as 
zero. A new image is then created to show the differences between the background and 
current frame. Subsequently the differences image is thresholded. 
 
Thresholding is the procedure where the differences image is converted to binary 
image. In this procedure, each pixel of the differences image is compared to a value. If 
the pixel value is greater than the threshold value, then the specific pixel is characterised 
as foreground and is marked in a new image with black color. All the pixels that are 
characterised as background are marked in the new image with white color. The new 
image can be identified as mask image because that image at the end of the whole process 
would be the dynamic mask.   
 
After thresholding and the creation of the mask image, noise has to be removed. 
A series of morphological filters are applied to the image. Firstly, a structure element is 
created. The structural element will pass through all the mask image and any change to 
the pixel values, will be applied based on the disk structure element. For noise removal, 
two filters are used, the open filter and the close filter. In the case of open filter, an erode 
operation is done and then a dilation [4]. In the case of the close filter, a dilation is firstly 
applied and an erosion following that.  
 
Dilation is the operation that is done over an image with the use of a structural 
element, or otherwise called kernel. Often, the structural element can have any shape or 
size. In most of the cases, the element is a small square or a disk and has a single 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
33predefined anchor point, where it is frequently the centered pixel. For the purpose of this 
project, the structural element is a small disk with size 7 pixels long. The element passes 
over the image and computes the maximum pixel values  contained. The image pixel 
value is replaced at the position of anchor point with the maximum local value. In other 
words, it is the computation of the local maximum of the pixels that are overlapped by 
the structural element. This has as a result the growth of white areas within the image. 
Erosion is the inverse operation. In the case of erosion, a local minimum is computed and 
it has as a result to increase the dark areas in an image.  
With the open filter performing erosion at first, any small bright areas are 
removed. The removed white pixels are mainly noise due to camera distortion. 
Subsequently, dilation is performed to increase the bright area, which is the detected area, 
and is thus containing the objects. The white pixels are the foreground of the image and 
increasing them improves the final shape of the mask. A close filter is applied to the 
mask image to improved and smoothen its shape. 
 
Finally, the mask image is applied on top of the slide that is going to be projected 
next. In MatLab, the mask image is applied to the frame that has been captured. MatLab 
was only used to simulate the system functionality and for testing, hence there was no 
need to create a function that produces the modified slide.   
 Figure 17 shows the output obtained from MatLab. Starting from the top left 
corner, the background image is shown, until the bottom right corner, a series of images 
show all the steps of the systemÕs functionality. In this figure, it is clearly shown how 
morphological filters are smoothing the detected foreground.

4.2.2 Algorithm Representation 
 
With the use of a flowchart, tables and images, the system functionality is represented. 
The following flowchart shows the main loop and the setup step. In addition, the optical 
sensor has to be placed on top of the projector. Once the system has beet setup, the main 
loop runs until the ESC key is pressed. In C application, background reading step and the 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
34area of interest step can be reset while the loop is running. However, starting values are 
set to allow the application to start.

Figure 18 shows the background model. At the left is the data representation and at the 
right is an actual image captured during testing. They do not have any relation between 
them. The values inside the table have been randomly selected as an example. Real 
images are put to show the visual representation of each algorithm step. Each cell of the 
table represents a pixel in a real image. Values near 255 correspond to a shade of white. 
As it is common for the projection screen to have a white color, values near to that are 
selected for the example. In addition, due to the use of the IR filter, highest white values 
are sensing less.  
 
Figure 19 illustrates the current input frame. The green color represents the new object in 
the scene. On the right corners, there are two pixels with different color to represent noise 
in the current frame. The new object has pixels values less than the previous one at the 
same position. This is how a new object is sensed in terms of the data. In a real life 
example, human hair commonly has darker color than the human face and the same 
applies to human eyes. However, human eyes tend to have a shiny color when observing 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
35within the near Ð infrared range. Eyes, as found in experiments, reflect the near-infrared 
light more than the human skin. Nevertheless, that shining dot does not affect the system 
functionality.

Figure 19: Current frame 
 
The absolute subtraction step is shown in Figure 20. Each pixel of the current frame is 
subtracted from the corresponding pixel from the background model. Same pixels after 
subtraction as expected, have zero value, thus the detection is shown in shade of white in 
real image example. Darker colour hairs are shown to have the highest differences 
compared to the background model. In contrary, the shirt is almost the same colour with 
the background and thus the detection to that area complicated. Fortunately, the skin 
colour is in the middle and after subtraction, pixel have values high enough to be 
processed correctly.

Figure 21 shows the result of thresholding step. Threshold value for the table examples 
 
was assumed to be just over 30, thus the noise pixel in the right top corner was 
eliminated. Moreover, the resulting image is in binary form and white pixels are 
represented with the value of one and black pixels with the value of zero. This step does 
not manage to remove the noise pixel at the right bottom corner, which is shown with 
different colour, due to high value that the pixel used to have. Nevertheless, the mask 
image is at the beginning of its final form. Normally, the foreground object has to 
represented with white colour while the background with black. An inversion has already 
been performed to the image due to the fact that in mask image the foreground is more 
useful to be marked as black. 
As expected in the real image example, the area under the head, which includes 
the neck and shirt, is considered as background. The edges of the black objects are rough 
and there are also some small defects in the inside area.

37The results of the morphological filtering step are also illustrated. A structural element, or 
kernel, of three pixels in row shapes is used in this example which is shown in Figure 22. 
With lighter red colour, on the left top corner, the kernel is shown processing the second 
pixel of the array. The final position of the kernel is shown with red colour at the right 
bottom corner. At that position, the remaining noise pixel will be processed and due to 
the filter functionality will be removed. The image at the right which shows the real 
image example, illustrates the changes of that step in the black object. The rough edges 
have been smoothed and the small white dots inside the object have been removed. At the 
end of this step the mask image is in its final form. 
 
   
 
Figure 22: Morphological filtering 
 
Figure 23 shows the final resulting image of the system. Given the mask and a slide 
image created previously, the system combines the two images and produces a final 
image which is shown at the left. The mask image is scanned and when a back pixel is 
found, it is copied in the corresponding position in the slide image. The mask image acts 
like a dynamic filter which is created with every captured frame and blocks the projection 
of light within the black area. The right image shows the output of MatLab, which 
simulates the ground truth after the projection of the final image which the system has 
created.

4.2.3 C Programming  
 
After the first implementation in MatLab, the algorithm was converted to C code. In 
addition OpenCV library was used. The purpose of the conversion was to give 
performance to the application and make it real time. Comparing the two, C applications 
perform better with the same quality results. In addition, C code has some extra fixtures 
to adjust the image mask with the presented slides.  
 The same methodology is used in C code to read the background image as a first 
step. Furthermore, in C application a menu window is shown to give to the user an 
interaction with the process. The background reading can be done more than one times, 
with the use of a button. This addition helps in situations that the camera has moved from 
its initial position and the background image has to be recreated.  
The presentation slides are read by the applications in image form in the setup 
phase. In addition, at the same phase a small window in the image is created. With the 
use of the window, the area of the projection in the screen is set. The window shows that 
only the projected area is important and all image process is done only within the 
windowÕs margins. This allows less processing time per frame, due to fewer pixels in 
frame, hence greater performance.  
Figure 24 shows the menu window. At the top is the button, in track bar shape for 
background reading. The next track bar allows the user to adjust the threshold value. As 
the figure shows, a lot of noise is detected as foreground. The fact that noise is outside 
the area of interest, it is excluded to be cleaned in the subsequent step. Inside this area, 
the noise is cleared, improving in this way the performance of the system. 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
39 
 
Figure 24: Menu window 
 
In OpenCV, this window is called ÔRegion Of Interest (ROI)Õ and can be set to 
any image. In C application, ROI can be set by left clicking on the left top corner and by 
right clicking on the right bottom corner of the projection screen. Figure 25 shows the 
ROI window as it is set to enclose the projected area. The left image is grayscale and has 
been captured without the IR filter to help set the region of interest.  On the image at the 
right, the ROI window is shown as the camera has the IR filter. In the setup phase, all the 
preview windows and memory space for images are created and connection with camera 
and slides size adjustments, are performed as well. 
 
   
 
Figure 25: Presented area window. (ROI) 
 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
40Moreover, the algorithm function is called. In that function, the absolute 
subtractions between the current frame and the background image is done, creating a new 
image which will be the mask image at a later step in the procedure. A dilation filter is 
applied over the resulting image to increase the foreground detected area. 
 The thresholding step comes next to create the binary mask image. Lot of noise 
pixels are cut out within that step. Afterwards, another function is called to perform more 
morphological filters and combine the slide image with the mask. The threshold value is 
adjustable by the user, in order to have better control over the application and to be able 
to regulate it better to any environment conditions. 
The ApplyMask function, resizes the mask image to the size of the slide. Again, 
only the interested area of the mask image is resized and then a dilation filter is applied to 
smooth any defects that are left over from resizing. Moreover, the mask image is 
combined with the slide with a procedure that scans the mask image for black pixels and 
copies them at the same location in the slide image. Then, the slide image contains a solid 
black shape that refers to the object that has been detected. Finally, the slide is presented 
and the light is removed from the presenter. Figure 26 shows how the system affects the 
presentation. At the left image, the system was turned off and the light from the projector 
goes to presenterÕs eyes.  The right image was captured after turning the system on and 
shows that no light goes to presenter eyes. 
 
    
 
  Figure 26: Presentation with and without system running 
 
The execution speed time of the C code is approximately 55ms per frame or 18 
frames per second, which is fast enough to be characterised as real time application. The 
speed has been measured after running the code on a laptop, with two core CPU running 
at 2GHz. The images from the camera were 640 x 480 pixels. 
 
 C application can be seen in Figure 27. At the left is the menu window, which has 
the background reading and threshold track bars. Also, in menu window the results of the 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
41background subtraction algorithm are shown. With white color are the points in the 
current frame that are different from the background image. Inside the rectangle, which is 
the region of interest, is the mask image after noise removal and smoothing. The area 
outside the rectangle shows the detected foreground without performing any process on 
it. The current frame captured by the optical sensor, is illustrated in the CrayScale 
window, which is the image in the middle of the figure. CrayScale is the window that 
ROI can be set by left clicking on the left top corner and by right clicking on the right 
bottom corner. The Sample window is located on the right which shows the output of the 
system. The combination of the slide image, which has been loaded at the setup phase, 
and mask images is illustrated at that window. Furthermore, the projector has to project 
the sample window to have the desired results.

425 Tests and Results Analysis  
  
The system was tested in terms of detection and covering with different people. The aim 
of those tests was to check if the system functions correctly with different people in terms 
of their skin color. In addition, people wearing glasses were also used in test, checking if 
this alternation affects the functionality of the system. The system was also tested with 
placing the camera in different distances from the screen. The results of those tests are 
analysed and presented in the rest of the chapter.  
 
5.1 Room Environment  
 
Tests were performed in an environment similar to the lecture room. The background 
screen was white to represent a real projection screen and the light was at the same level 
as in the presentation. EnvironmentÕs infrared light was used. All the test were taken 
under the same room environment. 
5.2 Distance Test 
 
The distance tests were performed to check the systemÕs functionality within different 
distances between the optical sensor and the objects. The testing distances cover the 
range of two to four meters. These distances are chosen to be tested because are common 
distances between the projector and the screen. Three images are captured and processed 
per checkpoint. The system passed successfully the tests, managing to correctly detect 
and cover the personÕs eyes in all situations.  Moreover, in all the tests the system 
managed to cover the head of the person, hence it functions perfectly for the distances 
between two and four meter. The results for that test were as expected 
 
Figure 28,Figure 29 and Figure 30 shows the captured data from that test. For 
each distance test, one of the three captures is shown. As it is clearly shown, the system 
covers the head of the person in all the images. The threshold value was set to 15 and the 
structure element size was six. In addition, the steps of the procedure are shown with the 
usage of six images. In the left upper corner the background frame is illustrated, which 
corresponds to the background model.

The upper middle image shows the current captured frame and at the right of the first row 
is the image that contains the result of absolute subtraction. Then, the mask image is 
initiated. The bottom left image shows the resulting image after the threshold step. 
 
 
 
Figure 29: Three meters test 
 
The image in the middle of the second row shows the mask image after being processed 
by morphological filters. The foreground object has a solid shape with smoother edges. 
The last image at the right shows the output of the system. The system manages to detect 
and cover the whole head of the person. 
Furthermore, in Figure 30, the systemÕs reaction to noise is illustrated. As it is 
shown in the threshold image, which is located at the left in the second row, a square 
shape object is seen above the person.  That noise is removed in the next step, while the 
only thing remaining is the personÕs mask.

5.3 Front Face Test 
 
For the purpose of that test, participants were asked to look at the audience direction 
simulating the most common position of the presenter. The room environment was the 
same as previously taken tests. Moreover, the test was subdivided into two major parts. 
The first part was about marking the object from two different distances and the second 
part, aims to examine people's skin colour. For the distance test part, the distances of two 
and four meters, which referred as near and far, are selected to be observed.   Participants 
are classified based on their skin colour from one to three, in which one corresponds to 
brightest, and three to darkest colour. Furthermore, two regions of the head are set to be 
the interested area; eyes and the whole head, with eyes to be the most important spot. A 
sample to be calculated as successful has to firstly cover the eyes area and then the whole 
head area. After analysing the result, system is shown to function perfectly to near 
distances with 100% detection in eyesÕ area.  As it is also shown in  
Table 1, the detection for the head area at the same distance was 80%. However, the 
detection ratio for the far distance was lower, limiting to 71% to eyes area and just 43% 
to the head area. A possible reason for the low detection ratio can be the low amount of 
infrared light at the tests time. In addition, given that at near distances the ratio is high 
enough, a camera with greater resolution, from the one that was used, is possible to have 
higher detection ratio.

Results from the front face detection test are shown is Figure 31. On the left hand side 
image, the captured frame can be seen. Next, at the right of each row the mask and the 
final output of the system is shown. The last row of images is an example of successful 
detection in eyes area but unsuccessful detection on the head. Overall, for this part of the 
test, the system managed to gain 86% detecting eyes area and 62% for headÕs area 
detection. 
 
 
 
Figure 31: Results from front face test. 
 
As already mentioned, the people that participated on the test have been labeled with a 
value from one to three that corresponds to the skin tone. Once the results had been 
analysed, the following table was produced.  Table 2 presents the results taken from the 
skin color test. As it is clearly shown, detection ratio for people with darker color is 
higher. The same applies to people within the middle skin tone. For brighter skin colour 
the detection ratio is lower as they match more with the screen colour 
 
Skin Colour Test Eyes detection ratio Head detection ratio 
Colour 1 (brighter) 71% 42% 
Colour 2 100% 60% 
Colour 3 (darker) 100% 100% 
Total  90% 67% 
Table 2: Front face test, Colour skin test detection rates 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
46At the head detection column, the results were 42%, 60% and 100% from bright to 
darker skin tone respectively. In general, the detection ratios for this part of the test were 
90% for the eyes area and 67% for the head area. 
5.4 Side Face Test 
 
For the side detection test the participants were asked to look sideways, in order to 
simulate the situation where the presenter tries to show something on the screen. 
Moreover, the final head position that the project needs to operate is completed 
successful and therefore at any angle beyond the final operating angle, the detecting 
procedure does not need to be processed correctly by the system. Following the same 
procedure as previous tests, the working environment conditions were the same and the 
side face test was divided into two major subparts; distance test and skin colour test. 
Participants maintain the same label for skin color as the checkpoint at two and four 
meter distance from screen is also observed. The same evaluation criteria were followed 
as the interested regions were continued to be the eyes and head. As it is shown in Table 
3, the distance is seen not to affect the detection ratio. On the other hand, detection ratio 
in the head area observed to be low. This does not affect the system functionality, thus 
the main reason for low ratio is commonly small holes or defects in mask head shape. 
The important eyes area was fully detected in this test at the same time as in total for 
headÕs area the ratio was 60%.

Near 100% 57% 
100% 63% 
Far 
Total 100% 60% 
Table 3: Side face test, Distance test detection rates 
 
Furthermore, in the skin color test, as shown in Table 4, eyes area has fully detected 
correctly. Once again, the headÕs area detection ratio was observed to be low, resulting in 
40% for brighter skin colours and 57% for middle skin tone. The systemÕs total ratio at 
the headÕs area detection has increased after detecting correctly all the samples from 
people with darker skin colour. 
 
Skin Colour Test Eyes detection ratio Head detection ratio 
Colour 1 (brighter) 100% 40% 
Colour 2 100% 57% 
Colour 3 (darker) 100% 100% 
100% 66%

Table 4: Side face test, Colour skin test detection rates

47In Figure 32, results are illustrated for the side face test. It is clearly shown why 
the headÕs area detection has inadequate results. Four of the six output results observed to 
have defects in the shape of the mask. In addition, the significant value of morphological 
filtering in improving cover mark can be seen in  the second and third column. 
 
 
 
Figure 32:  Results from side face test 
 
5.5 Two People in Screen Test 
 
In this test, the performance of the system was measured when two people are appearing 
in the screen area. The distance where the frames were captured was fixed at three 
meters. The participants differ in skin colour, with the one having brighter skin tone than 
the other. Again, the environment was the same as the other tests and the same evaluation 
method was applied. The participants were free to look in any direction thus, to simulate 
actual head movements which take place in a presentation. Table 5 shows that the system 
managed to get an 80% detection ratio overall in the eyes area and 70% in the head area. 
The detection in headÕs area is slightly better for darker skin colour than brighter ones. 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
48For brighter skin color an average of 60% detection ratio was achieved where in darker 
skin colours the ratio was 80%

5.6 Free Moving Test 
 
The last test was performed to evaluate the system functionality when participants move 
freely in the room and act naturally like in a real presentation. The distance between the 
screen and the camera was set to four meter. For this test, the different skin colors were 
not taken in account. Moreover, the same room environment and assessment method as 
for all other tests was carried out. The system is shown to perform well with 90% 
detection ratio in the eyes area, while in the headÕs area the detection ratio was 67%.  
 
5.7 Overall Detection Ratio 
 
Table 6, illustrates the overall arithmetic results that were measured after the system had 
successfully completed several tests.  The overall marking for the system detection ratio 
is 94%, with the most important being the eyes area.  
 
Test Eyes detection ratio Head detection ratio 
Front face test 89% 78% 
Side face test 100% 60% 
100% 100% 
Near distance 
Far distance 87% 53% 
Free moving  90% 67% 
Two person 80% 70% 
Overall samples 94% 69% 
 
Table 6: Overall detection ratio results 
 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
49The resulting tests were as expected. Higher detection rate to side face tests than to front 
face test was anticipated. The eyes area is greater when a person is facing the camera, 
thus possibilities for fault in detection are higher. Therefore, detection ratio on side face 
test achieved the maximum possible.   
Moreover, the darker skin colors seem to have an advantage over brighter in terms of 
system performance. The lack of colour, due to IR filter, turns to complex detection when 
the personÕs skin colour is brighter. Commonly distinguishing between background and 
foreground in such situations are difficult and thresholding with a proper value is crucial.  
On the other hand, the lower ratio at far distances detection appears to be an effect of 
low amount of infrared light. Furthermore, the standard cameraÕs resolution shows to be 
another factor that affects the quality of the results.  
For greater distances, image pixel tents to cover more area on the person body than 
in shorter distances. Thus, images captured from a distance, contains distorted 
information about shapes and colours. Decreasing the size of structural element will 
partly improve the detection ratio. A camera with greater resolution will significantly 
improve the performance of the system, not only at long distances, but also short. 
However, the cost was set to the lowest possible, thus to have a solution available to 
everyone.

506 Objectives Evaluation 
 
The project has achieved its objectives successfully. Experiments have shown that the 
algorithm successfully detected 94% of the tested situations and the presenterÕs eyes have 
been covered. Moreover, with the appropriate working environment study, the 
implementation of such a complex object detection algorithm which will decrease the 
performance of the systems was prevented. Furthermore, with the addition of near 
infrared imaging fixtures, the simplification of definition and implementation of the 
background model has been enabled, maintaining the quality of the results.  
 The application has been tested on a laptop machine with two cores, running at 2 
MHz, two Giga Bytes ram memory with 32-bit windows operating system. The result has 
been measured to be 55ms per frame. This speed provides approximately 18 frames per 
second and thus the applications can been characterised as real time. Hence, the 
previously mentioned system specifications set the minimum system requirements.        
 
 
Loukas Xyda, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 
517 Conclusion 
 
The system manages to achieve its aim and works in real time with quality results. It 
produces images to project with the rate of 18 frames per second. 
However, improvements in the algorithm and to the entire system can be done. 
Experiments show that the system performs better if the infrared light is opposite to the 
object. With a self illuminator infrared source, the capabilities of the system can expand 
and increase the possibility of working in total dark conditions. Furthermore, the use of 
the IR filter, introduces a new way of background image creation and sensing for such 
applications. Hence, a review can be examined in running systems.  
Moreover, an intermediate device which will act as the computer can be introduced. 
The new device will release the computer from the effort to process all the data and thus 
will increase the outcome rate of the system. Such a device is a signal processor unit. In 
addition, the portability of the system will increase, making it possible to run on more 
operating systems. The addition of the new processing device can be combined with the 
appropriate code to fit on the machine. 
WhatÕs more, the solution approach can be altered in terms of the algorithms that 
were used. In a more powerful system, a face detection algorithm would prove to be a 
better methodology to follow.
