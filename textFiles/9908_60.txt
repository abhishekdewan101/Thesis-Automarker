Abstract 
 
Manually control each individual?s behaviour in a crowd scene is very difficult. Manually 
modelling and animating each individual in a virtual environment is also time-consuming and 
impractical. A work process for crowd simulation generally consists of framework design, 
behaviour design and crowd visualization. Our work mainly contributes to the first two parts of 
a process: framework design, behaviour design. And we also give an overview research on the 
crowd visualization in crowd simulation area. Therefore our project is divided into three parts: 
First, we give a comprehensive background investigation on crowd simulation in each industry 
and provide different perspective of its research area based on different classification system. 
Secondly, we discuss about our behaviour design in detail. This is core skeleton of crowd 
model. A hierarchy-based model is introduced in this section and FSM is applied in our 
behaviour data structure. Also technical issues of crowd behaviour are emphasized with the 
concern of social, psychological factors. Finally, crowd variety and details of crowd 
representation are discussed including imposter, LOD, etc.  
 
¥ Our work designs a behaviour model for crowd spectator simulation, specifically, on making 
spectator crowd have reactions when particular events in a sports game happen.  
¥ We design a convenient production tool for animators to avoid duplicative work in simulating 
spectator crowd.  
¥ A comprehensive research on crowd design, crowd behaviour and crowd representation is 
involved.

Chapter1. Introduction and Context 
 
1.1 Aims and objectives 
 
Nowadays, with the rapid development of film and game industries, there is a need for in-house 
or commercial software which helps animators create a crowd scene, especially for those 
animators without programming experience. Although modelers are able to model precise 
human templates and animators can produce perfect animation for each human model, they still 
meet many obstacles when making a crowd scene with hundreds, thousands of people or even 
more. Therefore our work is not about modelling precise human templates or making good 
character animation. Our aim is producing a crowd simulation production tool which mainly 
has two tasks: (1) Setting up the behaviour model for crowd spectator simulation; (2) Producing 
an easy animation tool for animators to populate spectator crowd more efficiently. These are 
where our original ideas come from and why we start this project. Based on the research about 
crowd?s behavioural and social factors, we provide a framework of crowd spectator simulation 
for sports games. And also we describe several techniques that allow us to achieve interactive 
behaviours of crowd in sports game.  
 
The core aim of our project is the interactive crowd scene which is created based on 
implementing suitable behaviours for the spectator crowd.  In our work, we introduce a 
hierarchy-based behaviour model which including three levels: (1) an external control is created 
which allows the user to be able to initialise crowd behaviours and a friendly user interface for 
external behaviour control is designed; (2) group control helps manipulate different teams of 
crowd and those teams have different reaction and different goals; (3) individual control which 
helps crowd react in different emotional ways is based on each character's emotion attributes. 
All of these three points will be discussed in detail in chapter 3.

Chapter2. Background and related work 
 
2.1 Background  
 
2.1.1 What is an agent? 
 
Macal and North (2005) lists several definitions of agent which are proposed by former 
researchers [11]. They indicate that agents should have five features: identifiable, situated, 
flexible, goal-directed, and autonomous (self-directed). Figure 1 gives the definition of an agent. 
Four reasons are given by them to explain why ABS (agent-based system) is become more and 
more popular on a worldwide level: Firstly, the interdependency among various industries leads 
to traditional modelling method reaching its limit. Secondly, no matter artificial intelligence, 
economic market or other areas, most modern research areas are becoming more and more 
complex because many realistic models are added into these researches. Some traditional 
assumptions and data are becoming obsolete to some extent. Thirdly, modern research always 
involves more finer-level data. Lastly, hardware and software development makes many 
ÒimpossibleÓ model implementations designed several years ago feasible.

Agent-based crowd is originated from the creation of ABS (or ABMS). The theory of ABS was 
first originated from the design of Game of Life (Gardner 1970). It is the simplest model of 
agent-based system. Crowd simulation is only one branch of ABS application. Now it has 
become a complex subject which involves with not only computer science, but also system 
dynamics, social and management science and complexity and management science [11]. They 
indicate that the goal of agent-based system is simulating individual behaviours and social rules. 
In sum, there is still no uniform definition of agent in this field. Table 1 provides a 
summarization of agent-based modelling technique applications.

2.1.2 Overview of crowd simulation 
 
Nowadays, crowd control has been applied in many industries such as military, architecture, 
sociology, etc. Figure 2 shows an overview of crowd control application in each industry. 
Different crowd applications have different design models, script languages and algorithms [17]. 
Some industries focus on the crowd?s Òexplicit featuresÓ like appearance, relative position and 
quality of model templates [4]. Some others dig deep into how the crowd?s psychological and 
social behaviour change over time under different situations [13]. Generally, the differences 
between crowd research areas are: crowd model design, behaviour concern, model template and 
rendering techniques. Although computer crowd simulation is a new research area which starts 
in the middle and late 90s, mass and crowd behaviour has been studied since the end of 19
th
 
century. Moreover, although there are a wide range of areas where crowd simulation has been 
applied into, the research in one area is often isolated from another Ð their interdisciplinary 
communication is not enough [10].

Behaviour of crowd has been studied a lot in the psychological and social area. The main idea 
for behaviour of crowd is that each individual will get rid of his own individuality to adopt the 
trend of a crowd, which is completely different as that of being alone [10]. The motion of 
crowd can be defined as homogeneous and complicated: homogeneous means synchronised or 
united revealed in the crowd motion, and complicated means crowd motion involves many 
parameters to control crowd behaviours. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Overview of crowd application in each industry. Source: Ref. [2]. 
 
A crowd, which refers to an uncertain number of individuals, is ubiquitous and constantly-
changing no matter in real world or virtual world. The method of implementing crowd 
simulation is different from single agent simulation. Benesh (1986) and Roloff (1981) defined a 
crowd as: ÒA large group of individuals in the same physical environment sharing a common 
goal and may act in a different way than when they are aloneÓ [4]. Crowd simulation involves 
a comprehensive knowledge of each area: For example, many physical, psychological and 
social factors [6] were added into crowd control. In addition, variety needs for agent?s 
appearance, pose, behaviour, animation and reaction to events also have to be concerned. Soraia 
Raupp Musse, Branislav Ulicny and Amaury Aubel (2004) propose another perspective of 
crowd simulation [10]. They classify crowd simulation according to the goals of different 
crowd. There are four goals representing the mainstream applications of crowd simulation: 
Entertainment, crowd motion simulation, populating collaborative virtual environments and 
behaviour modelling of crowds. Suiping Zhou, Dan Chen et al. (2010) also gives us a detailed, 
deep analysis of crowd classification based on crowd size and time scale [6]. For example, our 
project on sports games (Entertainment industry) belongs to ãshort-term? zone and its crowd

size ranges from Òsmall-mediumÓ (tens to hundreds) to ÒhugeÓ (thousands or more). Figure 3 
shows the classification of crowd model under above criteria. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Classification of crowd models. Source: Ref. [6]. 
 
Crowd research has been categorized by model design approaches. There are two main 
directions [6, 10]. One research field, which mainly works on the movement and flowing trend 
of crowd, treats a crowd as an object of study. Chenney, S. et al discuss the representation work 
of two mainstream models in this area [14, 15]. One is defined as flow-based approach. The 
other is particle-based approach. These two approaches both involve physical and mathematical 
calculation. The principle of [14] is that although each virtual human is treated as an individual 
model, they are still implemented homogenously. The other work [15] further indicates that 
crowd movements and actions are controlled by mathematical, physical parameters. In general, 
these works can not be defined as ÒautonomousÓ or ÒintelligentÓ model design. The other 
research field is agent-based system (ABS). It is dominant at present crowd research area and 
has gained much progress with increasing development of CPU and GPU. Agent-based model 
involves with various behaviour rules (path planning, collision avoidance, navigation) and 
autonomous reactions to different events. In addition, many complex cognitive features are 
being developed including memory, stress and consciousness [2].

2.1.3 Four model approaches 
 
The two fields mentioned above can be classified into four crowd modelling approaches. And 
each approach provides a fundamental framework for crowd simulation. After a comparison of 
different approaches, we will gain a basic understanding of how to apply appropriate model and 
algorithm to crowd simulation in our project. Four major approaches, Flocking system, Particle 
system, Hybrid system and Agent-based system are discussed below: 
 
Flocking system, where a crowd is processed as a whole, is based on physical models. It was 
first applied into a computer evacuation program EVACNET 4 (Francis and Kisko 1984). And 
then Flow tiles [14], based on a velocity-field design, provides a better way to solve flocking 
simulation. Figure 3 gives a basic idea about velocity field and one application used in 
simulating stream. Fluid design is appropriate for simulating environment with hundreds and 
thousands of people. However, fluid design is hard to simulate specific details as desired [16]. 
It is mainly contributed to dense and large-scale crowd flow.

Flow embedded in an application, used to drive leaves 
   in the river. (down) Source: Ref. [14]. 
 
Particle system treats each agent in the crowd as homogeneous. It was first introduced to solve 
aggregate motion of animals like a flock of birds, a school of fish, etc [24]. In this system by 
setting up distributed behaviour model and physics rules, each unit (a particle) has its own 
perception in a dynamic scene. This non-hierarchy structure for crowd modelling is designed 
under force field and mathematical rules [15]. With the development of crowd simulation, now

the boundary between particle system and agent-based model becomes more obscure [6]; 
Figure 5 gives an illustration of the simulation of boid flocks in particle system.

  Source: Ref. [24]. 
 
Hybrid system is an integration of flocking system and particle systems. It involves both 
physical forces (flow fluids) and pre-defined rules [6].  
 
Agent-based system is the most advanced and cutting-edge research area of crowd modelling 
and simulation in recent years. Many traditional tools can not satisfy developers? increasing 
needs on crowd simulation. The main difference between agent-based system and other systems 
is the adaptive algorithm and complex behaviour rules applied in agent-based model which 
makes each individual more intelligent and autonomous. Figure 6 is a detailed description of 
agent-based model used in electric power market [11].

Several labs like Crowd Dynamics, MRL@NYU, VMASC, CHMS@UPenn, are focusing on 
different areas of agent-based system. VRlab is one of the leading labs in real-time virtual 
human research. Entertainment industry has adopted many crowd simulation technologies from 
VRlab [6]. Vicrowd which is the main work of agent-based framework is also from VRlab.

2.2 Content of the project 
 
2.2.1 Behaviour model design 
 
In our project, there are three fundamental levels in behaviour model: crowd, group and 
individual. Our model is a hierarchy-based model. Each character has its own behaviour and 
emotion. Without any trigger event or external control, an agent is still able to behave on its 
own autonomously. But this does not mean that they don?t have group behaviours. When the 
system finds events triggered or receives external instruction from user, it will distribute related 
behaviour into each character according to behavioural rules. Although each agent is 
independent, they can still form a team, a group to have collaborative behaviours.  
 
Generally, on a crowd level, behavioural rules are often set in advance, which forms a basic 
structure for model simulation. This makes it possible for group with various sizes to get 
control parameters from crowd. A group can be represented by many ways like: (1) a leader 
could be designed whose behaviour was followed by others [1]. (2) there is no leader but people 
in the same group have same team label. Autonomous group can be guided by external control 
which helps agents react to events. Individual, an agent, who stores his innate behaviour, also 
adopts the behaviour of its group behaviours. Based on this feature it is feasible to model 
different groups like families, lovers, etc. Such a flexible control over crowd allows us to 
generate behaviours according to different application and constrains, which means this 
structure, can be used as an extension or improvement of other crowd simulation project. This 
model offers different degrees of behaviour control including: pre-defined behaviours, rules 
control and guided control. Pre-defined behaviours are programmed (scripted) behaviours 
which were embedded in crowd model before simulation. Rules are those script functions 
which were trigged by specified event. Guided control emphasizes external control. This type 
of behaviour-author-tool control is extensible and flexible for crowd deign. 
 
Moreover, this type of model can also reduce conflicts between different levels of control when 
multiple orders were sent to agents. For example, when scripted behaviours (programmed 
behaviours) control an agent who is clapping for a nice goal, guided control is able to allow the 
character not to clap without closing or constraining scripted behaviours (e.g. looking around, 
keep quiet, idle). Another example is: A spectator has some innate behaviour like watching 
games and talking to others. When a team wins (event occurs), he can still talk (innate 
behaviours) associated with standing up (reaction of event) [1]. 
 
2.2.2 Behaviour Research 
 
Behaviour, namely innate attribute of each agent, is part of important implementation of in our 
crowd simulation. Generally, it can be divided into three parts: physical, social, psychological 
factors [6]. In shooting films and making crowd for background in games, physical factors like 
orientation, walking speed and gesture needs to be considered. In recent years, many games like 
Assassins Greed: brother hood [18], L.A. Niore [2011] are adding social, psychological factors 
Crowd Spectator Simulation For Sports Games 
 
15 
 
into Non-player-characters (e.g. pedestrians, creatures) to provide more interaction for players 
with virtual environment. 
 
Then physical factor which involves with different actions, path finding and collision avoidance 
is discussed based on VICROWD model. It is feasible to control the talk, chatting and any basic 
behaviour of spectator by using scripted control. And any reaction and triggered event related to 
sports (applaud, angry, lose, explosive) can also be controlled by external control method. In 
another word, external control has a higher priority than scripted control. Both ways directly 
influence the reaction and group behaviour. Innate behaviour holds the lowest priority. Figure 9 
shows the VICROWD behaviour priority. Some parts of this flexible strategy have been applied 
into our project.

2.3 Related work 
 
[26] gives an overview of the differences between linear and interactive animation and provides 
a detailed flow work of animation production. In this work a detailed explanation of a FSM 
provides a clearer view of how to embed FSM into animation application. [23] provides a 
behaviour model which is based on virtual agents in ancient Roma. External and individual 
behaviours are created for these agents. Agents in this model could react to both actors and the 
play. And their emotion state, social class are taken into consideration. [10] provides a basic 
group-based behaviour model which is created based on observing 7,405 informal groupings of 
people and 1458 people in various conditions. Its result gives a practical reference to simulate a 
crowd: 71% of all groups contain 2 individuals, 21% contains 3 individuals, 6% contains 4 
individuals and only 2% contains 5 or more people. Soraia Raupp Musse and Daniel Thalmann 
introduced a hierarchical model for crowd simulation, VICROWD [1]. The feature of 
VICROWD is its group-based structure, involving with intelligence, memory, goals and 
cognitive sense.  Hierarchical model is the core part of framework design. But it is still only one 
part of the whole project. Crowd simulation involves many parts of implementation [4, 9]: 
modelling, variation, behaviour setting, animating, rending, etc. [3] gives a detailed method of 
visualizing a large-scale number of pedestrian crowd and gives a clear framework of crowd 
simulation pre-processing including model templates, material database and motion database. 
This work provides a modified model which aims to improve the efficiency of simulating 
pedestrians in large-scale environment (thousands or more) in real-time applications. The work 
indicates that making different models and then sharing the same data with proper variations at 
run time is an efficient way to reduce memory cost. In this work the data of each character is 17 
MB including model template, motion and material database. A point-based method 
accelerating technique is introduced in [3] for rending issue. Furthermore, there are still many 
other works like 2D-image based solutions in [4, 19, 20]. But 3D visualization issues are still 
universal. [25]?s algorithm searches through each state of FSM. High-level state is represented 
as a library of character poses. A global planning technique helps arrange the sequence of a 
collection of motions. [4] utilizes the LOD(level of detail) and ROI(region of interest) to reduce 
calculation times. By calculating the distance from vertex to the camera, LOD indexes which 
represent different human template resolution are labelled on each individual. ROI, region of 
interest, applies different motion planning methods to different templates. The higher the ROI 
value of the character is, the more complicated planning algorithm is applied to the character. In 
the contrast, lower ROI value saves more memory usage during simulation but the character has 
a more simple behaviour.   
 
MASSIVE [22] is originated from WETA digital studio. It was first created for the epic battle 
scenes in Lord of the Rings Trilogy and then was used in many films [12]. Common techniques 
like A* algorithm and FSM [17] are adopted in simulation [6]. Two main crowd simulation 
products are provided by MASSIVE: Massive PrimeTM  and Massive JetTM  (Simplified 
Version). They both provide friendly user interfaces like Motion Tree Editor, Brain Editor, 
Cloth Editor and Action Editor to facilitate artists and visual effects professionals. Some main 
plug-ins in MASSIVE like Motion Tree Editor and Action Editor are still good references to 
my project.

LEGION SDUDIO, an agent-based pedestrian simulation software, owns a huge database over 
1000 hours video footage with more than 8 million pedestrian movements and spanning 14 
cities over the world. It is very powerful for simulating pedestrians especially on path finding 
and collision avoidance. Furthermore, SIMULEX, which is designed for simulating evacuation 
from specific building, is an agent-based software from Integrated Environmental Solutions 
(IES) Ltd. A.I PLANT, from PRESAGIS, also involving with path-planning and collision 
avoidance, provides agent-based crowd simulation in virtual environment. The way to collect 
data of above software is a good for simulating spectator crowds in my project.

Chapter 3 Project Design 
 
3.1 Overview of framework 
 
The core aim of our project is to design an efficient and easy behaviour model for production 
tools which help animators set up any spectator scene in sports. Except the core aim, we also 
produce a simple production tool which is embedded in Maya. The friendly user interface with 
few external controls is very easy to learn. An animator without programming experience can 
also manage it quickly. The only thing he has to do is just clicking on some option buttons. This 
flexible and easily-control system is easy to be maintained and embedded into other crowd 
populating works. As shown in Figure 8, our project mainly includes three parts: 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8. Framework of our work.  
 
Pre-processing: Before the run-time simulation, some data like motion data, human template, 
material, and environment setup must be prepared in advance [3]. These processes speed up 
run-time simulation and save a large amount of time. By setting up a motion library, we are 
able to provide various motions for the template during simulation. For each agent any motion 
could be easily imported and scheduled by simulation system. Human template also should be 
Crowd Spectator Simulation For Sports Games 
 
19 
 
modelled first to save the modelling time during simulation. Then the system could pick up any 
human template according to type demand.  
 
Run-time Processing: During the run-time process, by importing specified models, the system 
resizes each character based on default rules. Then motion data are imported for creating virtual 
human behaviours and actions. A behaviour generator is constructed to help system to 
automatically search for the next motion based on behaviour rules and events until the end of 
simulation.  
 
User Input: There are only few parameters need to be transferred into the system: The user is 
able to set his own preference on simulation duration and crowd size; Specified model needs to 
be displayed in the scene; Setting up the  age group of crowd like children, adult or mix. This 
means user can easily set up a scene with crowds of children participating a sports game in an 
elementary school or a scene with crowd of adults taking their children joining in an Olympic 
games in a big stadium; setting up teams of fans there: If there is only one team of fans there, 
when an event like kicking a goal happens, all the fans will cheer for the goal. They are treated 
like fans from the same team. However, if two-teams-of-fans option is set up, fans from 
respective team will support their own team; LOD can be turned on or off by the user according 
to different situations.     
 
3.1.1 Process of system  
 
The main procedure of our project is described as below:  
 
1. Get input information from user. 
2. Initialise the scene. 
3. Generate crowd. 
4. Resize each character?s skeleton.  
5. Set up the default pose for each individual which helps import motion sequence later. 
6. Use behaviour generator to set the basic information of crowd motion. 
7. For each character, execute the chooseMotionClip() procedure, system will 
automatically pick up various motion from motion library 
8. By analyzing external and internal parameters, system searches for next motion 
automatically 
9. Loop until finish scheduling all the motion for each character. 
 
The whole process is shown in figure 9:

3.1.2 Distribution of crowd 
  
The first step for creating the crowd is the distribution of the crowd in a scene. The seats in the 
scene are generated automatically and then user is able to choose the allocation for each 
audience. In Maya when same objects imported into the scene, each object?s name is assigned 
to a different suffix. The system has to parse the suffix of each seat index to distribute each 
audience. In figure 10, we can see a crowd is created in the left picture. And in column 1 and 
column 3, there are no people generated. The right picture shows the corresponding user input. 
Because the whole simulation is done by laptop, there are some limits to the amount of 
processing. In our work, due to this factor, we can not load thousands of characters. But 
hundreds of people are already enough for test. In a word, our system would scale to any 
number of spectators if given enough processing power. In this scalable system, users can set 
up from small-size (hundreds) to large-size (thousands) of crowd according to their own 
preferences.

We should loop for each character. And parse the chair index and then execute the distribution 
of a crowd:  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An instance of a model in Maya behaves the exactly same as the original model. This means if 
an audience is set up as an instance, there must be another one behave the exact same as him. 
Figure 11 shows that when the original model lifts his right hand, the instance of this model 
also lifts his right hand. Although this technique could be tolerated in many cases in film and 
game production, in our case, in order to give the maximum flexibility of control crowd, 
instance is not used. Instead, when we set up a new human model from human template, we 
copy all the upstream nodes besides the selected nodes (also including the connections). This 
means the new model has all the functions of original model. In our project, we don't have 
effort to focusing on making many delicate motion clips into the motion library. It is animators? 
work. So there are not enough gestures and actions shown in our project. However, in our 
project, as long as there were enough motion data created by artists or relative professionals 
stored in motion library, each agent could have his own distinctive behaviours and actions 
rather than repetitive motion from same human template.

3.1.3 Motion research 
 
 
 
Figure 12. Applause and cheering scene of real crowd 
 
Relative research has been done on the observation of audience-performer interaction. Most of 
the motion patterns (shown in figure 12) in different types of scenarios have been analyzed 
from physical and emotional aspects [20]. In our project, in order to get a basic understanding 
of spectator behaviour representation, we mainly use two methods to study the behaviour 
representation. First, we study papers which are related behaviour, audience interaction and 
Crowd Spectator Simulation For Sports Games 
 
24 
 
concert performance analysis. Second, we study how spectators behave in different 
circumstances by watching various videos from website. In most situations, spectators with 
fundamental culture knowledge are clear about the timing of cheering, clapping, etc. But some 
factors like performance type, performance environment might have different crowd responses. 
Research has shown that government speech has less motion types like applause types than a 
music live show. In addition, music concerts also have different types of audience motions 
(behaviours): A rock or R&B performance motion model can not be directly adapted to a 
classical concert behaviour model.  
 
Some basic rules of audiences are discussed below: 
1. It takes less than 1 second from the start of a ÒcheerÓ action to its maximum exciting 
level. 
2. During the performance, idle or stand motions of a crowd look more randomly in sports 
game than other performances like those in concerts. 
3. If more than twenty five percent of people in a crowd begin to clap, the whole crowd 
will quickly clap together.  
4. The more excited, the more various of one?s movement 
 
Generally, there are mainly 3 common-used spectator behaviours: (1) applause (2) cheer (3) 
unstructured body movement. From the above research, a classification of the behaviour in 
some common performances is given in figure 13 [7]:

3.1.4 Crowd reaction research 
 
In an agent-based simulation environment, agents? behaviours are often triggered by a set of 
rules. Here the behaviours refer to behaviour models and rules refer to emotion model [11].  
Social, psychological factors of audience crowd in public are investigated in our work. Gary 
Lupyan and Ilya Rifkin provide a general outline of the personal, social, psychological factors 
of audiences at a chamber music festival [8]. It details the motivation, intention, temperament 
and habit of audience on both individual level and group level. Many actions and interactions of 
audiences are described in detail, which provides a detailed reference of natural crowd 
behaviours to our project. Some actions and events can be directly used into crowd spectator 
simulation. Soraia Raupp Musse, Branislav Ulicny and Amaury Aubel propose a design model 
for applause, which can be directly applied to crowd design [10]. The author defines two 
concepts: benefit and cost. This ÒbenefitÓ is proportional to the performance and impressiveness 
of an event. The cost is defined as embarrassment cost and physical cost: Embarrassment cost is 
an Òembarrassment thresholdÓ parameter. It shows the degree of each agent?s willing to 
applause. The physical cost means the applause relevance to time. Generally, as time elapses, 
the proportion of people who are clapping decreases. The idea here is simple: The benefit 
(expressiveness) is set as b, and two costs were set as c1 and c2. Agent claps when b > c1 + c2. 
In opposite, B < c1 + c2. Figure 14 shows how impressiveness of event is related to duration of 
applause and proportion clapping. Also two hypotheses [10] are confirmed by analysis of real 
time recording of audience performance. One indicates that applause often starts very quick but 
stops slow. Another one is that if one?s applause is ignored by others, which means no one 
follows his applause, then the clapping will stop immediately. In sum, on a social and 
psychological level, this work gives a very clear view of how to simulate spectators in public.

3.2 Behaviour model 
 
In our project, crowd are formed by groups: It is completely scripted and based on behavioural 
rules. Crowd includes information which is embedded in each group. Group consists of agents: 
the size is decided by the information from crowd. It also can be scripted and guided. And they 
can react to specified events based on different level of expressiveness index during the whole 
simulation. Each agent just acts according to the parameters passed from group.  
 
As described in Figure 15, the methods for setting audience behaviour are scripted control and 
rules control respectively. The scripted control is embedded in crowd structure which means if 
no event happened or no external control existed, crowd will behave under scripted control 
without any other influence until the simulation ends. The external control includes some 
events or some other behaviour related rules. If events happened or user gave an external 
command, some original behaviour or motion of agents will be replaced, and then agents will 
behave according to external control until the trigger event ends or simulation ends.

3.2.1 FSM 
 
3.2.1.1 Introduction 
 
FSM, namely finite-state machine, is very efficient on modelling various problems in many 
research areas such as EDA, communications protocol, biology, linguistics, etc. This 
behavioural model has already been widely used to design software in crowd simulation. [26] 
gives a comprehensive illustration of how a structure of FSM is designed in animation 
production. A FSM system contains a finite number of nodes and connections. Here nodes are 
the states we will discuss in our project. And connections, namely transitions, are a set of 
instructions to be implemented once some events are triggered or some conditions are met.  
 
The CFSM (crowd finite state machine) designed in our work is in charge of each individual?s 
motion arrangement. Figure 16 shows part of CFSM in our project: Each circle means a motion 
state. And each motion state has its own clips which are shown inside the blue circle (in this 
graph only cheer state?s clips are shown because of picture space). An arrow means a transition 
between two actions.  
 
A state in BFSM is represented as a node which contains all its children information (some 
including itself as child). The whole simulation time is defined by user. Then the system will 
automatically expand the motion sequences within the specified time period based on external 
and internal control. This means character?s motion sequence is created and extended by 
continuing finding path in the motion-tree based on behaviour rules until the time is due.  
 
The start state is the default pose which we set up before the run-time processing. Then as the 
run-time simulation starts, in this graph, the start state transits to sit state. And then depending 
on different events or some external controls the state will switch to turn left, turn right or stand 
state. Generally, each state from our CFSM can be regarded as a high-level motion. And as the 
cheer_1 to cheer_4 clips which are contained in each state are low-level motions. By 
scheduling a linear sequence of clips according to various conditions and constrains, an agent?s 
behaviour is finally produced from CFSM.

28 
 
 
 
 
Figure 16. Crowd finite state machine. 
 
3.2.1.2 Transition of FSM 
 
In order to have a more flexible control on these states, each state only has a length of 10 
frames. If a state consists of very complex movements, this state will be divided into several 
parts. This method not only provides more flexibility on BFSM, but also saves the memory 
space of clip library. In our work, the cheer state of a spectator is actually cut into three parts: 
Arm_up, cheer, Arm_down. For example, if a character wants to perform a cheer action, first 
the system will schedule an Arm_up state to this character and then the Arm_up state will 
automatically searches for cheer state and transits to this state. Furthermore this character might 
want to cheer for certain duration of time. Therefore system allows cheer state to last for a 
specified period of time by controlling its repeating times. At last when this character does not 
want to cheer, an Arm_down state is imported into character to finish the whole motion. This is 
a cheer motion cycle. After the cheer cycle, the character returns to the stand state and starts 
another state based on behaviour rules.  
 
In order to make the transition of CFSM fluid, each clip must have a default pose at the start 
and end of its duration.  Figure 17 describes a fluid transition of a cheer state. In order to have a 
fluid cheer motion, character should first transit from Arm_up state to default pose. The end 
frame of Arm_up state and the start frame of the cheer state share the same default pose. The 
transition from cheer to Arm_up is the same. In conclusion, default pose is a good method for 
fluid transition between different states in CFSM.

3.2.1.3 Code implementation  
 
In order to set up each autonomous agent, a self-searching structure is designed for behaviour 
generation. By passing template type, motion type and timing parameters into this structure, 
system is able to process each clip?s attributes data information and then calculates the start and 
end frame of each clip on the timeline. Then based on these information, the system is able to 
arrange the motions. After receiving the timing information of each clip, system starts to search 
the next motion for each individual from the motion graph. Finally it gets the next motion type 
and returns this parameter into the nested structure to start another clip scheduling process.  
This is the basic principle of how the system schedules each state. The code below shows the 
self-searching structure of our system.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Crowd Spectator Simulation For Sports Games 
 
30 
 
 
 
The function searchForNextMotion() returns a set of motions that audience could choose to 
perform next. All the motion information comes from CFSM. [25] provides a method that sets 
weights index to different states: For example, jogging-and-turning(JAT) often has more cost 
than jogging forward(JF);Jumping requires more effort than JAT and JF; Stop and waiting 
motion are set to the highest weights. By this method the state which has more weight is less 
likely to be chosen by the system. Base on weight-based algorithm, our new weighted-based 
algorithm has been designed. We set weight index for both states and the clips in each state. 
This method provides a more flexible control on crowd behaviour. 
 
3.2.2 Behaviour variety 
 
Various behaviours are classified into different levels. On the first (low) level, each audience 
has a list of basic motion clips which can be called as innate behaviours. The basic motion clips 
are the ÒinbornÓ behaviour of each individual. They can idle, look around, talk, etc.  When 
these scripted behaviours are applied, crowd automatically distributes these behaviours among 
the spectators. There is no need of external control throughout simulation on this level. On the 
second (high) level, rules and events have been applied. They have higher priority than innate 
behaviours on the first level. This kind of structure gives a clear priority instruction on agents 
when they receive various controls at the same time.  
 
In order to make audience not repetitive and emotionless, two possible solutions has been 
provided by [26]. One method is adding multiple clips into the same state, rather than making 
one clip for one state. The other method is adding procedural noise to the state to produce 
variety. Two solutions are both applicable in our project. After comparison, we choose the first 
method. Because in Maya, the change of each motion will directly reflect on the change of its 
animation curve. Thus, in order to make more varieties on a motion, we are actually making 
more varieties on its animation curves. But each motion?s animation curve is encapsulated in 
each clip. During the whole simulation, there are tens or hundreds of clips needed to be 
instanced on the timeline for each character set. More importantly, there are hundreds or 
global proc int chooseMotionClip(string $charClipSet, string $motionType, int 
$startTimeFrame, int $allFrameLength) 
{ 
ÉÉ 
       $calculateStart = `getAttr ($clipName[0] + ".startFrame")`; 
       $calculateLength1 = `getAttr ($clipName[0] + ".sourceStart")`; 
       $calculateLength2 = `getAttr ($clipName[0] + ".sourceEnd")`; 
       $calculateLength = $calculateLength2 - $calculateLength1; 
       $endTimeFrame = $calculateLength + $calculateStart; 
ÉÉ 
             $motion = searchForNextMotion($charClipSet, $motion); 
             chooseMotionClip($charClipSet, $motion, $endTimeFrame, $allFrameLength); 
} 
 
Crowd Spectator Simulation For Sports Games

thousands of character sets in a crowd. Thus it is not very convenient to add procedure noise on 
the animation curves. The first method discussed below is more space-saving and efficient.  
 
All the characters in this project import motions from the same FSM. Thus in order to add 
variety into the crowd, in each set (state) system has several similar clips which share the same 
goal but with subtle differences. Figure 18 shows a part of our clip library. From the picture you 
can see each motion has been added with four different motion clips. They have their own 
indexes ÒoneÓ to ÒfourÓ which is convenient for searching. The system assigns these motions to 
each individual randomly or based on some rules. That is one of the method to add variety to 
the crowd. 
 
 
 
Figure 18. A part of our clip library 
 
3.2.3 Reaction to event 
 
Crowd reaction is controlled by global parameters. A crowd is able to react to any event when 
relative event signal arrives. Figure 19 shows how the crowd react to the event. This is an event 
that when the announcer exclaims someone kicks a goal, the whole crowd react to this event 
immediately to cheer for the goal. This is done by controlling the timing information of each 
clip. In the left picture, before frame 120, no one would like to cheer, they are just watching 
games. You can see from the timeline no announcer?s voice appears. On the right, we can see 
after frame 120, when the announcer begins to shout and being excited (you could see from the 
sound volume), the event triggers cheer motion. This means a cheer signal is sent to each 
character and then all of them begin to cheer.

Crowd Spectator Simulation For Sports Games

According to different embarrassment level, people would behave differently. This means 
different events might have different influences on audiences. Some events with lowest 
excitement only make few people cheer. Events with middle level of excitement make more 
people cheer and clap. And those with high level excitement not only trigger agents to cheer, 
but also make people jump and do more exciting motions. In our project, global parameters are 
added for emotion and events control. For example, the global embarrassment parameter is able 
to control clap duration of the crowd. If the embarrassment value is very high, the crowd will 
not like to clap or clap for only a short period of time. In contrast, lower embarrassment value 
leads to longer period of time for clapping. The picture (up) in Figure 20 shows at frame 250, 
crowd are still cheering for the goal. This means, with a lower embarrassment index value, 
crowd cheers for a longer time. The picture (Down) shows at frame 250, crowd already stop for 
cheering. This means, with a higher embarrassment index, crowd cheers for a shorter time. 
Global event parameters are also embedded in the scripted behaviour. Different events have 
different variables and different weights. When the system searches for the next motion of each 
agent, it will always check out whether some events happen. Then system can decide what the 
next motion is for the agent. The sample code below gives a simple demonstration of how the 
global event and embarrassment parameters control the clips on the timeline.

                                                           Crowd cheer for a short period. 
                                                           $embarrasment = 1. (down)

3.2.4 Interaction 
 
With the development of CG industry, interactive animation technique would gradually replace 
traditional linear animation technique. However, interactions between agents are more difficult 
to generate than traditional linear animation. For example, when we want to set up a hug 
motion for two friends in the crowd, two matched motions from two individuals should be 
under a precise time control and adaptable to any subtle variation during the simulation. Failing 
on synchronizing this animation task would lead to agents? arms or heads cross through each 
other. With the deep research on procedural animation technique, interaction between virtual 
humans becomes more and more plausible. This kind of close interactive activity is inevitably 
needed in crowd simulation because people are very likely to engage in social and emotional 
communication. 
 
Interaction in crowd simulation needs a complex structure of motion library. In our project, our 
aim is not to make a very complex motion library. Creation of a complex motion library should 
be done by the corporation between programmer and animator. Hence in our work a simple 
interaction structure is provided. We regard a small group of people who are interacting with 
each other as a single entity. They get the same index which means they are in the same group. 
And then system is able to import synchronized animations into this entity. Thus the spectators 
in the crowd could be divided into different groups according to this kind of external control. 
When a team wins, different groups of people behave differently. Figure 21 illustrates when a 
team wins, one group of people cheer for the winner, while the other groups of people don not 
cheer for them.

           global int $embarrassment;

                 {  
                    Set longer time for cheer 
                 } 
              else if ( $embarrassment == 1 ) 
                 { 
                    Set shorter time for cheer 
                 }

3.3 Motion arrangement  
 
3.3.1 Motion library 
 
In Maya, Trax editor is a powerful tool for arranging motions for one or more characters. We 
could just use mouse to drag specified clips into each character?s timeline to make them active. 
However, when we are facing thousands or ten thousands of crowd, it is impossible to 
manipulate each character by hand. Thus we need to choose a programming language which 
could be used to manage the motion library. Mel (Maya embedded language) is chosen because 
its platform-independent and efficiency feature. In Maya, every object is treated as a node.  
Figure 22 gives an overview of the nodes we used in our project and next we will discuss the 
connections between each node and how we utilize these nodes to manipulate crowd motion. 
  
 
 
Figure 22. Node used in motion library. 
 
Figures 22 shows how a single character in a crowd connected with a motion library. We can 
see from this figure that there are seven nodes in this graph.  
 
The two nodes on the top nimCurveTL1, animCurveTA3 represent the two example source 
motion clips in our project. Their arrows pointing to character1Clips1, the motion library node 
means these clips are included in the motion library.  
 
Crowd Spectator Simulation For Sports Games 
 
37 
 
Clip1 shown in the graph has an arrow pointing to the character1Scheduler1. It means the 
instanced clip which is instanced from source motion clip and then scheduled onto the timeline 
for each character.  
 
The Character1clips1, which represents motion library node, manages source motion data and 
their motion curves. Each motion clip is represented by an animation curve node which is 
linked with motion library node, which means we can also change the motion data by adjusting 
the animation curve. The motion library node can analyse its attached motion data to get their 
attributes without calculating current time. That is very convenient for our work to schedule 
motion sequences. The source motion data has their own attributes including Start Frame, Pre 
Cycle, Post Cycle, Scale, etc.  
 
The character1scheduler1 is the clip scheduler for character1. It manages the placement and 
blending of character1?s motion clips. From the figure we can see an arrow pointing from 
character1clips1 to character1scheduler1, which means this clip scheduler has been connected 
to motion data library. All the motion data in clip library is able to be instanced unlimited times 
by the clip scheduler. This saves much space for animators to store motion data because some 
cycle motion like clap, cheer can be repeatedly utilized rather than setting up a new one when 
needed again and again. Although these instanced data share the same source motion 
information stored in the motion library, we can change their attributes with the help of clip 
scheduler when we place each clip.  
 
In a word, motion library manages original motion data and the clip scheduler arranges 
instanced motion data. This means we should first produce raw motion data in the motion 
library, and then use clip scheduler to place raw motion data on specified time period. And one 
individual can only link to one motion data library and one clip scheduler. Figure 23 shows 
source clips like stand (Index), cheer (Index), etc have all been instanced for many times.  
 
 
 
Figure 23. Every source clip is instanced for many times.

3.3.2 Absolute and relative motion sequence 
 
As discussed above, after distributing each audience to each specified position, the system then 
starts to import motions based on behaviour rules into each agent. Source clips, which are 
shared by all the agents in a crowd, are made by exporting motions from model template. The 
model template has its own world and local coordinate information which also have been 
transferred into each exported clip. When we apply the source clips into each audience, the 
clips in each audience still preserve the information from original template. Thus an agent 
whose root position is at (a1, b1, c1) cannot have right actions because source clips are 
originally produced at the (a0, b0, c0). As a result there will be some exaggerated stretch or 
bend on the body.  
 
To solve this issue, we need to enable clips applied to each individual using its local coordinate 
in the scene, not the world coordinate. In another word, the clips instanced from source clips 
should have a ÒrelativeÓ property rather than an ÒabsoluteÓ property. Figure 24 is a comparison 
of the result between skeleton applied into relative and absolute properties. The picture (up) 
shows two characters have the same motion at the same frame. The charSet3 has a ÒrelativeÓ 
attribute for its motion clips. The other charSet4 is ÒabsoluteÓ. The left figure (down) shows the 
character behaves well after being set a relative property while the right shows the result of 
absolute properties. You can clearly see the stretch of the elbow and skeleton scales back to the 
original human template. This is not the result we want. Therefore during the scheduling 
process on the timeline, an Òall relativeÓ attribute should be added during programming in the 
instanced clip.

Figure  24. A comparison of relative and absolute properties 
 
 
 
3.3.3 Transition 
 
A robust, fluent and rapid transition from one state to another state is very important for agents 
expressing exact emotions during specified events. In another word, when a series of events 
happen, an individual should have the mechanism, the ability of choosing the correspondent 
actions which have to commence.  
 
A robust transition needs to have a comprehensive motion graph, a detailed FSM. This can be 
done by carefully designing the sequence of each state. A rapid transition means when an event 
happens, the agent will try to finish the current motion cycle as soon as possible and then 
change to specified motion. Also a direct interpolation of new pose is also possible but it will 
clip -copy ($motion + $motionIndex + ":" + $motion + $motionIndex + "Source");  
            $clipName = `clip -pasteInstance -sc 1 -startTime $startTime -ar $charClipSet`;   
Crowd Spectator Simulation For Sports Games 
 
40 
 
lead to some motion discontinuity. For example, when an agent clap cycle is still not finished, a 
new event which has an instruction of making the agent stop clapping happens. A robust 
transition will first finish the clap cycle and then begin to execute the new motion cycle. While 
a rapid transition will stop the clap cycle immediately and load the new motion cycle. Although 
the former can reduce motion discontinuity, it produces some lag to agent?s reaction. While the 
latter also has its disadvantage: although it can react at the exact time, some improper action or 
gesture will be generated due to the rapid switch. Thus our project tries to strike a balance 
between the two contradictory factors. After carrying through some tests on motion clips and 
our FSM model, we put forward two solutions: (1) we cut down each clip?s duration to reduce 
the lag time. (2) Some motions with relative longer duration are broken down into smaller parts. 
For instance, as mentioned above, the cheer state is divided into three parts: Arm_up, cheer, 
Arm_down. As a result, in our system, the lag is less than 10 frames on average. Figure 23 
shows a part of our motion arrangement before the simulation. You can find each clip is cut 
down into around 10 frames. And big clips have been cut down to satisfy different combination 
of clips during the simulation.

3.4 Virtual model representation research and LOD 
 
In our work, rendering process is done by the existing render engine in Maya. However, we 
could also increase rendering time by improving rendering algorithm. This work might be 
considered as future work of our project. In this section we will discuss about our research on 3 
levels of detail used in human model representation.  
 
Human template is the basic representation of a virtual human which consists of skeleton and 
joints covered with thousands of triangle mesh. It comprises several models for different 
resolution levels and various appearances to produce different various types of human. 
Animation sequence information is also included in human template. In short, all the virtual 
individuals in the crowd are originated from human templates. So a large number of meshes 
mean a huge volume of information which needs to be processed in each frame. Although, in 
recent years, graphic card indeed develops rapidly, there are still some constraints. Many 
researchers still have to consider the trade-off between render cost and quality. Based on Daniel 
Thalmann?s theory, two important sections of model representation are below [2, 4]. Besides 
the human templates in crowd simulation, rending is also a core part for model visualization. 
Three main techniques of acceleration technologies for rending are:  Culling (visibility, 
occlusion), Levels of Detail (geometry, animation) and image-based rending (HW layers, 
imposters). Considering large numbers of polygons in spectator crowd, we often view the 
crowd as a whole. Image-based rending is more suitable for rending large numbers of people in 
a virtual environment [19]. 
 
3.4.1 Deformable mesh 
 
Deformable mesh, enveloping tens of joints of a human body, has both advantages and 
disadvantages in crowd simulation [4]. 
(1) Advantages 
1. Flexible animation. Any slight movement like grin or clenching can be animated. 
2. The mesh consists of many vertices, which following the joints movements. The 
changes between each frame can be only referred to those deforming vertices. In another 
word, this kind of frame information is cheap to store. 
3. Procedural animation and blending are feasible by using based on this approach. 
(2) Disadvantages 
1. Only suitable for tens or hundreds people animation. 
2. Used under constrains like camera distance.

42 
 
3.4.2 Rigid mesh 
 
Rigid mesh and imposter techniques are able to provide faster speed of rending. However, the 
camera distance needs to be further than that of deformable mesh. In addition, procedure 
animation is not available here and slight movements can not be achieved. 
 
The apparent difference between rigid mesh and deformable mesh is the pre-processing 
procedure. In the deformable mesh, the animation sequence information is handled by GPU. 
However, rigid mesh handles vertex information in CPU rather than in GPU, which increasing 
speed considerably during the rending process [5]. 
 
3.4.3 Imposter 
 
Tecchia F., Loscos C. give a detailed previous works of image-based acceleration technology 
[19]. Imposter, a less detailed representation, is a dominant image-base acceleration technology 
for large-scale virtual crowd simulation. Generally the rendering system produces a fake image 
that rotating to the camera. A virtual human is often divided into different parts based on body 
part. All the information of imposter is generated in a hidden buffer and then copied to texture 
memory. Figure 25 gives a comparison of 3D deformable mesh and imposter. From the pictures 
we can find the clear difference between the two methods. In sum, deformable mesh has a more 
realistic look than imposter. In my project, it is more preferable to choose the former method.

3.4.4 LOD 
 
With the increasing demand on crowd scene in film and game industry, hundreds and thousands 
of characters in a scene is very common in a crowd simulation task. Thus when facing a large 
quantity of information which needs to be processed during simulation, simplified and efficient 
method might be utilized to relieve this situation.   
 
LOD technique is often used in crowd simulation to reduce the complexity of model 
representation. David Kasik, Andreas Dietrich et al. (2008) give a detailed classification within 
model visualization field [21]. This article shows LOD has three implementation methods for 
LOD: discrete, progressive and continuous models. The discrete model and progressive model 
both have one advantage: they can handle a large object which spanning a very long distance 
from the viewer or camera. However, these two methods are not efficient enough to handle 
audiences in crowd simulation. Figure 26 shows examples of discrete and progressive LOD. 
Jonathan Mam, Barbara Yersin, Daniel Thalmann also proposed a new method to process 
crowd visualization [4]. A LOD Selector which is based on the LOD has been designed. They 
introduced a new parameter ROI (regions of different interests). Based on ROI, each agent can 
be assigned to different motion planning rules. LOD Selector combines LOD and ROI together 
to achieve to most efficient-cost visualization.

In our project, we adopt the LOD selector technique. After we set up a camera, we can use the 
camera position and geometry position to calculate the distance between them and then decide 
which geometry should be rendered during rendering process. In our project, we are not able to 
spend time on modelling a perfect human model. Thus we get sample geometries of both lower 
and higher resolution to test our LOD function. During the test, the geometry of each individual 
switches to lower resolution and higher resolution automatically according to the distance from 
each person to the camera. By reducing the visual quality without being noticed by the audience, 
this method helps save rendering time and improves the software performance on populating a 
large-scale crowd. In figure 27, picture above shows when the distance is less than 10, the 
system automatically switches to higher resolution. The picture below shows when the distance 
is further than 10, low resolution geometry is displayed. In order to increase system processing 
speed, the code is not written in expression editor in the Maya crowd scene. They are all 
embedded in the original Mel file.

3.5 User interface 
 
Our production tool is embedded into Autodesk Maya 2010 environment. By clicking the shelf 
button shown in Figure 28, the script will automatically compile and run.  
 
 
 
                               Figure 28. The implementation button embedded into Maya 
 
The first window (shown in figure 29) asks user to input the row and column number of the 
crowd. With the input information, the scene will generate seats for the whole scene. Hundreds 
of people could be created in my laptop. But this scalable system can create thousands of or 
more agents if computational power is satisfied.

Then the second window (shown in figure 29) pops up. The user could import their desired 
model from the menu. And finally they need to set up their preference: the distribution of the 
crowd; the whole simulation time; choosing different age group to have different resizing 
parameters; fans from one team or two team (further can be extend to more groups of fans); 
Level of details on and off. Then after user presses the ÒcreateÓ button, the system will 
automatically generate the desired crowd.

Chapter 4 Visual improvement 
 
In chapter 3, we have implemented the most important part of our simulation: variety of 
behaviour, variety of actions. In our project, we mainly work on software algorithm and 
behaviour model structure. Aesthetics work like drawing delicate human skin texture, 
researching on human body organization is not our concern. These works should be improved 
by artists. In this section, we will give an overview of crowd variation. With our variation 
structure and a good understanding of human body proportion and texture editing, an artist can 
easily make a good visual effect on crowd.  
 
4.1 Colour variety 
 
In crowd simulation, many ãunique? virtual humans are needed to main virtual authenticity. It is 
impossible to design various templates for each agent and assign colourful, unique texture to 
each one. In addition, the space for storing such huge information is demanding. Thus it is 
reasonable and nature to have some techniques to create variety on template, texture and 
animation for crowd simulation. Generally, in crowd simulation there are three ways to create 
basic variety for human templates. The first is generating enough human templates for agents. 
Obviously, it is able to increase variety. However, it is still impossible to model templates for 
each agent in a large-scale virtual environment where there are hundreds, thousands or even 
more individuals. It will take huge memory space to store each template. Furthermore, 
modelling this templates need a lot of time and modelling skills. So based on several templates, 
the next step is to assign different texture and get different colour for each template. Figure 30 
shows the different templates appearances and the result after applying different texture and 
colours.  
 
 
 
Figure 30. Step 1: making different templates (Left)

        Source: Ref. [4].

Based on the RGB system, crowd system has already been able to produce various colours for 
templates. However, the result is not satisfactory in a very large-scale crowd simulation 
(thousands or more). Jonathan Mam, Barbara Yersin and Daniel Thalmann [2008] give a new 
method which involves HSB system to solve this problem in crowd simulation [4]. HSB has 
three perceptual variables: hue(H), saturation(S), bright(B). Which is more suitable for 
controlling constrains to specific parts of templates. It is easier to get skin colour with hue (only 
yellow and red) and no saturation(S) rather than a combination of R, G and B.

4.2 Body size variety 
 
In the film and game industry, spectator crowd in stadiums or arenas are not strict with 
individual appearance. While the whole crowd variation is the essential factor to create virtual 
crowds. By using script to edit different part of human body, it is feasible to create a more vivid 
crowd with various sizes [3]. This procedure gives a solution of setting up different human 
models (old, young, adult, boy, girl etc). Moreover, John Kundert-Gibbs, provides a more 
realistic way to make variation [9]: By giving random number of human part ratio, which 
concerns about the algorithm with joint setting of only one model, hundreds of different models 
can be created immediately.  In our work, a simple skeleton is set up for test. The user is able to 
import any type of human skeleton as they like to simulate the scene. A skeleton of one 
character is shown in figure 31. 
 
 
 
Figure 31. Character?s skeleton used in our work. 
 
In our work, by adjusting the joint of each character, we can set up a crowd scene of various 
sizes. This procedure is done before importing motion. After each character is imported into the 
scene, according to user input, system begins to generate resizing parameters which will be 
used during the scaling process. Then the system loops for each character in the scene and scale 
its? joints with the given scaling parameters. By scaling the pelvis joint, we can decide the 
height character?s upper body. By scaling elbow joint, we can change the length of arm. Figure 
32 shows all the controllable joint of one character. We could adjust any joint in this figure to 
achieve the type of figure we want.

51 
 
 
 
 
Figure 32. A list of scalable joints 
 
We run into a technical problem during the process of resizing. After we resize each character 
and then begin to import motion into each character. All the sizes of each character returns to 
the default size Ð the original template size. 
 
 
 
Figure 33. Setting up pose for each character.  
 
This is caused by the stored information in the motion library. Since all the pre-processed 
motions are made from the original human template. Thus when the motion clips are stored in 
the motion library, they also store the template?s size information including translation, rotating 
and scaling. Hence although each motion clip is set to Òall relativeÓ property as mentioned in 
section 3.3.2, because of lacking initialization information of each skeleton, The skeleton will 
changing according to the previous motion clip which is imported into the character. Thus it is a 
must to store the pose information to preserve the resizing result. Thus after the scaling 
procedure, we must set up a pose for each character to store the skeleton initialization

information. After that, no matter what kind of motion is imported, character will always scale 
based on the ÒrelativeÓ information.  The editor in Figure 33 shows eight poses are added at the 
0 frame (before the simulation). After we set poses for each character, eight characters in the 
scene all have their own different appearances.

 clipSchedule -start 0 -ra -in $poseName[0] (`character -q -sc $charSetName`);    
   ....... 
}

Chapter 5. Conclusion and evaluation 
 
Crowd simulation has been applied into many areas: film, game, military training, safety 
science, etc. Hence there are many works about pedestrian evacuation, city crowd simulation 
and other areas. Our work is a contribution to the film and game industry. We work specifically 
on spectator simulation in sports games. We design a framework of crowd spectator simulation. 
An agent?s five core features are: identifiable, situated, flexible, goal-directed and autonomous. 
These features can not be achieved without reasonable behaviour control. Specifically, a 
behaviour model structure is constructed to provide more flexibility on behaviour control.  
 
Environment setup, distribution of each character and motion library creation is the pre-
processing part of the whole work. Whilst our research is limited to the amount of processing I 
can do on my laptop, our system would scale to any number of spectators given enough 
processing power. Such a flexible basic structure can be easily embedded into other similar 
applications. Much code needs to be done here to support the basic structure of our work. 
Moreover, research on crowd and project model selection (including Flocking system, Particle 
system, Hybrid system and Agent-based system) has been done during the interim phase. These 
researches give us a clear view of the whole project.   
 
With many researches on social and scientific factors in crowd simulation before and after the 
interim report phase, we finally create our behaviour model. Three levels of behaviour are 
constructed under the scripted control and external control. And audiences? reactions to certain 
events have also been achieved in this model. The behaviour FSM has a well-structured 
framework which means more branch clips could be added efficiently and this structure is 
easily-maintained even by those who have no experience on programming like artists. This 
means also we don?t have a brilliant visual effect on the crowd in our project. But based on our 
framework, artists are able to make vivid and autonomous crowd more easily. And this 
structure is portable to be used in other crowd applications besides the crowd spectator 
simulation. Although in our work behaviour generator is based on FSM and action clips should 
be manually classified into different sets, this system can be reused in any crowd scenes. 
Moreover, clips in each state could be easily added, deleted or modified.  
 
FSM is utilized in our model to help sort out behaviour schedule during simulation. Its motion-
graph structure is a very powerful tool to be used in our program. We create a self-searching 
algorithm which allows the system to traverse the motion tree based on behavioural rules. And 
a multiple-clip state solution is designed for increasing the behaviour variety. Only a number of 
high-level states are needed to perform a complex crowd. Our behaviour search approach is 
scalable which means without increasing the FSM?s complexity synthesized motions can be 
added to perform more interesting and human-like behaviours. An agent reaction mechanism 
has been modelled and implemented. This reaction model allows the crowd to be controlled by 
only a few events or emotion parameters. It means that it is feasible for animators to manipulate 
crowd by only adjusting few control parameters from UI.    
 
Many technical details have been solved. We give a detailed description of the solution to these 
technique problems in our work: Motion scheduling mechanism and how it is represented in 
Crowd Spectator Simulation For Sports Games 
 
54 
 
Maya environment has been discussed clearly; some core nodes like motion library, clip 
scheduler and animcurve have been explained in detail in our project; methodology like relative 
and absolute properties and motion transition are implemented. Some other implementation like 
variety on skeletons also has been demonstrated. Our system requires a relatively small space 
for storing motion data which helps alleviate the resource-limited conditions. Our crowd 
spectator can perform clap, cheer and idle behaviours with only 200 frames of data in all.  
 
Although in our work rendering process is not our concern, we still give a comprehensive 
review of it. Because rendering is a parallel research area compared to ours in crowd simulation 
area. It is a very important visual representation issue. Thus three methods have been discussed 
which could be an extension of our work. LOD, a technical representation issue, has been 
solved and illustrated at the end of our project. 
 
In conclusion, our project provides a comprehensive structure of crowd spectator simulation. 
We have tested our crowd with simple motion data which are keyframed by us. They all work 
and transit very well. Behaviour model has been evaluated by the reaction and emotion sample 
discussed in chapter 3. In addition, based on our production tool, it is very convenient for 
animator to add more motion capture data to make the whole scene more vivid and real. The 
user interface we developed is very friendly and normally an animator does not have so much 
learning gap on it. Therefore, we believe that the aims and objects set in our report have been 
achieved.

Chapter 6. Future development 
 
6.1 Motion capture data 
 
Nowadays, motion capture data has been widely applied in film and game industry. Motion 
capture data can be indirectly imported into any related model template. In our project, we do 
not have the chance to get access to motion capture facilities. Thus, on an artistic level, crowd 
behaviour can not be simulated as same as that of a real human. Although the aim of our project 
is not to simulate the exact same behaviour from human-beings, it is true that our visual effect 
could get a better effect from motion capture data.  
 
6.2 Parameterized state 
 
In many pedestrian simulation work, an agent?s velocity and direction often changes at run time. 
So it is also feasible to make crowd spectators? motion clip be re-sampled and redirected. In our 
project, behaviour like ÒidleÓ, ÒclapÓ, ÒcheerÓ is still not accurate and completely parameterized. 
These states only obey the FSM rules and transit according to the pre-defined routine. For 
future development, it is possible to make all the states contain some parameters. This means 
based on the basic information of state, system could have a more flexible transition along the 
whole motion graph. For example, instead of defining ÒidleÓ state in the BFSM, it is better to 
have a definition of Òclap toward X directionÓ, Òclap oriented to LEFTÓ, etc. This method not 
only reduces the space for storing motion data, but also improves the flexibility of behaviour 
planner. Even more, a combination like Òclap toward X direction and oriented to LEFTÓ would 
provide larger variety of crowd behaviour.  
 
6.3 Crowd dynamics  
 
The crowd pattern and behaviour also might be simulated based on some pure mathematical 
model. An idea come from thermal dynamics is possible to be applied into crowd simulation. A 
crowd can be treated as a jar of water boiled on the fire. At first, when the temperature of water 
is very low, only a few bubbles rise to the surface. This phenomenon is just like at first when 
the expressiveness index of the game performance is not very high, there are only a few 
scattered people clapping. After some time (specified time in our project), when the water is 
boiling, many bubbles rise to the water surface and burst. This is just like the scene that all the 
audiences stand up and cheer for the excellent goal. This research area might be helpful to the 
dynamic research of agent-based crowd.

6.4 Path finding and collision avoidance 
 
Some researches on pedestrians have been done. It is possible for us to adapt their algorithm 
and structure into our future work. For example, in our crowd spectator simulation, it is very 
likely to have a more complex scene with other types of agents like the securities, referee, and 
athletes. Most of them need to be designed to have the intelligence to walk, run and manage 
more complicated actions. The involved work might be related to the path finding, collision 
avoidance and action point setting, etc.
