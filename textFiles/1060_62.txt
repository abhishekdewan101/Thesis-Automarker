1Abstract
A group is said to be pseudo-free if an adversary who is allowed to see group descrip-
tion, is unable to solve non-trivial equations. Non-trivial equations are the equations
that have no solution in a free group. The notion of pseudo-freeness was introduced by
Rivest, who left as a open problems whether such groups exists in cryptography or not.
Rivest’s conjecture that the RSA group is pseudo-free has been settled by Micciancio
for case of static adversary who is given only the group description and his goal is to
come up with an equation and solution.
Later on the notion of pseudo-freeness has been extended to adaptive adversary for
case of univariate equations by Dario.C, Dario.F and warinschi.B. In case of adaptive
pseudo-free groups, the adversary learns solutions of some non-trivial equations before
producing a new equation.
In this project we make extension to the notion of pseudo-free groups from univari-
ate to multivariate equations and system of equations in face of adaptive adversary.
In our setting along with the group description the adversary is allowed to see some
non-trivial equations with their solutions and finally his goal is to come up with new
non-trivial equation and solution.
First of all we show triviality for case of adaptive pseudo-free groups[page 30] and
then craft definitions with respect to multivariate equations[page 32] and system of
equations[page 42]. Therefore in this project we provide
• Formal definition of adaptive pseudo-free groups with multivariate equations and
system of equations
• Proof that the ”The RSA group is adaptive pseudo-free with respect to multivari-
ate equations”[page 32].

51 Introduction
Most of the modern cryptography relies on difficulty of solving non trivial equations
over computational finite groups. Cryptography speculates pseudo-free groups as a
very strong and interesting notion. The notion of pseudo-free groups was first intro-
duced by Hohenberger[18]. She presented an informal definition of such groups. She
used them to identify transitive signature schemes along with their variants and found
that the adversary cannot efficiently compute their inversion[18]. After Hohenberger,
Rivest[31] polished this notion and extended it by defining it formally. He considered
pseudo-free groups to be a strong notion and assumed that many other computational
assumptions[26] typically used in cryptography, like the hardness of computing discrete
logarithms, the RSA assumption and the strong RSA assumption holds the property of
pseudo-free groups. Subsequently D.Miccianico[26] proved the pseudo-freeness of the
RSA group under the strong RSA assumption for static adversary. He proved pseudo-
freeness of RSA group (Z?N) at least when N = PQ and is the product of two safe primes
such that P = 2p + 1 and Q = 2q + 1. Here P,Q are safe (odd) primes and p, q are
known as Sophie German primes. Safe prime is a special type of prime numbers used in
cryptography. In his static setting[26], the adversary is allowed to see the description
of the group and finally his goal is to come up with some equation and solution to that
equation.
Informally, a computational group is considered to be pseudo-free if an adversary who
is allowed to see description of the group cannot efficiently compute solutions for non-
trivial equations, where as non-trivial equation means the equation whose solution does
not exist in a free group. We give the formal description of pseudo-free groups in sec-
tion[3.4]. Free groups[26] are used in Dolev-Yao model for symbolic analysis of public
key cryptographic protocols. From past few years, a lot of study[26] have been carried
out to cover the gap between the symbolic Dolev- Yao model and standard computa-
tional model used in cryptography in order to achieve computational soundness results
for symbolic analysis methods. An important motivation to study pseudo-free groups
is to see whether it can be used to extend Dolev-Yao security model with cryptographic
functions that make use of such groups in cryptography and lead to many new appli-
cations. Other reasons for studying pseudo-free groups are as follows [31]:
- Proofs perhaps might be made easier with the use of stronger assumptions that in
turn incorporates many other common cryptographic assumptions like the hardness of
computing discrete logarithms and the strong RSA assumption
- If we assume that a group is pseudo-free then it may possibly allow an even wider
range of applications, as the strong RSA assumption has been very serviceable in the
construction of many cryptographic functions which are not acknowledged to be secure
under the standard version of the RSA assumption
6- There is no prevailing solution for specific cryptographic primitives, like directed
transitive signature schemes whose construction has been linked to Pseudo-freeness
In cryptography[9], Pseudo-free groups so far do not have so many applications and
the reason for this is that in most of the cases of RSA group, not only group’s de-
scription is provided to adversary but also he is given some equations and solutions.
Thus after learning solutions to some equations his goal is to output a new equation
along with its solution. For example as defined in [9] such cases holds true for signa-
ture schemes based on RSA where adversary can output signature to solve equation
whose solution does not exist in a free group. Here the adversary can gain access to
an oracle through chosen message attack and generates forgery as a solution to new
non trivial equation. This problem was noticed by Rivest[31] who left the notion of
pseudo-freeness as an open problem and also mentioned, whether pseudo-free groups
exist in cryptography?.
1.1 Aims and Objectives
The main aim of the project is to explore the notion of pseudo-free groups with mul-
tivariate equations and system of equations to adaptive adversary. Pseudo-free groups
so far has been defined for univariate and multivariate equations for static adversary
and univariate equations for adaptive adversary. In this project we extend this study
and identify pseudo-freeness with respect to an adversary who may learn solutions to
other non-trivial equations before solving a new non-trivial equation.
This project has follwing objectives:
• To define adaptive pseudo-freeness with respect to multivariate equations and
system of equations.
• To provide constructions that will show how RSA group satisfies our definitions.
The current definitions of pseudo-free groups are not sufficient to make use of such
groups in cryptography[26]. The reason is that an adversary[9] that interacts with
some cryptographic primitive built on top of a group may obtain additional informa-
tion not available to him in the game that defines pseudo-freeness. Therefore we explore
this notion with the intuition of getting much stronger version of pseudo-free groups..
Adaptive pseudo-freeness[9]: Informally in adaptive pseudo-free groups, the ad-
versary along with the group description is allowed to see some equations (that have
no solution in a free group) together with its solutions. Finally aim of adversary is to
come up with new non-trivial equation and solution.
In this project we explore the notion of adaptive pseudo-free groups and prove that
the RSA is adaptive pseudo-free. Our results in [5.5] holds for multivariate equations
but can easily extend to system of equations. The definition of pseudo-free groups in
7adaptive setting consists of two design decisions. The first issue with the design is to
set equations for which an adversary can see solutions and the second issue is to define
what do we actually mean by non-trivial multivariate equations in adaptive setting of
pseudo-free groups. We first define triviality[5.4,6.1] of equations and then craft a def-
inition of adaptive pseudo-free groups for case of multivariate equations[Definition 11]
and system of equations [Definition 13]. We detail our results next.
1.2 Structure
This report consist of six main sections. The first section is devoted to introduce the
basic concept of pseudo-free groups with the motivation of why there is a need to study
such groups. Section two presents some preliminaries and mathematical background
which is necessary to understand the notion of pseudo-freeness. Section three describes
the formal definition of free groups and pseudo-free groups with the implication of such
groups to other strong cryptographic assumptions. Section four presents the formal
definition of static pseudo-free groups and shows that how RSA group satisfies this
definition in case of static adversary. Section five presents adaptive pseudo-free groups
and their applications. In this section we introduce our concept of adaptive pseudo-free
groups with multivariate equations. First of all we show triviality in case of multivariate
equations and then craft definition out of them. Later in this section we prove that the
RSA is adaptive pseudo-free with multivariate equations. In Section six we extend the
notion of adaptive pseudo-free groups from multivariate to system of equations. Finally
in last two sections we discuss some open problems that have been investigated in the
notion of pseudo-freeness and as a future scope we show an idea of extracting a more
efficient application out of these groups.
82 Preliminaries
2.1 The RSA Group[31]- The security of the RSA encryption scheme depends on
RSA assumption which works with multiplicative group Z?N such that N is the product
of two large primes.
RSA assumption-
This assumption states that it is hard for an PPT adversary given an interger ’N’, e
such that e>1 and a random y selected from Z?N to find x that satisfies
xe = y(modN)
with non-negligible probability.
Where ’N’ is the product of two randomly chosen large primes.
Strong RSA assumption-
This assumption states that it is hard for an PPT adversary given an interger ’N’, and
a random y selected from Z?N to find x and an integer e>1 that satisfies
xe = y(modN)
with non-negligible probability.
2.2 Mathematical Background
Before we describe in detail the concept of pseudo-free Groups, we present some math-
ematic background which is closely related to notion of pseudo-free groups.
2.2.1 Definition 1 Group[31] - A mathematical group G is defined as a pair of
(S,o) where S is the set of elements and ’o’ is an operator on S that satisfies the fol-
lowing properties.
• Closure- This property states that if there exists two elements i,j that belongs
to set S and defined by some binary relation o then the resultant (i o j) ? S.
• Identity - This property states that if there exists an identity element e ? S
such that for all i in S, i o e = e o i = i .
• Associativity - It states that for some elements say a,b,c that belongs to set S
and defined by some binary operator o then
i o(j o k) = (i o j) o k.
• Inverses - It states that for some element i ? S,there exists some other element
j ? S such that the following condition holds:
(i o j) = (i o j).
9The notation xy is same as x o y and a?s inverse is denoted by a?1. The notation xn
means that the word (x, x, x, ..., x) is of length n and x?n is the word (x?1, x?1, ..., x?1)
of length n.
2.2.2 Computational Groups
Informally, a mathematical group G has some representation [G] and such represen-
tations [G] are known as computational groups[31]. In cryptography these groups are
widely used and many other groups are based on the notion of such groups. For in-
stance if we define set G as a group then we can consider G as a computational group
[G] with identity 1.
Formally such groups are defined as:
Definition 2[31]: A group is said to be computational group if it represents an under-
lying mathematical group G = (S, o) and provides efficient (polynomial time) algorithms
for each of the operations given below:
• Composition- It states that giving a representation of elements say [i], [j] that
belongs to computational group [G], compute representation of [i]o[j]
• Identity- Find representation of identity element e that belongs to [G]
• Inverses-Given some element [i] that belongs to [G],find [i?1].
• Equality Testing- It states that on giving representation of two elements [i][j]
that belongs to computational group[G],determine if i = j
• Sampling- (only if G is finite) returns representation [i] that is chosen uniformly
at random from [G] or in a manner that is similar from uniformly at random
to a probabilistic polynomial time adversary. Such a procedure is denoted as
[i] ?R [G].
2.2.3 Black Box Groups
Babai and Szemeredi introduced a notion- Black Box. This notion may be used by the
parties in cryptographic protocol to access the group. According to black box assump-
tion [31], each element of the computational group G is a bit string of some common
length N , and Black Box subroutines are available for the group operations.
Only with the help of given implementations group operations can be performed. This
is Black Box assumption, in which the representation of group elements is opaque: op-
erations on them other than through the black box routines are forbidden.
10
Naturally, one may be curious to enquire the possibility for having black box algo-
rithm for various group-theoretic problems. As the selections of the operations to be
performed during algorithm design is restricted, Black Box assumption results in self
imposed restrictions or conventions which are in turn favorable for algorithm design.
Various techniques are not required for finding an algorithm if we use black box as-
sumption as it itself gives satisfying result.
For example A probabilistic black box algorithm given by Tonelli nad shanks for finding
the square roots of Z?P . This algorithm is used to find representation of an element [x]
having value x on giving [a] and P such that:
x2 = a mod P
The black box assumption becomes restrictive if there does not exist any efficient al-
gorithm to compute this. For example shoup has proved lower bounds for discrete
algorithm and other problems in discrete model.
However our priority for studying is cryptographic security not algorithmic efficiency.
An adversary may check the code that implements group operations or test the bits of
any representation as it is likely for typical adversary to violate any black box assump-
tion willfully.
As an example like Z?N where the adversary is allowed to see N and a code for composi-
tion. Therefore the attacker can see the code or bit-level representation of elements by
using techniques like index method calculus which is not there in black box assumption.
Thus, we do not consider black box assumptions. We assume by default that ad-
versary can access any obtainable information and also may use techniques which are
dependent on implementation or representation details. Non-black-box admission of the
adversary to the group implementation is thus considered universally. A representation
of a Computational groups allows one to decide whether a group is pseudo-free or not.
Therefore one can think like that if an equation has a solution in computational group
, then only there exists a solution of the corresponding equation in a mathematical
group.
2.3 Division intractable functions
A function H is said to be division intractable[9] if it is not possible for an adversary
to compute ({p1, ..., pn}, q) such that q ?= pi for all (i = 1 to n) and H(q) divides H(pi).
The notion of division intractable functions was introduced by Gennaro et al. Any
function that maps input to prime numbers clearly satisfies the property of division
intractable functions.
11
Definition 3 [9] - Division intractable functions
Let H denotes family of hashes having poly(h)-bit input and h-bit output. A func-
tion H is said to be division intractable if it is not possible for an adversary to compute
1) H is randomly chosen from H
2) Adversary produces ({p1, ..., pn}, q) such that q ?= pi? (i = 1 to n) and H(q) divides
H(pi).
2.4 Shamir’s Trick
Assume xa = ybmodN for all a,b > 0.Let z = gcd(a,b), Then there exists an algorithm
that computes f such that fa = yzmodN.
Proof :- Using Extended euclidean algorithm we can find u,v ? Z such that au+bv = z.
? bv = z ? au.
Thus xav = ybv = yz?au
? yz = xavyau = (xvyu)a = (f)a
12
3 Free Groups
Free groups are infinite groups that are constructed from a given set of generators such
that there do not exist any non trivial relationship between them.
The formal definition of Free group[31] is as follows:
Definition 4: Let A = {a1, ...., am} represents a non-empty set of distinct symbols
such that {a1, ...., am} are known as generators of the free group. Let the inverse of
each symbol say ai is given by a
?1
i such that then A
?1 represents the non-empty set
{a?11 , ...., a?1m }. Let Aˆ denotes A
?
A?1 where as Aˆ is the set of symbols for the free
group .
Let the free group is denoted by F (A), it can also be written as F (a1, ...., am) if A=
{a1, ...., am}. Elements in free groups can be written as words.
For example the word below:
a?11 a1a
?1
2 a3a
?1
3 a3a4
is representing elements of F (a1, a2, a3, a4)
A word in a free group can be reduced by eliminating the adjacent inverse symbols.
Therefore the word in the given above example can be reduced and written as a?12 a4.
A word is said to be in reduced or canonical form if it cannot be reduced further. Thus
we can say that the words in canonical form are the elements of the free group.
The binary operation o in a free group is a concatenation followed by simplification.
For example
a1a2 o a
?1
3 a
?1
1 = a1a2a
?1
3 a
?1
1 = a2a
?1
3 .
An empty word is the identity of a free group. Two words in a free group represent the
same element if their canonical forms after simplification are exactly same. The reverse
of the word is known as the inverse of the word.
3.1 Free Abelian Groups
A group is said to be free abelian group [31,19]if it is defined in a same manner as a free
group. These groups are denoted as FA{a1, ...., am} such that {a1, ...., am} are known
as generators.
The reduced form of a word in free abelian group FA{a1, ...., am} to a word of the
form :
as11 a
s2
2 a
s3
3 ....a
sn
m
13
is defined by commutativity whereas s1, s2, s3, ..., sn are integers.
A free abelian group FA{a1, ...., am} is isomorphic to the m-fold direct sum Z
?
Z
?
...
?
Z.
Thus we can represent an element as11 a
s2
2 a
s3
3 ....a
sn
m of FA{a1, ...., am} with vector (s1, s2, s3...., sn)
and implement o with the vector addition.
3.2 Equations in Free Groups
The equations in free groups[31] are as follows:
Let ’F’ be a free group having a set of generators a1, a2, a3, ..., am. Let x1, x2, x3, ..., xn
be variables in F. Thus an equation in free group F can be written as:
w1 = w2
where w1 and w2 represents the words formed from variables of F i.e. x1, x2, x3, ..., xn
and set of generators a1, a2, a3, ..., an. We can also write these equations in reduced
(canonical) form for some w.
For example an equation in F (a1, a2)
a?11 x1 = x2a2
In free groups the equations that have solutions are known as satisfiable equations
and the equations that do not have any solution are known as unsatisfiable equations.
Makanin in 1982[24] showed that it is possible to find whether an equation is satisfiable
or unsatisfiable in a free group. More recently Gutierrez in 2000[16] showed that the
above problem is possible in PSPACE.
When the free group is abelian group FA(a1, a2, a3, ..., an), then one can find whether
the equation has solution or not. The equation is always rewritten as:
xe11 x
e2
2 ...x
en
n = a
s1
1 a
s2
2 ...a
sm
m
for integers e1, e2, , en and s1, s2, ..., sm. These equations are satisfiable only if ?i, 1 ≤
j ≤ m we have
gcd(e1, e2, ..., en)|sj
An equation which has solution in F (A) has also solution in FA(A) but the converse
is not always true. This is beneficial because it gives an easy way to show that an
equation has no solution in a F (A) and merely prove that it has no solution in FA(A).
14
3.3 The correspondence
Pseudo-free groups considered to be a strong notion from cryptographic perspective
and many other cryptographic assumptions holds on to the notion of pseudo-freeness.
In each and every case one can find its formulation interesting.
For example[31], for the below quadratic equation
x2 = a
there does not exist any solution in a free group because the canonical form of x always
has even length where x is variable and a is the generator.
Thus the above equation has no solution in a free group, what does it mean for the
same equation in group G?
In computational groups there may exist solutions of non-trivial equations. For example
there exist a solution of the above mentioned equation in Z?N such that.
x2 = a
has a trivial solution if one is given a = 4 then we can find a clear solution as x = 2.
The above problem can be solved if each of the generators say ai must correspond
independently to a randomly generated element of G. As in [31], an adversary can
distinguish a group G from a free group if
(1) An adversary outputs an equation E with variables x1, ..., xn and constants a1, ..., am
that has no solution in a fre e group.
(2)An adversary come up with randomly chosen values a1, ..., am and use them as con-
stants for the equation.
(3)An adversary suceessfully produce variables x1, ..., xn that satisfiies the equation.
As per definition of pseudo-free groups, the adverary can selects equation by his own
as long as the equation has no solution in a free group. This generalize the situation
for the strong RSA assumption where the adversary can select the exponent.
15
3.4 Pseudo-free Gropus
More specifically , a computational group is said to be pseudo-free group if it is not pos-
sible for an adversary who is given only the group description to produce an equation
E and solution S to that equation. For example in pseudo-free groups, if an adversary
is given randomly a then it is not possible for him to efficiently compute solution of an
equation xe = a where e ?=1, or for x31x42 = a5, but can solve an equation x21x2 = a5
because this equation is trivial and has solution over the free group if we put x1 = a2
and x2 = a.
Definition 5[31,26].:- A family of computational groups G = GN for N≥ 0 is said to
pseudo-free if all operations in GN is performed in polynomial time in k. and for every
probabilistic polynomial time adversary A following holds. Let N ? Nk be a randomly
chosen group index and define ? : A ? GN by choosing ?(a) at random in GN for each
a? A. Then the probability on giving (N,?) as input, the adversary outputs an equation
’E’ and solution ’S’ is almost negligible in k.
This definition belongs to the family of computational groups but we can apply this
definition to mathematical groups by understanding that the implementation of such
groups in some standard way as computational groups.
3.4.1 Types of pseudo-free groups
There are two types od pseudo-free groups which are as follows
(1) Static pseudo-free groups
(2) Adaptive pseudo-free groups
Static pseudo-free groups :-
A group is said to be static pseudo-free if an adversary who is allowed to see description
of the group can not solve new nontrivial equation and solution.
Adaptive pseudo-free groups :-
In adaptive pseudo-free groups, along with group description an adversary is allowed
to see some non-trivial equations and solutions and finally his goal is to come up with
new non-trivial equation and solution.
3.5 Cryptographic assumptions holds on pseudo-free groups
There are six cryptographic assumptions[31] considered by Lipschutz and Miller that
are as follows:
• The order problem
• The power problem
• The root problem
16
• The proper power problem
• The generalized power problem
• The intersection problem
Lipschutz and Miller has shown that the above mentioned six fundamental problems are
independent i.e. for each pair of problems there exists a group such that one problem
has solution in a group where as other problem has no solution.
Rivest[31] has shown that the above six fundamental problems are intractable in
pseudo-free groups such that no probabilistic polynomial time adversary can solve these
problems with non-negligible probability. On the other side, Rivest also left a very in-
teresting question whether or not the computational Diffie-Hellman problem (CDH)
holds true by pseudo-free groups.
Order problem
The order problem states the following: Given an input x ? G to find an integer n
which satisfies
xe = 1
where e is a positive integer and 1 is the identity of group. Thus it means that solving
xe = 1 for positive integer n. The order of the element x is the least positive value of
x in G.
Theorem 1 ([31]): In a pseudo-free group G, it is hard for an adversary to state
the order of an element p that is chosen randomly.
Power problem
The power problem states the following:
Given elements x and y such that x, y ? G to find an integer n > 1
xn = y
such that the value of n is the discrete logarithm of y to the base x in G. The power
problem is often considered to be hard for some groups G. For example Diffie and
Hellmann determined that the power problem was hard in Z?e where e is a large prime.
Theorem 2([31]) In a pseudo-free groups, it is hard for an adversary given some
random values x and y to compute the discrete logarithm problem.
Root problem(RSA assumption)
The RSA problem states the following:
Given input y ? G and an integer e greater than 1 to find x that satisfies
17
xe = y
Theorem 3:([31])In a pseudo-free groups, the RSA assumption holds.
Proper power problem(strong RSA assumption)
The RSA problem states the following:
Given input y ? G to find an integer e greater than 1 and x that satisfies
xe = y
Theorem 4:([31]) In pseudo-free groups, the strong RSA assumption holds.
In this case the adversary by himself selects an exponent e > 1. The adversary cannot
solve the above equation even if he comes up with an integer e >1 on his own.
Generalized Power problem
The generalized problem is defined as:
Given inputs p, q ? G to get integers x, y that satisfies
px = qy
Theorem 5:([31])In pseudo-free groups, it is hard for an adversary to compute the
generalized power problem.
Intersection Power problem
The intersection problem is defined as:
Given inputs p, q ? G to get integers x, y that satisfies
px = qy ?= 1
Theorem 6:([31])In pseudo-free groups, it is not possible for an adversary to compute
the intersection problem for cyclic subgroups.
3.6 Diffie Hellman assumption
Fascinatingly, the(computational) Diffie-Hellman problem is unsuitable for our formal-
ism. Diffie-Hellman assumption[31] is implied by pseudo-freeness is a very appealing
open problem. More specifically it is left as an open problem by Rivest whether Diffie
Hellman assumption holds the property of pseudo-freeness or not.
The computational Diffie-Hellman problem(CDH)[31] considers the following
Given some value g and two other values x and y such that
18
x = gi
y = gj
for integers i and j that are chosen randomly to find
a = gij
With the provided x and y, an adversary will have slight chance for computing a,
this is CDH assumption. The most obvious way to prove that the CDH assumption
is implied by pseudo-freeness is via above equations, wherei and j are integer-valued
variables, and a is a group valued variable. However, this argument does not succeed
as an adversary who violates CDH to deduce a need not be able to find i and j (this
is DLP). It appears that any equation in variable a alone, for checking the correctness
of computed a is unavailable. In other words the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem is
not satisfiable by checking a set of equations that involves a single element x.

4 Static pseudo-free groups
The notion of pseudo-free groups to static adversary has been extended by D.Micciancio[26].
Informally static pseudo-free groups are the computational groups where the adversary
is given only randomly chosen generators of the equation and his goal is to come up
with both equation and solution. More specially, in these groups the adversary is static
i.e. allowed to see only description of the group without any other information. If
the order of the group is known then it is very easy to compute solution for nontrivial
equation Thus in static pseudo-free group, order of the group is hidden from adversary.
The definition given by Micciancio was similar to that one defined by Rivest in [31].
Micciancio proved that RSA groups holds much stronger version of pseudo-freeness. He
has shown that it is infeasible for an adversary to compute unsolvable equations along
with their solutions in a given computational group. His proof that RSA is pseudo-free
in [26] is based on following properties with the assumption that starting from arbitrary
equations yields simpler and simpler equations.
• In a free group unsolvable equations are mapped to unsolvable equations.
• Over the computational group, one can map solution of original equations to
solution of resulting equations
4.1 Formal Definition
Definition 6 [26]- A family of computational groups G = GN for N≥ 0 is said to be
static pseudo-free if all operations in GN is performed in polynomial time in k. and
for every probabilistic polynomial time adversary A following holds. Let N ? Nk be a
randomly chosen group index and define ? : A ? GN by choosing ?(a) at random in
GN for each a? A. Then the probability on giving (N,?) as input, the adversary outputs
an equation ’E’ and solution ’S’ is almost negligible in k.
The definition of pseudo-free groups given by Rivest was for the single equation which
has no solution in a free group but has solution in computational group. Micciancio
made extension to the definition of pseudo-free groups that they consist of single equa-
tion to a system of equations by transforming system of equations to a single equation
which is equivalent to the system. Any system of equation in this transformation can
map to single equation whose solution set is a superset of the solutions to the system.
Definition 7 [26]- A family of computational groups G = GN for N ≥ 0 is said
to be static pseudo-free if the the probability on giving (N,?)= (Ei{i?I},?) as input to
an adversary, the adversary outputs an system of equations Ei{i?I} with their solutions
? : X ? GN is almost negligible in k.

4.2 The RSA is static pseudo-free
Lemma 1[26]:- For a family of computational groups G there exists an PPT algorithm
that on input an equation ? (which is a pair of {X,A} such that ’X’ is set of variables
an ’A’ is set of constants), a group G and an assignment ?:X ?G, outputs a single
variable equation ??and solution ?? ? G that satisfies the following properties:
(1) If an equation ? does not have a solution in a free group, then ?? also has no
solution in a free group.
(2) For any assignment a:A ? G, if ? is a solution to ?a, then ?? is a solution to
??
Proof :- Let
? = {xe11 xe22 ....xenn = as11 as22 ....asmm }
be an input equation and ?:X ?G be an variable assignment.
Thus by using extended euclidean algorithm one can finde = gcd(ex : x ? X) and
integers e?x(x ? X) such that ?
x exe
?
x = e
Therefore the algorithm on input the above equation outputs an single variable equation
which is of the form:
?? = {xe = as11 as22 ....asmm }
along with its solution ?? =
?
x?X ?(x)
ex/e. Thus we have to prove that the output
equation satisfy the above properties
In order to prove first property,for sake of contradiction we assume that there exists a
solution of the the output equation ?? in a free group. Let ?? be a such solution. then
we have
??e = as11 a
s2
2 ....a
sm
m
Thus for any x ? X we have ?(x)ex/e = (??)
? ?(x)1/e?x = (??)
? ?(x) = (??)e?x
We can clearly see that ? is a solution of equation ? because?
x?X ?(x)
ex = ??
?
x exe
?
x
21
? ??e = as11 as22 ....asmm
This proves the first property which means that the output equation ?? also has a solu-
tion in a free group.
To prove second property, first of all set an assignment a : A ? G and let ? : X ? G
be asolution to ?a which means that?
x?X ?(x)
ex = as11 a
s2
2 ...a
sm
m
Therefore
??e = (
?
x?X ?(x)
ex/e)e =
?
x?X ?(x)
ex = as11 a
s2
2 ....a
sm
m
Thus we can see that ? is a solution to ? a over G.

5 Adaptive pseudo-free groups
In adaptive pseudo-free groups[9] an adversary is permitted to look at some nontrivial
equations and solutions along with the group description and finally his goal is to come
up with new non-trivial equation and solution. As discussed above that in case of static
pseudo-free groups the adversary is given only the randomly chosen generators used in
equation and he has to come up with new nontrivial equation and solution. Therefore
in our adaptive setting the adversary knows additional information which may help
him in solving other equations which do not have a solution in a free group. In case
of adaptive pseudo-free groups the game between challenger and adversary works as
follows[9]:
Set up:- In this case the challanger randomly selects an instance of compuational
group,sets an assignment and then gives assignments and group description to adver-
sary.
Equation queries :- In this phase the adversary can see some equations and solu-
tions
Challenge :- In this stage the adversary is given a chllenge that he has to produce
a new non-trivial equation with its solution.
The definition of pseudo-free groups in adaptive setting[9] consists of two design deci-
sions. The first issue with the design is to set equations for which an adversary can
see solutions and the second issue is to define what do we actually mean by non-trivial
multivariate equations in adaptive setting of pseudo-free groups.
As discussed above the first issue is to fix the type of equations but the important
thing which is to be considered here is how the equations can be produced for which
adversary can see solution because if we give too much freedom to adversary then it
can violate the security. Even keeping more restrictions here won’t allow us to define
adaptive setting for an adversary. Therefore first issue with the design has been resolved
by considering some parametric distribution over the set of equations.
5.1 Equation setup in adaptive pseudo-free groups
In second stage of adaptive pseudo-free groups,the adversary is allowed to see some non-
trivial equations and solutions. Therefore the equations are controlled by parametric
distribution[9]. More specifically, equations are selected according to some parametric
distribution where the distribution depends on the parameter of an adversary. The
parameter supplied by adversary may lead to different variety of adversaries ranging
from weak one to a strong one.
In case of weak adversary, we consider weak definition of adaptive pseudo-free groups
23
where the adversary has no control over the equations. This means that the challenger
chooses an equation , sets an assignment, computes the solution of an equation and fi-
nally gives equation and its solution to an adversary. Hence in this case the adversary is
not that much adaptive, so he can get all equations together with their solutions at once.
In strongest form of adversary, the case is not the same as we saw in weakest form. In
this case the adversary is really adaptive and can select equations by his own choice.
The adversary can choose equations in an adaptive manner such that the adversary
first choose an equation, get back its solutions, then choose another equation, get back
solution and so on. This definition of pseudo-freeness is known as strong adaptive
pseudo-freeness.
In static pseudo-free groups where the adversary is given only randomly chosen gen-
erators of the equation and his goal is to come up with solution to that equation. In
contrast, the notion of pseudo-freeness in adaptive setting[9] has been extended to more
general level. In case of adaptive adversary,we have done a new kind of setting where
the adversary has limited control over the set of equations. This limitation is controlled
by parametric distribution ?. The adversary supplied a parameter M of some length
which is required for sampling from distribution. The distribution then provides m+1
integers which is written as (e, s) where as e and s are integers. Once the parameter
M is fixed, then ?(M) is the distribution from which e and s are drawn.
5.2 Non-trivial Multivariate Equations
Rivest in [31] defined non trivial equations in a way that they do not have any solution
in a free group. We define non-trivial equations in some other way because in our case
the adversary is allowed to see some additional information also which may be useful for
him to solve other non-trivial equations. Therefore we define non-triviality by analysing
equations over quotients of free groups.
we describe a framework that defines the non-triviality for multivariate equations.
Let [9] FA(a1...am) denotes a free abelian group such that {a1...am} are the gener-
ators of the group and there exists some binary relation ? ? FA? FA on free abelian
group that makes equalities in words. As mentioned earlier, we would now hence aim
to characterize the set of all equalities that can be derived from ? . Recollect the fact
that ultimately these equalities are construed over computational groups, thus there
are two ways for an adversary to formulate new equalities ?. The first way is by using
group operations and their properties over computational groups.
For example let ? = a1a2 = a21a4 then one can also find a1a
2
2 = a
2
1a4a2 = a
3
1a
2
4.Thus we
have computed first equality just by multiplying a2 to both sides in the equation and
second we have derived from the property of computational group. For instance if one
can derive the equality in the form wb1 = w2b in computational group, then can also
find equality of the form w1 = w2 provided ?b? should be prime. Moreover,we have to
24
take into account the above possibility for any q as we search for an abstraction which
is not dependent on the order of the group.
Definition 8[9]- Let FA{a1.....am} be a free abelian group defined by some binary
relation ? ? FA? FA on FA{a1....am}. Let ?? be the smallest congruence on FA.
- ? ???
?p ? N, ?w1, w2 ? FA,wb1 ?? wb2 ? w1 ?? W2.
then w1andw2 are trivially equal w.r.t ?isw1 ?? w2.
Therefore description for ?? is as follows.
Let ? = {(w1, 1, w2, 1), (w1, 2, w2, 2), ...., (w1, t, w2, t)}. Consider a binary relation R?
on free abelian group defined by:(w1, w2) ? R? if ?l1, l2...lt ? Q such that
w1 = w2.
?t

Thus we can say that exponentiation of the word w = as11 .....a

l = a/b is defined if and only if b divides gcd1≤i≤na.si.
5.3 Applications of adaptive pseudo-free groups
Adaptive pseudo-free groups[9] has an application to signatures and network coding
signatures. These applications has been defined for univariate equations.
5.3.1 Signatures from Adaptive pseudo-free Groups
Construction of signature scheme
A signature scheme for family of adaptive pseudo-free groups with univariate equa-
tions[9] works as follows:
Let ?? denotes a parametric distribution that belongs to a specific class of parametric
distribution ?n and G be a family of adaptive pseudo-free groups with respect to ??.
Thus the signature scheme works as :
(1) Key Generation (1k, N)
Let A = {a1, a2....am} and X = {x} be a set of constants and variables. In this
phase first of all the key generation algorithm randomly choose an instance of compu-
tational group GN from a family of computational groups G then sets an assignment
? : A? GN .
Finally it sets verificaion key(public key) vk = {X,A,?, GN ,??} and signing key(secret
key) as sk = order{GN}.
25
(2) Signing (sk,M)
In this phase, ?? gives (e, s, r) as output and the signing algorithm use secret key
which is equal to order of GN to compute solution of the univariate equation which is
in the form of
xe = as11 .....a
sm
m
If ? be a solution of the equation then the signing algorithm finally gives signature as
? = (e, s, r,?) for M .
(3) verification(vk,M,?)
In this phase the verification algorithm performs the verification of signature on mes-
sage M by checking two conditions.
1)It verifies whether ver??(e, s, r,M) = 1.
2)It checks if ? is a solution of the equation xe = as11 .....a
sm
m .
If both the conditions are satisfied than it gives 1 as output ,otherwise 0.
5.3.2 Linear Network Coding
Network coding is technique of transmitting information in which the nodes of the net-
work combines several packets they receive and then transmits them in order to achieve
maximum information flow in the network. The transmitted information[9] is expressed
in a vector form as (v1, ..., vm). Before transmitting any information, a sequence of m-
augmented vectors(p1, ..., pm) are generated by the source code by prepending ui to vi.
Each ui has 1 in i-th position and 0 in other positions. The source in the network
sends the augmented vectors as packets in the network. The nodes in the network after
receiving p1, p2, ...., pm process these packets by performing linear combination and then
sends them as a resultant vector to its outgoing edges.
A node must receive m valid vectors pi of the form p1, p2, ..., pm to get original in-
formation and for which uis are linearly dependent. Thus the original message M is
retrieved as
M = U?1V
Where U and V are the matrix with rows u1, u2, ...., um and v1, v2, ...., vm.
The malicious nodes in the network makes the retrieval of the original information
impossible by injecting invalid vectors. The above mentioned idea is susceptible to
these kind of attacks. A solution to overcome this problem is to use network coding
signatures that checks whether a given vector is valid or not just by checking condition
whether it has been generated by linear combination of valid vectors.
26
5.3.3 Network Coding Signatures
Definition 9[9] : A network coding signature is defined by a triple of algorithms
(NetKG, Sign, Ver) such that :
(1) NetKG(1k,N)
In this phase the algorithm takes input as k and N and produces output vk and sk.
Where k is the security parameter
N is the parameter that defines the size of signed vectors
vk is the public verification key
sk is the secret signing key.
(2) sign(sk,V)
The signing algorithm in this phase produces signature ? for message M on input
sk, fid and m dimensional subspace V ? FN .
Where fid is a random file identifier.
(3) ver(vk,V,?)
The verification algorithm on input (vk, fid, V ? FN, ) gives output as 1 (accept)
or 0 (reject). This algorithm checks one condition that if ? is valid signature produced
by signing algorithm for all honestly generated key pairs (vk, sk), all fid (random file
identifier) and for all V ? FN . If the condition is satisfied then the algorithm gives
output as 1 for all v ? V otherwise 0.
5.3.4 Homomorphic Network Coding Signatures
Definition 10[9]:- : Homomorphic network coding signatures are special type of net-
work coding signatures that are defined by a 4-tuple of algorithms ( NetKG, Sign, Ver,
Combine)such that:
(1) NetKG(1k, N)
In this phase the algorithm takes input as k and N and produces output vk and sk.
Where k is the security parameter
N is the parameter that defines the size of signed vectors
vk is the public verification key
sk is the secret signing key.
27
(2) Sign (sk, V, fid)
The signing algorithm in this phase produces signature ? for message M on input
sk, fid and m dimensional subspace V ? FN .
Where fid is a random file identifier.
(3) Combine (vk, fid,(wi, ?i)li=1)
On input vk,fid (random file identifier), set of tuples (wi, ?i), this algorithm produce
a new signature ? as output such that if each ?i is a valid signature on vi then ? is a
valid signature for v which is obtained from linear combination
?l
(i=1)wivi.
(4) Ver (vk, V, fid) -
The verification algorithm on input (vk, fid, V ? FN, ?), gives output as 1 means
accept or 0 means reject. This algorithm checks one condition that if sigma is valid
signature produced by signing algorithm for all honestly generated key pairs (vk, sk),
all fid?s (random file identifier) and for all V ? FN . If the condition is satisfied the
algorithm gives ouput as 1 for all v ? V otherwise 0.
5.3.5 Network Coding Signatures from Adaptive pseudo-free groups
As we have discussed above in[9] network coding signature scheme, a file to be transmit-
ted is expressed as an ordered sequence of set of vectors (v1, v2, .vm) of n components.
These vectors will be prepended with a vector ui of m components. Let wi be the set
of resulting vectors.
Let R = {0, ..., r ? 1} denotes the set of coefficients from where they are randomly sam-
pled. Let U denotes an upper bound on the path length from source to destination.Thus
from the above positions B = mrU . This denotes the largest value of u-coordinates in
vectors. Moreover denoting an upper bound with M on the magnitude of the coordi-
nates of the initial vectors {v1, v2, ...., vm}, we set B? =MB.
Let ?n denotes the parametric distribution that takes input as (fid, V, B?).Let ls de-
notes a security parameter and l represents an integer such that 2l > B, compute
H(fid) where H is an division intractable function. For each vi = (vi1, v
i
2, ..., v
i
n) ? V .
First of all it uniformly samples al+ ls bit random integers si and then gives output as
(si, ui, vi). Thus ?n gives output as (e, {si, u(i), v(i)}mi=1
Let ?? denotes a parametric distribution belongs to a specific class of parametric distri-
bution ?n and G be a family of adaptive pseudo-free groups with respect to ??. Thus
the signature scheme works as :
28
(1) NetKG(1k,N)
Let A = p1, ..., pn, q1, ..., q2 and X = x be a set of constants and variables. In this
phase first of all the key generation algorithm randomly choose an instance of compu-
tational group GN from a family of computational groups G,then sets an assignment
? : A? GN .
Finally it sets verificaion key(public key) vk = {X,A,?, GN ,??} and signing key(secret
key) as sk = order{GN}.
(2) sign(sk,V)
In this phase, first of all the signing algorithm choose a random indentifier fid for
V and then runs ?n to obtain (e, {si, u(i), v(i)}mi=1 Finally it uses secret key which is
equal to order of GN to compute solution of the univariate equation which is in the
form of
xe = psip
vi1
1 ...p
vin
n q
ui1
1 ...q
uim
2
If ? be an solution of the equation then the signing algorithm finally gives signature as
? = (e, {si, u(i), v(i)}mi=1,?) for M .
(3) ver(vk,V,?):
In this phase the verification algorithm performs the verification of signature on mes-
sage M by checking two conditions.
1)It verifies whether ver?n(e, {si, u(i), v(i)}mi=1,?) = 1.
2)It checks if ? is a solution of the equation xe = psip
vi1
1 ...p
vin
n q
ui1
1 ...q
uim
2 .
If both the conditions are satisfied than it gives 1 as ouput ,otherwise 0.
(4) combine(vk,fid,?1, ..., ?l):
This algorithm works as follows:
First of all it removes wi that have u co-ordinates negative or larger than B/(mq) or
have v coordinates negative or larger than B?/(mq). Thus the remaining vectors are
w1, w2, .., wn.
Finally this algorithm randomly choose a1, a2, ..., an ? Q then set w =
?n
i=1 aiwi and
produce signature as output ? = (e, s, w, fid,?) on w by computing

Adaptive Pseudo-free Groups
Informally, adaptive-pseudo-free groups[9] are the computational groups in which the
adversary is permittef to look at several equations along with their solutions and his
goal is to solve a new non-trivial equation where non-trivial equations means the equa-
tions that do not have solutions in a free group.
The formal definition of adaptive pseudo-free groups[9] given below is for a set ’A’ of
? generators, a computational group {GN}N and a distribution ? over set of equations .

In this phase first of all the challenger randomly selects instance of computational group
{GN} that belongs to a family of G where G = {GN}N?Nk and then sets an assignment
n: A? {GN} for set A of generators and parametric distribution ?. At last the input
to the assignment n: A? {GN},description of the computational Group {GN} and
parametric distribution ? is given to the Adversary A.
Equation queries
In this phase the adversary is permitted to look at the equations along with their
solutions. The queried equations are controlled by the adversary through paramet-
ric distribution ?. Thus the adversary A selects Mk for each query and gives it to
challenger. Then the challenger runs (eki , s
k
j ) ? ?ˆ(Mk), computes the solution ?i for
equation ?i and gives back (?i,(eki , s
k
j )) to adversary A.
Challenge
After the adversary is acquaimted with equations and their solutions then he tries to
produce an equation ?? with a solution ??.The adversary succeeds in the game if he
successfully produces a non trivial equation.
Definition 11 [9] Adaptive pseudo-free Groups:- A family of computational Group
G is said to be adaptive Pesudo-free with respect to some distribution ?, if for any set
’A’ of polynomial size, any probabilistic time adversary A succeeds in the game above
with at most negligible probability.
5.5 The RSA group is Adaptive Pseudo-free
Theorem 7 :- If the strong RSA assumption holds, then Z?N is adaptive pseudo-free
with respect to ?ˆ
Proof :- For the sake of contraction, we assume that RSA is not adaptive Pseudo-free
33
with respect to multivariate equations. As per our definition of Adaptive pseudo-free
groups with respect to multivariate equations there exists a probabilistic polynomial
time adversary A with non-negligible probability that is supposed to produce an equa-
tion ?? together with a solution ?? in such a way that ?? is non-trivial with respect to
previous queried equations.
For proof we construct an adversary B from an adversary A such that B?s main goal is
to break strong RSA assumption. More specifically, adversary B is constructed in such
a manner that if adversary A can break the adaptive pseuco-freeness of RSA group
with respect to multivariate equations, then B can break strong RSA assumption
Let ?ˆ(Mk)? (eki , skj , rki ) for all k ? (1...t), i ? (1...n), j ? (1...m).
where ’k’ is the number of queries done by adversary A.
In order to prove the theorem we show two types of adverseries if we consider e?i from
the equation( the adversary is supposed to produce) and eki (already queried equations)
for all k ? (1...t), i ? (1...n).
TYPE 1-
Adversary produce e?i such that e
?
i doesnot divide
?n
i=1
?t
k=1 e
k
i .
TYPE 2-
Adversary produce e?i such that e
?
i divides
?n
i=1
?t
k=1 e
k
i .
Type 1 -
In this case we construct Adversary B that can break strong RSA assumption. As per
Strong RSA assumption, it is not possible for an adversary given y and N to find x
and e such that
xe = ymodN
where ?N ? is the product of two safe primes p and q and ’y’ has been taken from QRN .
Thus Adversary B has input y and N and his aim is to compute e-th root x of y for
some e of his own choice.
The following scenario consist of three stages as follows.
(1) Setup -
In this phase Adversary B randomly selects {r11, ......., rtn} and computes {e11, ......., etn}
as follows
eki = H(r
k
i ) for all (i = 1,......n) and (k = 1,......,t).
Then B randomly selects {z1, z2, z3, ......., zm} from {1, ....., N2} in order to set assign-
34
ment ? for constant symbols.
Let E =
?n
i=1
?t
k=1 e
k
i .
Thus B sets assignments as follows.
?(a1) = yEz1
?(a2) = ?(a1)z2
Thus ?(aj) = ?(a1)zj . for all (j = 2,.....,.m).
B also randomly selects {z1, z2, z3, ......., zn} from {1, ....., N2} and sets the constant
variable symbols as follows :
x2 = yEz2
Thus xi = (x2)Zi for i = 3 to n.
Finally Adversary B send assignments ? and description of the computational group
to adversary A.
Let Zi = bip?q? + ci. is selected randmoly from {1, 2, ...., N2} and distribution of each
and every (zimodp’q’) is indistinguishable from uniform distribution over {Zp?q?}.
(2) Equation Queries -
In this phase adversaryA adaptively query equations by supplying parameters {M1, ....,M t}
for ?ˆ. Thus adversary B is allowed to compute solutions of equations ( for k = 1 to
t) for adversary A and finally provides equations and their solutions to A. In order to
solve each equation B selects exponents according to parametric distribution ?ˆ(Mk) (
for all k = 1 to t) from {sk2, sk3, ......., skm}.
Therefore B solve equations as
?i ? {xe
k
1
1 x
ek2
2 .....x
ekn
n = a1a
sk2
2 .....a
skm
m }tk=1
Let Ei =
?n
i=1
?t
j=1 e
j
i where j ?= k.
The above equations can be also written as
x
ek1
1 =
a1a
sk2
2 ....a
skm
m
x
ek2
2 ....x
ekn
n
Thus by substituting the values of {a1, a2, ...., am}and{x2, x3, ....., xn} we have
?k(x1) =
(yEi)Z1+
?m
j=2 s
k
jZj
(yEi)Z2e
k
2+
?n
i=3 e
k
i Zj
= (yEi)Z1+
?m
j=2 s
k
jZj?
?n
i=2 e
k
i Zj
35
Finally B gives (eki , skj , rki ,?(xi)) to A.
(3) Challange -
Once the adversary A has seen equations along with their solutions in the previous
phase, then in this stage he tries to produce an equation ?? along with its solution ??
such that ?? is non-trivial to previously queried equations.
Hence (e?i , s
?
j , r
?
i ) is distributed with respect to ?ˆ(M
?)
Thus ?? ? {xe?11 xe
?

e?n
n = a1a

??(x1) =
(yE)Z1+

(yE)Z2e
?

?n
j=3 e
?
iZj
= (yE)Z1+
?m
j=2 s
?
jZj?
?n
j=2 e
?
iZj
Let Eˆ = E(Z1 +
?m
j=2 s
?
jZj ?
?n
j=2 e
?
jZj) and u = GCD(e
?
i , Eˆ). Provided e
?
i does not
divide Eˆ. Therefore adversary B can use shamir’s trick to get (e?i /u)-th root of x of y
for e of his own choice and thus give (e?i /u,x ) to break strong RSA assumption.
Finally we need to show that (e?i ) does not divide Eˆ with non-negligible probabil-
ity. If we consider some prime r that divides (e?i ). As we are in Type 1 adversary
such that r does not divide E. Therefore we have to show that r does not divide
Z1 +
?m
j=2 s
?
jZj ?
?n
j=2 e
?
jZj. As we know that Zi = bip
?q? + ci.Since bi is not known
to adversary and r depends on ci. Thus r does not divide p’q’ and the probability
with which Z1 +
?m
j=2 s
?
jZj ?
?n
j=2 e
?
jZj = 0 mod r is 1/r. Thus we can say that the
probability with which (e?i ) does not divide Eˆ is (1-1/r) for small prime factor r of (e
?
i ).
Type 2 -
In this case adversary outputs e?i such that e
?
i divides
?n
i=1
?t
k=1 e
k
i . Thus we have
two sub-cases as follows:
1) In this case for all k = 1 to t and i = 1 to n ,(r?i ?= rki ). Therefore our assumption
on ?ˆ is not satisfied as we would be able to break division intractability of the function
H. As we have (r11, .....r
t
n) and (r
?
i ?= rki ) for all k = 1 to t and i = 1 to n such that
H(r?i ) = e
?
i |
?n
i=1
?t
k=1 e
k
i where H(r
k
i ) = (e
k
i ) .
2) In this case for some j = 1 to t and i = 1 to n ,(r?i = r
j
i ) where j ?= k. There-
fore we have (e?i = e
j
i ). Now we give simulation for the given case below. First of all
we describe how to construct an adversary B whose main goal is to break strong RSA
assumption.
36
Before proceeding towards simulation we provide some details that will be usefull for
reader to understand this approach.
Let (eki , s
k
j ) be the exponents of ?k for all k = 1 to t and (e
?
i , s
?
j) be the exponents
of ?? . since the equation ?? is non-trivial, thus
?k ? Zt, V ? Zmsuchthat : e?(
?
Erk + Vr) ?= s?
.
We show the above condition in matrix form as:
e?i (
?????
1    1
s12    st2
...
...
s1m    stm
?????
???k11,1/e11    kn1,1/et1... ...

v11    vn1
v12    vn2
...
...
v1m    vnm
?????) ?=
?????
1
s?2
...
s?m
?????
Thus the above comdition is true for all k ? Zt, V ? Zm, then it must be true for
some kˆ and Vˆ . As we are in the case where (e?i = e
j
i ). It is easy to see that the first
equation is always true for kˆ and Vˆ . Then it will also be true for (sjv ?= s?v) for some v
= 2 to m. Adversary B can randomly select j from ( 1 to t) and v from (2 to m) and
then perform the simulation as follows:
(1) Setup -
In this phase Adversary B randomly selects {r11, ......., rtn} and computes {e11, ......., etn}
as follows
eki = H(r
k
i ) for all (i = 1 to n) and (k = 1 to t).
Then B randomly selects (g1, g2, ...., gm) from QRN and Zv, ? from {1, 2...., N2} and set
assignments as:
Let E =
?n
i=1
?t
k=1 e
k
i .
Thus B sets assignments as follows.
?(a2) = yE
Thus ?(av) = ?(a2)zv . for all (v = 2,......,m).
?(a1) = ?(a2)??gE1
Thus ?(ai) = (gi)El from i = (3,...,m) and i ?= v.
where El =
?n
i=1
?t
l=1 e
l
i
37
B also randomly selects {z1, z2, z3, ......., zn} from {1, ....., N2} and set the constant vari-
able symbols as follows :
x2 = yEz2
Thus xi = (x2)Zi for x = 3 to n.
Finally Adversary B sends assignments ? and description of the computational Group
to adversary A.
(2) Equation Queries -
In this phase adversaryA adaptively query equations by supplying parameters {M1, ....,M t}
for ?ˆ. Thus adversary B is allowed to compute solutions of equations (fork = 1tot)
for adversary A and finally provides equations and their solutions to A. In order to
solve each equation B selects exponents according to parametric distribution ?ˆ(Mk)
(forallk = 1tot) from {sk2, sk3, ......., skm}.
Therefore B solve equations as
?i ? {xe
k
1
1 x
ek2
2 .......x
ekn
n = a1a
sk2
2 .......a
skm
m }tk=1
The above equations can be also written as
x
ek1
1 =
a1a
sk2
2 .......a
skm
m
x
ek2
2 ........x
ekn
n
Thus by substituting the values of {a1, a2, ...., am}and{x2, x3, ....., xn} we have
?k(x1) =
(yEl)1+Zvs
k
v??(
?m
j=1,j ?=2,v u

?k(x1) = (y
El)1+Zvs
k
v??(
?m
j=1,j ?=2,v u

j )
El??ni=2 eki Zj
Thus for solving j -th equation adversary B adopt a different technique as follows:
Let M j be the queried parameter.In order to solve each equation B selects exponents
according to parametric distribution ?ˆ(M j) (forallj = 1tot) from {sj2, sj3, ......., sjm}.
Then B fix sj2 = ?? Zvsjvmodeji and compute ? in such a way that ? ? Zvsjv = sj2 +
?eji .Then B then find
?j(x1) =
(y??)(
?m
i=1,i ?=2,v u
sji
i )
El

?n

(a1a

Finally B gives (eki , skj , rki ,?(xi)) to A after solving each equation.
(3) Challange -
Once the adversary A has seen equations together with their solutions in the previ-
ous phase, then in this stage he tries to produce an equation ?? along with its solution
?? such that ?? is non-trivial to previously queried equations.
Therefore B will find root of y as follows:
We can write
(
??(x1)
?j(x1)
)e

i =

(s?i?sji )
i )
(El)e
j
i (
n?
i=2

?(e?i+eji )
i )
where (l ?= j ).
Hence we have a case where e?i = e
j
i , therefore by substituting the value of xi for all ( i
= 2 to n) we get
[(
??(x1)
?j(x1)
)(
m?
i=1,i ?=v

(s?i?sji )
i ))
(El)]
e?i = (yEl)(s
?
2?sj2)+zv(s?v?sjv)?(
?n
i=2?(e?i+eji )Zj)
Let Eˆ = El((s?2 ? sj2) + zv(s?v ? sjv)? (
?n
i=2?(e?i + eji )Zj)).Finally we need to show
that (e?i ) does not divide Eˆ with non-negligible probability. As we know that Zi = bip
?q? + ci.Since
bi is not known to adversary. we can see that (e?i ) | El and also s?v ? sjv ?= 0, we have
that
(e?i ) | (s?2 ? sj2) + zv(s?v ? sjv)? (
?n
i=2?(e?i + eji )Zj) with negligible probability. There-
fore adversary B can use shamir’s trick to get (e?i /u)-th root of x of y to break strong
RSA assumption where u = GCD(e?i , Eˆ).
The theorm RSA is adaptive pseudo-free with respect to multivariate equations can
be proved by means of corollary using two new parametric distributions (?ˆS, ˆ?CH ?= ?ˆ)
such that ?ˆS is a variant of ?ˆ
39
Corollary 1 [9] :- If the strong RSA assumption holds, then Z?N is adaptive pseudo-free
with multivariate equations with respect to ?ˆS.
The proof for the given corollary follows from that of theorem 1. The main idea here is
that one can guess si in advance with non-negligible probability when they are small.
As we have defined above that ?ˆS is a variant of ?ˆ such that s2 is equal to 0 and
si?(i = 3tom) ? Ze is the output of chameleon hash function CH(M,R) defined over
parameter M and randomness R.
Corollary 2[9] :- If the strong RSA assumption holds and CH is a chameleon hash
function, then Z?N is adaptive pseudo-free with multivariate equations with respect to
ˆ?CH .
The corollary has same proof as defined in corollary 1. The main idea here is that
one can use the property of chameleon hash functions during simulation in order to
choose si in advance.
Weak Adaptive Pseudo-freeness of the RSA Group:-
In weakest form of adaptive pseudo-free groups, the adversary at the start is allowed
to select parameters M1, ...,M t before giving any group description.If one can think of
such a notion of adaptive pseudo-freeness then we can prove theorem 1 in more general
way with respect to much general distribution than ?ˆ where (e, s2, ..., sm) needs to be
bound to M . Thus we can see one can compute all r?is in advance at the start because
the simulator knows M1, ....,M t.

6 Pseudo-free Groups with System of Equations
6.1 Non-Trivial System of Equations
In this section we extend the notion of adaptive pseudo-free groups from multivariate to
system of equations. The intuition behind this is to allow adversary to come up with a
new set of equations. In definition [11] the adversary is allowed to see some non-trivial
equations along with solutions and finally he has to come up with a new non-trivial
equation and solution. Therefore in this case the game is same as the adversary is
given a set of non-trivial multivariate equations but here he also has to come up with
a new set of equations that are non-trivial to the given set. Formally we define as below:
Let

6.2 Adaptive Pseudo-free Groups With System of Equations
The formal definition of adaptive pseudo-free groups[9] given below is for a set ’A’ of
? generators, a computational group {GN}N and a distribution ? over set of equations .
Setup
In this phase first of all the challenger randomly selects instance of computational
group {GN} that belongs to a family of G where G = {GN}N?Nk and then sets an
assignment n: A? {GN} for set A of generators and parametric distribution ?. At
last the input to the assignment n: A? {GN},description of the computational Group
{GN} and parametric distribution ? is given to the Adversary A.
Equation queries
In this phase the adversary is permitted to look at equations together with their solu-
tions. The queried equations are controlled by the adversary through parametric distri-
bution ?. Thus the adversary A chooses Mk for each query and gives it to challenger.
Then the challenger runs (eki , s
k
j ) ? ?ˆ(Mk), computes the solution ?i of equation ?i
and gives back (?i,(eki , s
k
j )) to adversary A.
Challenge
After the adversary is acquaimted with equations and their solutions, then he tries
to produce set of equations ?j with a solution ?j for( j= 1..t).The adversary succeeds
in the game if he successfully produces a non trivial equation.
42
Definition 13 [9] Adaptive Pseudo-free Groups with System of Equations:- A
family of computational Group G is said to be adaptive Pseudo-free with respect to some
distribution ?, if for any set ’A’ of polynomial size, any probabilistic time adversary A
succeeds in the game above with at most negligible probability.

7 Conclusion
In this project we have seen that the concept of pseudo-freeness seems to be a strong,
natural and quite plausible in commonly used groups in cryptography. We have ex-
plored the notion of adaptive pseudo-free groups from univariate to multivariate and
system of equations. We have studied and identified pseudo-free group with respect to
adaptive adversaries who aim to solve non trivial equations along with their solutions.
First of all we have shown triviality for the case of adaptive pseudo-free groups and then
introduced formal definition of such groups for multivariate and system of equations.
There are many open problems left by Rivest[31]. As one of the open problem is
to find groups in cryptography that satisfies the notion of pseudo-free groups. Thus
for a case we have proved the adaptive pseudo-freeness of the RSA group (Z?N) with
multivarite equations under reasonable conditions such that N is the product of two
safe primes. Another problem in [31]is to prove the pseudo-freeness of Diffe-Hellman
assumption as we have seen that the Diffe-Hellman assumption(either computational
or decisional) does not satisfies the property of pseudo-free groups. In this project we
have not addressed this problem but in future it would be interesting to see whether
Diffe-Hellman assumption holds our definition of adaptive pseudo-free groups.
Another open research in this direction is to to find crytographic applications[26] that
provides the usefullness of such groups in cryptography. In next section we have just
provide an idea of extracting an application out of adaptive pseudo-free groups with
respect to multivarite equations. It would be interesting to see whether that application
really holds our definition and can capture use of pseudo-free groups in cryptography.
44
8 Future Work
The study of pseudo-free groups carried out so far did not allow us to extract appli-
cations out of them because of prime generation. As an first application of adaptive
pseudo-free groups (a signature scheme) for univariate equations defined in [9], is more
efficient than the current RSA based signature schemes but it requires a longer public
key. It may be a case that we can resolve this issue by constructing a signature scheme
out of adaptive pseudo-free groups with multivariate equations. One way to construct
a more efficient signature scheme is to consider equations that do not have prime ex-
ponents as prime generation is the bottleneck.
The cryptographic assumptions such as discrete logarithm problem and the Diffie-
Hellman problem[26] are considered at least as hard as factoring and currently there
is no relation between pseudo-free groups and these assumptions. An interesting work
is to see that whether such cryptographic assumptions in pseudo-free groups are com-
putationally hard. Finally it would be interesting to find relationship between pseudo-
freeness and other cryptographic assumptions with the intuition of using such groups
in cryptography.
