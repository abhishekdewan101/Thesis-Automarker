1. SUMMARY 
The project topic “Collaborative Touchless Interaction” is an interesting and vast topic 
which consists of various aspect/fields, in particular the Human Computer Interaction 
subject area, of Computer Science. With the rapid development in computer technology 
and related fields computer systems are used in most aspects of human day-to-day 
activities. This has led to the change in our perspective towards computer systems and 
human interaction with these systems.  
This report gives an insight of the background study related to Human computer 
Interaction, Touchless Interaction, Exertion Interface & games, Collaborative Play in 
Urban Screen Games which are so far independently implemented. This project covers 
the various important aspect of human life such as exertion activity, social interaction 
and play, games in public environment.  
The main objective of this project is to design and develop an Exertion game based on 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction which is played in a public space (ideally an open 
arena) on a large public display system. In this project about 60% of the major work is 
research; hence it involves a lot of reviewing of the existing framework and design, 
giving a critical analysis on whether it fits our system requirement. The remaining 35% 
in implementation of the game and other 5% would be any theoretical suggestions 
made during the research and implementation stage. 
The conclusion drawn from this research was used to implement a Human pong game 
which would try to bring in an exertion activity such as running, jumping with 
collaborative touchless interaction by the player with urban public screen, all on a 
single platform of a game played in public. The aim of this project is to develop an 
exertion game for a public setting with touchless interaction based on Mueller’s 
framework and to check if this framework can be used to develop more such exertion 
game that come under the category of social game or suggest changes to existing 
framework or build a new one. The game was successfully designed & implemented 
based on Mueller’s framework. An experiment was conducted to test the game in a real 
environment and feedback from the participants was taken in form of questionnaire 
and interview. 
Based on the design & implementation, results of the experiment based on participants’ 
feedback it can be concluded that the present state of Mueller framework befits the 
game/system we are intending to research, i.e. a computer game, with high level 
exertion required to play the game, for large screens in urban setting having touchless 
interaction with those screens.

2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Objectives 
 
The main objective of this project is to design and develop an Exertion game based on 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction which is played in a public space (ideally an open 
arena) on a public display system. Going forward with the design and implementation, 
we would identify the issues when trying to conglomerate three uniquely different 
fields such as Exertion Games, Touchless Interaction and public/large display system of 
Computer Science on a single platform (game) and attempt to provide a solution to 
those issues.  
2.2 Motivation 
 
Video games, that provide interactive user interface and gives visual feedback, are most 
popular among people and children alike and children find the games fun and 
entertaining. These days, people are more inclined towards video games and spend 
most of their time in playing these sedentary games than a traditional outdoor sport. 
This gives a negative impact on the health and lifestyle of humans, making them 
lethargic, obese and also isolating them from the outside world in terms of socialising 
and physical activity, making them sedentary in their world of video games.  
In order to overcome or minimize the adverse effects of video games and yet provide 
the entertainment, more pervasive and intuitive game console has to be developed. 
Hence, an attempt was made to design and develop a touch less interaction game which 
can act as a source of physical workout along with the necessary entertainment. Playing 
touchless interaction games requires significantly more energy than their real 
counterparts that they simulate. Hence these games are better than the sedentary video 
games in terms of energy expenditure and physical activity. Apart from the physical 
activity, touchless and controller free interactive gaming is more enjoyable and requires 
more effort than playing games by clicking buttons. Greater involvement and 
participation of players is required while playing controller free games, which gets the 
family members off the couch and strengthen the bond in the family or socially bind 
people when played in a public space, through the interactive, energetic and fun filled 
type of playing games. 
With the touchless interactive game in mind, developing the game fulfilling all the 
requirements by taking care of all the nuances of the game and niches of players is quite 
challenging. Efforts were put in developing the game to provide an interactive and 
interesting game, different from other video games and apparently healthier game 
helping people to come out of their stagnant life.

2.3 Aims  
 
In my thesis I study Muller’s framework for exertion game by implementing game in a 
public setting, and analysis if game with physical activity provide a sense of exertion 
and helps kick start a great conversation between strangers using the large screens in 
the urban setting.  The main aim of such design is giving participants an experience of 
exertion presenting a situation for social exercising/gaming and investigating if that 
facilitates unknown people in a public setting to interact with each other. By exertion 
activity I mean, the one that requires intense physical effort like running, hogging or 
playing a sport. 
This whole setting of exertion activity in a public setting and interaction in a touchless 
manner with large screens raises a lot of questions and also provide great opportunities 
for developing system with social exercising as a genre. These questions ought to be 
considered only as a part of the various questions that could be the part of the study. 
? What level of social interactions does an exertion game facilitate in a public 
setting?  
? Do exertion games support the feel of drawing people together? Does it provide a 
sense of experiencing a feeling of exercising together? 
? Does an exertion game alleviate starting a conversation between strangers?  
? Do exertion games help getting to know a person better by conveying further 
information about a person, which traditional button-press games cannot?  
? Does exertion game provide an essence of competition or collaborative playing, 
or both to an extent, in a public setting?  
? What are the advantages of touchless interaction in comparison to traditional 
touch based interactions?  
? How can the large screens in public space used for social gaming? 
? How can we incorporate touchless interaction with large screens in public space?  
? How does the interaction with an Exertion game in a public setting be different 
from those in non-public setting?  
? How could we implement exertion games in a touchless manner?  
? Is Touchless exertion game enjoyable to play?  
2.4 Scope  
This thesis reviews the experience of participants playing an exertion game in public 
setting. The participants were grouped into team of two. Due to the limitation in space 
and hardware, it was not very feasible to conduct the experiment on large teams. 
However recommendations were provided to develop games that support large teams 
and rating & feedback can be changed based on it.

2.5 Thesis Statement  
I postulate that an exertion game played in public setting involving touchless interaction 
will not only help people to easily acquaint with each other but also provide a great 
experience of social gaming with a sense of exertion making it more fun compared to a 
traditional passively-interactive button-press computer games. 
2.6 Thesis Overview 
Chapter 1 provides a single page summary of the entire thesis. Chapter 2 provides a 
concise understanding of the social exertion gaming and ability for assisting interaction 
among unknown people in a public place. In this chapter the aim of the project and the 
thesis statement is articulated. In chapter 3 previous works in various related fields like 
HCI, touchless interaction, and content of large screens are reviewed and previous 
research made by Mueller in exertion game is discussed. I designed a game that uses an 
exertion activity like running which can be played in public space, which is described in 
chapter 4, beside the technical details of the implementations. 
Chapter 5 illustrates the experiment combined with the experience of the participants. 
The increase in the interaction levels before and after gaming between the participants 
were examined. The results and observations obtained through interviews and 
questionnaire are pointed out in chapter 6. Chapter 7 concludes the discussion with 
suggestion for further improvements in the game. 
2.7 Summary  
This chapter suggests the importance of physical activities in today’s world. Such 
activities when combined with technologies bring about a social bonding that 
encourages interaction among unknown people. It defines the motivation behind 
developing an exertion game for public setting and its related benefits in the current 
day scenario.  It throws light upon the aim of the project which is based on Muller’s 
framework and the scope of the project.

3.0 LITERATURE REVIEW & BACKGROUND STUDY 
3.1 Introduction  
 
An in-depth literature review was made on various topics such as Human-Computer 
Interaction (HCI), Touchless Interaction, Exertion games, Public space games, Public 
space large displays and on various approaches to design such systems. A crystallize 
understanding of all the above topics were acquired by reviewing a large number of 
publications. The significant aspects of touchless interaction in HCI are discussed in 
different publications thus assisting to figuring out the advantages and disadvantages 
technology. An exhaustive analysis was made on the systematic exertion games design 
for social play. An extensive research was made on the factor that affect the design of 
content and games for large public displays. Since the project is a research-oriented, 
during the initial background research stage I did not have exact cognisant as to what 
we are looking for the above subject areas of Computer Science and since most of these 
field are still in early research stage the information is in this literature review very 
generic.  
Key research areas that were focused during this background study are. 
 
? To explore existing design patterns of each area and analyse if this satisfies the 
projected system, if not think of solutions to suggest changes or develop a new 
design framework that befits the projected system. 
 
?  Research on the design and implementation factors in such collaborative 
environment and get a holistic critique view on such generic system. 
 
? Difficulties in implementation of such games. 
 
3.2 Human Computer Interaction (HCI) 
 
The techniques used by humans to interact with a computer system or device is 
subjected to a lot of changes since the first era of computer system and this change will 
continue as the invention of new technologies. A generic definition Human-computer 
interaction is defined as “a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and 
implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of 
major phenomena surrounding them” [1]. From a computer science viewpoint this not 
only intends to provide great  calibre of interaction but also make interaction 
pleasurable with implementing intelligently adaptive active interfaces with 
multimodality design rather than passive interfaces with unimodal command or 
event/action based [2].HCI plays a vital role in the success for many reasons but the 
most basic of them is the fact that even the most advanced and efficient systems are 
ineffective unless they can be used in a simple and interactive manner by the user.

3.2.1 Subject areas of HCI 
 
 
 
Figure 1 
(Taken from Ref. [3]) 
  
Figure[1] gives the important fields associated with HCI such as , roots are from 
computer graphics, operating systems, ergonomics and human factors, engineering, 
cognitive psychology, and system aspect of computer science[3][4]. Among these 
various fields that are related with HCI, computer sciences and systems design plays a 
vital role as it calls for the designing, implementation and evaluation of interactive 
computer system/device based on the context in which the system will be used. 
Cognitive Psychology is the ability of the user in terms of perception, learning and 
reasoning. Ergonomics is all about a person’s physical ability. Sociology is used to get a 
wider knowledge about context of the interaction. 
3.2.2 Features of HCI 
 
(N) The nature of HCI 
This provides viewpoints that give the nature of HCI and the environment it will 
be used. This perspective is about viewing HCI as communication between the 
system and the user. 
The below diagram provides the five interconnected distinct features of HCI which are 
to be considered during HCI design [1].

Figure 2 
        (Taken from Ref. [1]) 
(U) Use and context of Computers system/application  
 
Computer systems are present in almost every aspect of people’s life with 
greater use in social, organizational and work aspect of the user (U1). In this 
environment users access the various which are applications that are the part of 
the system (U2).In this feature the system designer must think of the human, 
technical, and use of the application and make sure all these aspects fit with each 
other (U3). 
 
(H) Human (user) characteristics 
  
During the design HCI, the human side aspects of information processing (H1) 
[4], human communication and interaction methods (H2), and physical features 
of system users (H3) have to be taken into account. 
 
(C) Computer system and interface architecture 
 
On the system side we need to focus on input and output device, technologies 
necessary for the system implementation and various technical architectures 
such as networking, multitasking that help in the implementation of the system 
to satisfy the requirements. 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  11 
 
(D) The System Development process.  
 
The system development process involves integrating human-computer 
interaction methods in the design of the system using the information from the 
about features (D1), then implement the design using the required technology 
and tools (D2), develop techniques for evaluating the implemented system (D3). 
3.2.3 HCI Paradigms  
 
HCI paradigms would include the following components [5]: 
 
? Basic knowledge of the important features of interaction. 
 
? Set of various types of answerable questions that related to about those features 
of interaction, the paradigm has knowledge about. 
 
? Set of wide range of methods and procedures which can be implemented to give 
justifying solutions to the questions. 
 
? Basic knowledge of how to interpret the outcomes of these methods. 
 
3.2.3.1 The Three paradigms of HCI  
 
? The First Paradigm 
 
It is a combination of two diverse aspects, technology and human factors, resulting in 
interaction in a form of human-technology pairing. The focus of this paradigm, at that 
point was to provide consistent and simple interaction between humans and computer 
system. It mainly focused on identifying problems in the paring and providing practical 
solutions to those problems. In this paradigm the interaction is considered as a human-
technology pairing [5]. 
 
? The Second paradigm 
 
In this paradigm the focus completely shifted to the totally different view; it is about 
primal combination of human mind and computer as symmetric information processors 
[5].It focuses from both views, what’s occurring in the computer system at the same 
time in the human mind. In this paradigm the information communication between the 
human and the computer is conceived as interaction. Primary focus is about precise and 
effective communication. 
 
? The Third paradigm 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  12 
 
 
The view considers the holistic perspectives of the system within which the core is 
“interaction as phenomenological situated” logic. The primary aim is to endorse for 
interaction of “situated action in the world” [5]. This includes dealing with the 
dubiousness that arises in the complex situations of the environment for which the 
system is designed. In this paradigm the main aspect is to basically understand the 
interaction with respect to the context of the system and to make it a part of the system 
information flow.   
3.2.4 User Activity 
 
During designing an application involving HCI, various characteristic of human 
behaviours and communication methods have to be considered. At most times, 
complexity involved with the human in interaction process with the technology is 
overshadowed by the easiness of the interaction method. Depending on the 
application’s functionality, usability and the targeted audience, varies the complexity 
level of the application interfaces. 
 
User activity can be broadly classified into three different levels: physical [6], cognitive 
[7], and affective [8].  
 
1. Physical – this ascertain the dynamics/ bodily movements of user during 
interaction with computer system. 
 
2. Cognitive – this view provides the ways by which the users can understand and 
interact with computer system.  
 
3. Affective – this perspective is the latest and trending one, which concentrates on 
the providing a pleasurable interaction experience and also to impress the user 
by providing active interface for active interaction that enhances the user’s 
engagement with the technology .This can be achieved by interactive system 
response to the user. 
 
 
In this review we would focus more on physical and affective aspect of interaction .By 
combing the various methods of interaction and improving the performance of the 
method used, we can provide excellent and pleasurable interaction experience to the 
user.

COMSM3100  13 
 
3.2.5 HCI Systems Architecture  
 
System configuration plays a vital role in many aspects system of design including HCI. 
The basics of the systems configuration that involves the HCI are the inputs and outputs 
methods. HCI system architecture provides snapshot of various these inputs and 
outputs method and how their collaborative work enhances the user interaction 
experience. 
 
The HCI system can be broadly classified into 
 
? Unimodal Systems     
? Multimodal Systems 
 
Uni-modal System 
 
The different methods allow users to interact with computer system. This unique 
interaction methodology is called a modality [8]. 
Unimodal systems are developed based on only one modality. On the bases of the nature 
of these different modalities, they are categorised into three groups [8]:  
1. Visual Based Modality 
This is the most widely used modality. It  observes the visual response of the 
humans by tracking their facial expression, change in physical position of the 
body, gesture recognition eyes tracking and various other aspect of visual 
movements uses them as a input and output dynamics. Body movement tracking 
[2] and gesture recognition [11] [3] is mainly focused in this area and have been 
used to develop application with HCI event based scenario. 
2. Audio Based Modality  
The audio/sound plays a vital role in the overall interaction experience when 
using a computer and also has important role in HCI systems. This modality 
involves acquiring signals from various audio sources and processing them to 
obtain information. Many technologies like speech and speaker Recognition, 
emotion analysis using audio and music for interaction have been developed. 
Speech and speaker recognition are the two primary technologies that have been 
widely used and researched. 
3. Sensor Based Modality 
In this modality there exists atleast one physical sensor aiding the interaction 
between the user and computer system. These sensors can range from very 
simple to highly advanced ones. Various technologies build using this modal are 
from a traditional simple mouse, keyboard, pen based, joysticks and other 
gaming consoles to highly advance like pressure, temperature, smell sensor. 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  14 
 
Multi-modal systems 
As the name refers multi-modal, system developed using this modal implements various 
combination of the visual, audio and sensor modal. In the system with these modalities, 
refer to the ways in which the system captures the inputs and outputs the results. 
Consequently in a multimodal system there would be more than one interface that 
enables the human computer interaction through two or more styles of input and 
output unlike the traditional computer system that uses mouse and keyboard for input 
and a monitor for output. The accurate number of input and output modals, the 
technologies and the methodologies used for implementation varies from among 
multimodal system and is based on the requirements of the system .Most important 
aspect of developing system using multimodal architecture is to make sure that there is 
a perfect collaboration between different modalities used in the design [8].  
3.3 Touchless Interaction 
 
Touchless Interaction is about controlling/interacting with a Computer system or any 
device eliminating the encumbrance of physical contact with an interactive system. This 
results in a gratifying interaction experience. For example interacting with a device 
using a wireless controller is not considered as touchless Interaction. 
3.3.1 Touchless Interaction Models  
 
Touchless interaction can be multimodal interaction process which can include 
interaction based on  
? The visual modality – change of position, form or colour, 
? The auditory modality – based on speech recognition &sounds change or/and  
? The olfactory modality - odours [13]. 
 
In the following project, we will be focusing/using visual modality [13], i.e. change in 
users form and position with respect to hand/body, as germane input to the touchless 
interaction system. 
3.3.2 Classification of Gestures  
 
 “A gesture is a motion of the body that contains information” [14].Cadoz and Mulder 
[14][15] classified hand movements based on their functionality or intend of use into 
semiotic, ergotic, and epistemic. 
 
1. Semiotic as hand movements used to convey meaningful information or message. 
 
2. Ergotic as those hand movements used to alter object present in the physical 
environment. 
 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  15 
 
3. Epistemic as those hand movements used to gain knowledge of the surrounding 
with the sensation of touch (tactile haptic exploration property)[14]. 
 
We mainly focus on empty handed semiotic gestures that can be used for interaction 
with a device. 
3.3.3 Interaction Styles 
 
There are two major interaction styles that have to be considered when opting for 
touchless Interaction. They are Direct Manipulation and Indirect Manipulation [13]. 
3.3.3.1 Direct Manipulation 
 
Direct manipulation corresponds to what is known as control in an engineering process, 
where changing a variable determine the control and the change in control is given back 
so that the variable to be re adjusted to get the desired change. Direct manipulation 
corresponds to a direct mapping between the semantic & syntactic level. The change is 
syntax should result in a semantic change the system level and these changes in the 
internal level should be made visible on the screen. From the Human gesture aspect the 
direct manipulation are made using ergotic or epistemic gestures. The interaction 
always tends to change some apprehensible state but not to convey a message. 
3.3.3.2 Indirect Manipulation 
 
Indirect Manipulation is diametrically different to its counterpart Direct manipulation, 
It is termed as “communication based interaction”.[13].Hence indirect manipulation or 
communication based interaction are associated with the gesture based interactions but 
direct manipulation interaction is based on non-gestures. 
3.3.4 General Reasons for Touchless Interaction 
 
1. Aseptic environments conditions: Touchless Interactions help preserving aseptic 
conditions of the surrounding, especially when used for interaction with 
computers (medical devices) in operation room and other sterilised 
environments. With use of Touchless interaction technology instead of touch-
based helps in efficient utilization of resources [13]. 
 
2. Security of system: In the case of surveillance cameras or similar devices for 
sensing movements or other security can be placed in a secure place and 
interaction with such device can happen in a touchless manner [13]. 
 
3. Shared usage: Collectively used Interactive computer system can be easily 
accessed with touchless interaction by everyone and also help interacting with 
large displays like those in classroom or lecture theatre. 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  16 
 
4. Touchless Interaction can be used for interaction with large screen placed at 
distance from the user by processing their hand gestures eliminating the 
constraints in physical touch based interactions, hence facilitating natural 
interaction with tangible information systems [16]. 
 
5. Touchless interaction can be used in application that requires three dimension 
perspectives. It is easy to interact with interfaces and object in such an 
environment using touchless interaction.[13] 
 
6. Touchless interaction is the preferred interactive system even though it not easy 
to design a perfectly working and faster system compared to the traditional 
touch-based interaction because it provides a pleasurable and enjoyable 
interaction experience for the users. 
3.4 Interaction in Public space & Social Interaction  
 
Social interaction plays a vital role for eudaimonia of individuals. Nevertheless in a book 
“called Bowling Alone”, the author describes that individuals (author refers American 
society) growingly in number, lack social interaction [31]. With the enormous growth in 
the telecommunication technology industry over the last decade, it has made easier to 
communicate with family, friends and colleagues. Also with the advent of Social 
networking sites social interaction has reached a new higher level but these 
technologies do not urge people to socially interact with each other without a reason, 
particularly if they haven’t met before. We focus at encouraging casual social interaction 
between the people in a public space through games. 
 
Since the last decade there has been an increasingly growing number of digital displays 
within an urban public environment of various sizes and shapes used for commercial 
and cultural purposes such as advertisements, news, drama, sports, music, 
documentaries, interactive games, even support during various events .To design digital 
contents to these screens it requires a clear of understanding for the nature and extent 
of public involvement with these screens, and design contents that requires interactive 
participation from users rather than providing contents with just peripheral passive 
engagement. HCI researches have started analysing the collaborative interaction of a 
crowd with technology and not just individual interaction with technology. 
 
In this research we would concentrate more on the finding made till date on social and 
interactional behavioural perspective in urban public screen game which would provide 
some information regarding people’s behaviours and interactions with the interactive 
game played on these public screens. Following the finding from various researches 
paper indicates the important aspects to be considered while designing interactive 
applications like games for public screens [17][18][19]. 
 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  17 
 
? Physical space, health and Safety of people in public space  
 
Any content displayed on these public screens could have specific change in the 
behaviour of the   crowd in the vicinity. For example, if a popular sporting event like a 
football match is telecasted, it may result in a large crowd gathering or with an 
interactive application which involves physical activity, is likely to intervene with other 
people in the surrounding or disrupt the movement of the crowd. It is important for 
context designer and the screen management to understand these factor and design 
contents or interaction applications that has minimum risk with respect to public safety, 
and also making sure that precautionary appropriate health and safety measures are in 
place during such events. 
 
? Initiate participation among people  
We could face difficult challenges while starting game especially in the absence of a 
compere as initially getting a lone volunteer to start playing the game is difficult. Since 
most people in this setting are unknown to each other and since physical activities are 
large and visible, evaluation apprehension would play a major role as it can even make a 
participant to withdraw from playing. People would like observing other perform from 
distance before they decide to try the game hence visibility of interaction is important. 
 
Accidental interactions and a compere assist initiate participation to a great extent. 
Accidental interaction is when a person with no intent to play the game, walks through 
the interaction space which could result in initiating the game leads to unexpected 
participation. Simple demonstration game dynamics to the crowd could lead to 
participation. 
 
A compere assists in drawing people to participate by explaining the game and helping 
them overcome uncertainties. Compere also plays an important role during the entire 
course of the game by interacting with the audience and players appreciating their 
action. 
 
? coordinating collaborative play in public 
Since these games are designed for public spaces where most of the potential 
participants and audience are unknown it is important to understand and design game 
so the participants break the ice communicating better so that coordinate their play and 
the make audience also involve in game. To introduce coordination among unknown 
participants, social meaning and social rules have be understood. Design games that 
have multiple levels ranging from easy to play –to- difficult to master and have game 
dynamics such that there can be flexible coordination. The game design should induce 
collaboration among strangers and should be designed for playability and 
spectatorship. 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  18 
 
? Concept of using games as social resource  
 
People in a public setting will not come with a main intention of watching the Big 
Screens and participating in the interactive game, rather they come to these public 
setting for relaxation or taking a break from their various routine activities and socialise 
with family and friends. Viewing the Big Screens and playing an interactive game can be 
used as an interactive resource to socialise. 
In the public setting it is also necessary to keep the spectators engaged as they are also 
part of the setting and play in important fact on the player’s performance. Example if the 
spectator encourages the participants, it enhances the performance.   
Networking technology can be used to connect the large screens in various geographical 
locations (like different cities) so that the game can be played in a distributed manner. 
This also facilitates a sense of competition among the participant which result in greater 
interaction and give a good experience playing the game. 
3.5 Exertion games 
 
Games and sporting events/extravaganza have been useful in alleviating social 
interaction for player as well as spectators for long time now. Sports are one of those 
activities which are played and enjoyed by billions of people around the world, without 
any barriers of age, race or social status. Sports have dual advantage, of maintaining 
one's fitness through physical exercise, and increase the social interaction which is 
valuable for maintaining a healthy social relationship among family and friends. Sports 
also help building new rapport among people who has met before. These days, 
corporate sector uses games as a channel for team-building activity to develop rapport 
among fellow workers of new teams. 
Exertion activities are those which require intense physical effort and is defined by 
Mueller as “exertion is the act of exerting, involving skeletal muscles, which results in 
physical fatigue, often associated with physical sport”[20]. HCI research community is 
fascinated with the discovery of a new genre interaction experience which involves the 
combination of user’s physical activity (body/hand movement) with an interactive 
computing device. HCI researchers in games have proposed that the inclusion of bodily 
interaction enhances the player’s engagement and also changes the nature of that 
engagement, from an “emotional” experience to a “social” experience.[21].Muller also 
defines exertion computer games as “a digital game where the outcome of the game is 
predominantly determined by physical effort ”[22]. 
 
HCI researchers for a few decades now have been looking into human body movements 
and exertion activity involved in them. It was the novel idea of Mark Wieser’s 
ubiquitous computing which gave a new dimension to the human body interaction with 
the computer technology. Since then, there have been various scientists who explored 
this field with different purpose and perspectives ranging from focus to avoid injuries 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  19 
 
due to human body movement for computer interaction, to interaction with 
computational system in seamless manner. Each research approach looks at the 
interaction aspect of the body from a single perspective. It was hard to find any related 
papers that have the entire range of different viewpoint on the human body interaction 
in exertion activity with technology. 
 
Using a framework dedicated to design exertion activity/game, otherwise the 
traditional frameworks of a passively-interactive button-press computer games, can 
provide a greater understanding of exertion games helping designers and developers 
utilizing the various advantages of exertion activity and develop an actively-interactive 
game. 
3.5.1 A Framework for an Exertion game [22]. 
3.5.1.1 The Body lens 
 
Muller developed a framework defining a conceptual construct “The body lens” which 
allows conceive of the body in exertion activity such as sport/game from four 
perspectives which then combined together, which can be used to design exertion 
games.  
  
The human body is at the centre, surrounded by four layers given below: 
 
1. The Responding Body 
2. The Moving Body 
3. The Sensing Body 
4. The Relating Body 
 
With combinational results of these four layers it is possible to acquire a body 
perspective information equivalent of four complementary lenses capturing body in 
exertion. This framework inclines to Jacob et al.’s framework which depicts the 
contextual components in the interaction with non-traditional non-keyboard operated 
system [23] [24].    
3.5.1.2 The Responding body 
 
The responding body lens gives inner perspective of the body in exertion, i.e. view from 
“from the inside”, and how the body reaction and the resulting changes had happen 
internally due to the exertion activity the body is involved in. Such internal changes 
could be breathing is heavier, increase in player’s heart rate typically increases and 
sweating. These changes are not intentionally started by the player, but are due to 
implicit biological changes that happen within the body due to the exertion activity.

COMSM3100  20 
 
The below diagram (Fig.3) depict a pictorial representation of the body lens structure. 
 
 
Figure 3 
(Taken from Ref. [22]) 
3.5.1.3 The moving body 
 
The moving body lens concentrates on players’ change in muscular position of body 
parts due to the exertion activity involved. This viewpoint provides information 
regarding the human bodily movement characteristics such as intensity of the action, 
continuity in the action and variety in movements and also kinaesthetic sense (human 
ability to feel movements of the limbs and body) [2]. 
3.5.1.4 The sensing body 
 
The sensing body lens is viewpoint providing information about the interactions 
between the body and its play environment, linguistic context of surrounding. The 
physical objects and technology is used in the game and the surrounding environment 
plays a vital role in the game dynamics. With the addition technology into the exertion 
game, the objects used in the game comprise of both physical and virtual article which 
make them more interesting. 
 
 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  21 
 
3.5.1.5 The relating body 
 
The relating body lens is perspective on the player’s interactions with other participant 
and spectator during the exertion activity and how this effects on the players 
performance in a social play. 
 
“The body lens” provides social structure on how the body in exertion interactions can 
be viewed helps to see exertion games from different perspectives, 
 
 
     Figure 4 
 (Taken from Ref. [22]) 
3.5.2 Six primal themes of the framework [22] 
 
This framework is for exertion in digital games, so they adopt the fundamental gaming 
schemas of rules, play, and culture from the past research in games [25].The above 
diagram (Fig.4) depicts a pictorial representation of the body lens structure.  
 
? Rules give the fundamental structures of how the game has to be played. 
 
? Play provides the experiences of the participants of the game. 
 
? Culture proposes a high-level environment (setting) in which the game is played. 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  22 
 
? Rules: Uncertainty of exertion 
 
Uncertainty is a curial aspect of most games as it adds a suspense and surprise 
components in games making the game enjoyable and occupying action. In exertion 
games, greater level of uncertainty originates from exertion activity such as the 
exhausting players interaction with objects and environment unlike traditional button-
press digital games in which uncertainty can be inserted only through explicitly 
programming it in game dynamics. This will help the designers use the uncertainty 
originating from exertion activity and adding to the uncertainty from programming 
aspect to provide greater engaging play experiences. The sensing body lens provides the 
uncertainty perspective. 
 
? Rules: Awareness of exertion 
 
With the technology the player can either be given or concealed with bodily information 
such as heart rate during or after the game. This information of cognizance physical 
effort invested to play the game can benefit the player, like make him utilise his energy 
so that he plays in controlled manner, compare it with others participant acting as a 
source of motivation to perform better. The Responding Body lens perspective acts the 
core for source and effects of the awareness of exertion. 
 
? Play: Exertion in the form of expression 
 
Metagaming refers to “what happens during a game other than the game itself” [25]. 
Flow of expressions is conceived as metagaming. In an Exertion Game player can use a 
broad range of metagaming actions to express the bodily ability. Though they burnt out 
energy and might not help in winning the game, but enhance the overall experience of 
the game. The Relating Body lens gives the perspective of Exertion in the form of 
expression as metagaming expressions are intended toward other participant and 
spectators. 
 
? Play: Exertion rhymes with rhythm 
 
Exertion rhythm in game is the ability of a game designable to confine to a consistent or 
modelled recurrence of the bodily movements. From the moving body lens perspective 
rhythm is comprised of the continuousness of movement, particularly when compared 
to a just a single action event in traditional button-press computer games. 
 
? Context: Exertion puts the body at risk 
 
This scheme spotlights on the exposure of the body to injuries due to exertion activity. 
Injuries are a part of most sporting activities. If injured in an exertion Game, results in 
an unpleasant body reaction such as experiencing physical pain but it also provide a 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  23 
 
sense of excitement and achievement if we win the game by putting the body at risk. 
The responding body and the moving body lens can give a clear viewpoint on the risk on 
the body due to exertion. 
 
? Context: Understanding of exertion 
 
Understanding of exertion deals with the ability of a game design to help the player gain 
knowledge about their body. For understanding of exertion, two important aspects 
come into picture: knowledge and skill. Knowledge - information about one’s body’s 
response to the exertion activity and skill – is one’s ability to perform, that has been 
acquired by training and practice. All the four body lenses help in design to understand 
exertion. 
 
It is necessary for the player to understand the exertion and involve in the game 
accordingly. Four ways in which technology can be used to design games that support 
understanding of exertion are  
 
1. Allow the player to manually select of the difficulty level. 
 
2. Restrict the player ability in the game design to match this skill level. 
 
3. Design game so that participants with same skill levels are competing with each 
other. This can be achieved through networked play. 
 
4. Design for automatic change in game dynamics depending on the player’s 
physical capabilities. One such design could be to adjust the difficult level based 
on whether the player is tired or not. 
 
This gives a theoretical framework for exertion games with an exceptional focal-point 
on social play based .This framework comprises of 6 primal themes that contribute to 
the understanding of exertion games, which are developed with the 3 fundamental 
game elements as the base and provide different perspective view on the body in 
exertion from four different body lenses. This theoretical framework uses the already 
subsisting computer games theory as a base to develop with a consecrate framework on 
exertion games, using the combinational results of research from sports, HCI and 
computer gaming theory. 
 
This framework is for exertion games with limited social interaction. It has element of 
social play with respect to multiplayer game but it is not designed with keeping public 
space in the view. I will be implementing our game based on this framework and 
analysis; it can be used for designing exertion games in larger social setting.

3.6 Previous and Related Work. 
 
Exertion games, touchless interaction, interaction with large screens and context design 
for these urban big screens, are the trending topic for research in the field of HCI and 
Computer Science. Research has been done in the field to make Computer system in the 
human environment rather than forcing humans to get in the Computer system. The 
latest trendy researches in these areas are listed below. 
 
There has been enormous research done with HCI games as the research area which has 
resulted in innovative game design with revolutionary and new interaction concepts 
which has changed the way the game industry now looks at HCI. With the help of this it 
was possible for developer to design successful games like Warcraft III, Half-Life and 
various other games [26]. 
 
The general notion of fun and pleasurable experience has gained tending importance 
and has emerged HCI design. There has been an extensive research on Exertion 
interface and games by Florian Mueller and various other research .Their contributions 
are immense. Mueller had provided a framework to develop exertion games a social 
play. It can act as base to develop any computer exertion games [18][27].Various 
exertion games that have been designed, like jogging over a distance, Table Tennis for 
three and Shadow boxing, provide the ways to implement this the framework. Microsoft 
has designed games with the exertion factor using there Kinect and Xbox 360[38]. But 
these games are designed for an indoor play. 
 
In the field of touchless interaction researches have been made to implement touchless 
interaction in various complex situations like medical field. In [29] this paper, the 
touchless interaction has been researched to be implemented Image-Guided 
Interventional Radiology. In the past two decades there has been intensive HCI 
researchers resulting in wider perspective of new interfaces and interaction technics 
such as virtual and augmented Reality, Tangible and Physical Interaction, Ubiquitous 
and Wearable computing moving away from the traditional WIMP (window, icon, menu, 
pointing device paradigm. In paper like [30] which focus on the producing new 
interaction method and frameworks which is a path to develop tools for Reality Based 
interaction with consider body movements for interaction. Various inventions like 
Wiimote, virtual reality gloves [39], Microsoft’s Hand gestures and webcam [40], Sixth 
Sense technology [41] have let to the growth of touchless interaction. But there is no 
paper yet on the touchless interaction with large public displays. 
 
Anthropologist like Dr Kenton O’Hara has conducted various workshops [18][19] to 
analyse the interaction in public spaces. They have suggestions novel ideas for 
interaction public space which we will adopt in your project. In paper [17] they have 
designed a collaboratively played interactive game called the Red Nose game that is 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  25 
 
played on a public large screen and involves some element of touchless interaction but 
lack extensive physical effort hence doesn’t include exertion. 
 
In this project, we will be designing and implementing an exertion game, which is 
collaboratively played in public setting involving touchless interaction with large 
display systems. We will focus on the getting exertion activity, collaborative touchless 
interaction and public large displays on one single platform of a game.    
3.7 Summary 
 
In this literature review we have obtained the great understanding of unique 
characteristics HCI, exertion games, and touchless interaction and have understood how 
to design context/games for big screens in public setting. It also provides some basic 
information about linear and structural interdependency among the various fields. 
 
We have developed great understanding of HCI in general, the paradigms and current 
interaction techniques used in HCI, system architecture and the overall factors affecting 
the design of HCI. Gained greater knowledge in the field of touchless interaction and 
how it affects the HCI design. Also derived the on the role it play when designing digital 
exertion games .It was observed exertion activity places a major role in one’s body 
fitness and its tightly coupled social play, as social play contributes the performance of 
the player in the game. From the wide range of research in the field of exertion games 
evolved a framework that was developed Mueller which we will be adopting to design 
our exertion game. It was observed that fun and motivation play a major factor in the 
design of context for the big screens. 
 
The review highlighted the fact that currently there was no single paper/research that 
provides information for design of an exertion game to be played on the large screens 
public setting. There are literatures on individual elements but not for a combinational 
requirement of designing an exertion game with collaborative touchless interaction as a 
part of the game dynamics which is played on big screens in public setting. This is 
important because people like to socialise and exercise at the same time and it is vital to 
consider collaborative touchless interaction with the large screens, as these screens are 
proliferating in the urban public environment.

4. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION  
In this chapter I talk about design and implementation of an exertion game/system that 
was developed for public setting with touchless interaction based on Mueller’s 
Framework. 
4.1 Introduction  
 
With respect to this research requirement, I developed a game called, Human Pong 
which allows people in public setting to play sports/game/physical activity with each or 
alone. It includes a large display system like the BBC big screens in cites in UK plays a 
major part of the game setting. This gives a unique way to interact with the large screen 
and also start a conversation with others. All three aspects of the research including 
Muller’s exertion framework was considered during all stages of design and 
implementation. The game and its setting provide a floor of opportunity for 
experiments intended towards social gaming, as it has been successfully tested and 
played by more than 100 participants. 
4.2 Design of Human-Pong  
I developed a game which allows one or more players to play the game, in which the 
body of the player will represent the paddle and its position is determined by the 
human movement, which is captured using a camera. The main aim of the game would 
be to make the opponent miss the ball. Players can move left-right from the screen or 
front-back to hit the ball. Their movements will be captured using the camera and used 
to move the paddle on the screen. It requires a high level of exertion from participants 
through running and (perhaps) jumping& sitting. 
4.2.1 Design Goals 
The main goal was to design the game based on Mueller framework for exertion game 
and also making the game fun to play and create opportunity for interaction & 
collaborative play between participants. It was necessary to implement touchless 
interaction with the large screen. 
4.2.2 Game Dynamics 
The game can be played individually or in teams. A team (containing 1 or more players) 
can play the game against a computer. Each team continues to play until the ball misses 
the paddle a set number of times (tentatively 15 times but can be changed) and the time 
of play is calculated. The team with the highest playtime will be displayed so other 
teams/players can try and better that time. But the primary motivation is to make 
people move and get a workout. We anticipated each game to last around 5-25 minutes 
based on the individuals’ involvement and fitness. As this game requires greater 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  27 
 
physical activity suitable warning information and instructions was provided to them at 
the beginning of the game.  
The game could be played in 3 different modes. 
 
1. Computer versus Human 
 
2. Human versus Human 
 
3. Computer versus Human Team(2 or more people) 
The player movements are mapped to the paddle on the screen as follows. When a 
player moves left the paddle moves down, player moves right paddle moves up, when 
player moves front the paddle moves toward the middle and when player moves back 
the paddle move back. The mapping was designed so that it makes the player think 
before they decide moves adding an element of difficulty to master the game. 
In the game, the spot where the ball hits the paddle play an important role. When the 
ball is moving up, if the ball hits the lower half of the paddle the ball changes its 
direction to move down and if the ball hits the upper half of the paddle the ball 
continues to move up. When the ball is moving down, if the ball hits the upper half of the 
paddle the ball changes its direction to move up and if the ball hits the lower half of the 
paddle the ball continues to move down. With this game dynamics it gives the player a 
control to decide the direction of the ball in which the ball should move after hitting the 
paddle, making the game more interesting and fun also trying to maintain an element of 
surprise to keep the game lively. 
 
With respect to Muller’s framework, the above designed game satisfies all four lenses on 
the framework. The responding body and moving lenses gives inner perspective of the 
body in exertion and change in muscular position of body parts due to the exertion 
activity involved respectively. In this game most players are expected to experience 
some kind of internal changes such as breathing heavier & sweating as a result of 
running around.  
 
From the sensing body lens and the relating body lens viewpoint, the player has to 
interact in touchless manner with the large screen just by performing an exertion 
activity like running, jumping or sitting based on the player’s creativity and ability and 
also co-ordinate & talk to other player to play the game more efficiently. Since the game 
is played in a public setting it gives a great view from the relating body lens perspective 
as the player should perform in front of huge unknown audience. 
 
Based on the design experience it can be concluded that at present, the current state of 
the Mueller framework befits in developing the game/system we are intending to 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  28 
 
research, i.e. a computer game, with high level exertion required to play the game, for 
large screens in urban setting having touchless interaction with those screens. 
4.3 General Game Setting 
 
The below pictorial representation give a general/ideal game Setting for the above 
designed game. 
 
 
     Figure 5 
Such setting can be found in various cities like the one at Millennium square at Bristol 
harbour side, near the city centre shopping mall (Bull Ring) at Birmingham and various 
other locations. At the game venue we need large screen (5m * 5m) with camera with 
computer to run the game.  A mike and speaker would enable compering and music can 
be played during game to provide certain feel. Certain area in front of the screen is 
cordoned off as playing arena and the camera is adjusted so that it focuses only that 
particular area.

4.4 Implementation 
 
The implementation of Human-Pong went through various stages with feedbacks from 
lot of players. Human-Pong was first played with family and friends before it was 
exhibited to the public for research purpose.  
The Human Pong basically consists of three major components in the Game Setting: 
1. Large Display Screen in public setting.(Hardware) 
 
2. Camera to capture player movements.(Hardware) 
 
3. Game/Physics Engine.(Software) 
Large Display Screen in public setting. 
I wanted to run the game at one of the BBC screens but was unable to do so, due to time 
issues. Instead, I used a projector to replicate the Large Display system. Large screens 
play vital role in the public setting as they form a means of communication channel for 
interaction between people in a public setting. One of the requirements of the system in 
research is to be able to interact with such large screens in a touchless manner. Above 
research criteria lead to the use of the next component the camera to track human 
movements.  
High speed Camera 
It plays an important role in this system setting as it capture’s player movements during 
the game which is used to map the player position to the paddle.  As shown in the Figure 
[5] the camera is placed above the screen or the lower frame of the screen at an angle of 
45 degree to the plane of the ground so that human upper body can be easily detected. 
Game Engine 
This components focus on getting the exertion activity into the game. The video feed 
from the camera is passed to this Game Engine where the position of the human is 
identified using a Haar Classifier. The Game Engine is developed using C++ 
programming language alongside using libraries like OPENCV & SFML and 
Openframework, which can be run on windows machine. 
1) Opencv & Haar Classifier – Image processing for human body & position detection. 
2) Open Framework (videoInput) – capturing video from the camera. 
3) Simple and Fast Multimedia library (SFML) & OpenGL - Game graphics. 
4) Gimp, Inkscape and Adobe Photoshop online was used to draw images of the paddle                      
and ball

The above diagram provides just an overview of the main functions of the Game Engine 
and doesn’t represent the entire Game Engine. 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  31 
 
Opencv is an open source computer vision library is written in C and C++.Open CV 
enables building of a fairly complex vision applications at a faster rate due to the 
presence of its easy to use vision infrastructure. It contains more than 500 functions 
useful cross various aspects of computer science [41]. 
 “Openframework is an open source C++ toolkit for creative coding.”[42] It contains 
various libraries like OPENGL, videoInput and many more at one single framework that 
help for easier and faster development. SFML and OPENGL are simple and efficient 
graphic libraries that are used to develop the game graphics.  
As the game engine starts it loads the graphic of the game, which is designed using 
SFML and OPENGL with openframework. The options are provided to select the type of 
game. Once the game starts the main functionalities using the camera connected to the 
system it starts captures the live video. This grabbing a frame from the camera is 
implemented using videoInput in openframework. Taking the frame from the video, the 
game engine detects humans in the image and captures their position. This is done 
using Opencv and the Haar Classifier. I have used a various Haar Classifier xml file for 
this purpose. These files are not written by me, I have just used it in my game engine. In 
this we detect the player based on the upper-body. The game engine is coded to detect 
using the lower body and full body also but wasn’t used and has been commented in the 
code. The detectPlayer method in the game engine has implemented this functionality.  
Once the human position is identified it is then mapped to the paddle on the screen.  The 
game engine is programmed to ball move .When the ball hits the upper or lower walls of 
the screen it just reflects and continues to move. If the ball hits the side wall of the 
player missing the paddle that represents him the other player scores a point in the 
game then the ball automatically changes direction and the players continue playing 
without a break. This was designed to make the player get an exertion or if the ball hits 
the paddle the direction of the ball is changed according to the position where the ball 
hits the paddle as explained in the design section. So it depends on player on how fast 
the paddle moves and in which direction the paddle moves. In this way I incorporate 
touchless interaction with the large screen.    
This entire process repeated again and the players continue playing by running around 
till a maximum score is reached. This maximum score is set in the beginning before the 
start of the game. At the end of the game a message will be displayed informing who 
won the game, the score and how long the game lasted for. 
This game satisfies all the 4 body lenses of the Mueller framework and also the six 
primal themes of the framework. There is no time gap between each point. This is done 
to give the player maximum experience of exertion and make it easy to lose a point 
which will make the game more interesting. And with respect to the change of direction 
for the movement of the ball after it hits the paddle depends on where it hits the paddle. 
This can be decided by the player by altering his movements and make the opponent

curious about this adding fun and existing by maintaining an element of surprise. This 
also makes the game difficult to master. 
Since the camera frame-rate was very slow, I used free software called Manycam to get 
the input of the camera since this gave more frames per second. But even this was slow 
but much better. This doesn’t require any changes in the game engine code just need the 
software to be running on the system. 
4.4 Summary 
This chapter talks about the design of the human ping pong game. It was designed based 
on Muller’s framework. This chapter also touches upon the 3 different modes of playing 
the game and how touchless interaction was implemented. It also gives a snapshot of 
the general game setting and also a flowchart of the basic working of game engine. The 
implementation gives the technicalities of the game through game engine development.

5. EXPERIMENT 
5.1 Introduction 
This chapter gives an insight into the demographics of the participants involved in the 
experiment. It describes the process involved before, during and after the gaming 
process. It also gives the manner in which the feedback was taken through 
questionnaire and interviews. 
5.2 Participants of the game 
More than 100 people played the game. Out of which 63 volunteers gave a feedback by 
answering the questionnaire and the participants were personally interviewed 
together. Since the game was played in a public setting, people around at the game 
venue during the experiment played the game. None of the participants were personally 
invited. The game was advertised through social Networking sites like Facebook and a 
few posters were put up at the venue few days before the game. None of the 
participants had prior knowledge about the game. Since this game was designed to 
study the exertion games in public setting no special arrangements were made to 
contact people just for the experiment. 
Out of the participants who provided the feedback 39 of them were Male & 24 Female. 
People of all age groups participated with the youngest being 16 to the oldest being 38 
with the average age of participants being around 24 years with 65% of the participant 
from the age group of 20-30 years who provided feedback. 
Every time two participants were randomly asked to play the game from the crowd. 
First the participants played the game individually against the computer. Then the 
participants played against each other. Later the two participants teamed up to play 
against the computer. No participants knew each other before taking part in the 
experiment.

5.3 Rating & Feedback 
5.3.1 Questionnaire  
At the end of the experiment (after playing 3 games), the participants were asked if they 
could take part in feedback session and the willing participants were given with a 
questionnaire (9.1 Appendix). It has 32 questions distributed over all the aspects of the 
research and included detailed didactics. After a closer look into computer arbitrated 
interaction experiment/studies and based on the questionnaire used in those 
experiment [32] [33] [34], the questionnaire was prepared. The primitive goal of this 
questionnaire was to acquire clear &deep perception of how good the pair-participants 
got to know each other, how did the setting help the in participant interaction, their 
opinion on social exertion activity and how the game could be improved. Conversely the 
various precincts of the data from the questionnaire were accepted and the necessary 
additional methods like interview were used get the feedback [35].  
 
A few questions in the questionnaire were based on the experiment and questionnaires 
based on related studies which helped later to compare the findings and derive at a 
conclusion [32] [34] [36] [32].In order to handle the sequence effect questions were 
randomly posed in the questionnaire. A few questions were in part negatively 
created/presented in the questionnaire to avoid recurring reaction pattern [36]. 
 
To prevent the Halo effect [35], detailed didactics were also the part of the 
questionnaire asking each participant providing the feedback to devote their attention 
while answering the question. Anonymity and confidentiality was assured, and 
maintained. Except questions of a statistical type (like sex, age), rest of the questions 
were to be answered on a scale of +2 to -2, ranging from strongly agree to strongly 
disagree. 
5.3.2 Interview 
Participants who played the game and were willing to provide some more detailed 
feedback and wished to discuss with us more about the game, setting and the 
experiment were interviewed personally. They were asked question mentioned in the 
below appendix section 9.2 .Some willing spectator were asked general questions about 
the game and their suggestions about the entire experiment was gathered 
5.4 Experiment Process 
The experiment (game) was played in 3 different locations (Bristol, York and 
Bangalore) with help of family and friends. Due to timelines we were unable to run the 
game on the BBC big screens. Instead we used projectors to replicate the big screen 
effect in a public space. In all the three locations a compere hosted the game. No one 
was forced to take part or play the game. Since the game involved exertion activity 
suitable warnings were informed to the participants before they started playing the 
game.

Figure [9] shows the sequence of events during the experiment. The experiment is 
classified into 3 major events, are explained below.   
  
 
Figure 9 –Experiment Process

COMSM3100  36 
 
I used projector to replicate the large screen effect. At two locations we had the 
projection on white screen and at one location we projected on a wall. Due to hardware 
issues (Inability of system with 6pin fire-wire port) we weren’t able to use a High speed 
- High definition wire-fire camera. Instead I used a 3MP Wide-angle Microsoft camera at 
one location and 10MP Wide-angle Logitech camera at the other two locations. 
I was personally present at one location (Bristol) to conduct the experiment. At the 
other two locations (York and Bangalore) the experiment was organised and conducted 
with help of family and friends; but I was monitoring the experiment proceeding 
throughout with the help video calling on Skype. The experiment was conducted for two 
days at all the 3 locations from 9am to 5pm on each day. We reached the experiment 
location well in advance to make all necessary arrangements. I wanted the experiment 
to be hosted by a compere, so my friend hosted the game in Bristol. I explained the game 
to the participants and interviewed them after the game. Water was provided to the 
participants after the game.  
Before the Experiment 
Each time two people, randomly chosen from the crowd, who were interested in playing 
in game, were asked to step forward. They were given few minutes to introduce 
themselves to the other person. Since this game involved some physical activity like 
running, the participants were informed of the impact and were also auctioned. Then a 
brief description about the game was provided.  
During the Experiment (Playing the Game) 
In the entire experiment each pair played a minimum of 3 Games. First game each 
participant played the game individually against the computer. This is done to give the 
idea about how the game is to be played. Then they played game against each other. 
Finally each pair played as a team to against the computer. Each individual participant 
could play any number of games with as many people he/she wished to. The pair could 
have played as many numbers of games they wished. Most pair played 4 games with the 
last one either play against each other or playing as a team against the computer. 
After the Experiment 
After the game the participants were asked if they wished to take part in feedback 
session. The willing participants were handed over the questionnaire. Most of the 
participants completed answering to the questionnaire within 15 minutes. A few among 
them who were willing to provide more feedback were interviewed and their feedback 
was written down. The participants were provided a 5mins break before they were 
given the questionnaire. This time was used for resting and interacting with the other 
player by the participants.

5.5 Summary  
This chapter talked about the participants in the gaming process and the mannerisms 
through which the experiment was conducted. It gives a summary regarding the rating 
and feedback of the customers through various questionnaires and interviews. The 
gaming process is also discussed. The experiment was conducted in a public setting 
with a compere hosting the game.  Over 100 people played the game and 63 participants 
provided feedback by filling out a questionnaire and the team of players were 
personally interviewed together.

6. RESULTS & OBSERVATIONS 
During the analysis of the feedback provided by the participants through the 
questionnaire, the questions were broadly classified into group, with question based on 
similar topic in one group as it was easy for evaluation and comparison. With the insight 
to prevent the Halo effect [35] certain questions were negatively worded, however was 
reversed while drawing conclusions. 
Based on the five Likert scales [37], the feedback for the questions were rated and 
mapped to a scale from +2 to -2 as shown below. 
+2=Strongly Agree 
+1=Agree 
0=Undecided 
-1=Disagree 
-2=Strongly Disagree

? These numbers indicated that the game exposed players to a lot of exertion 
activity resulting in heavy breathing and also excessive sweating for a few 
players. 
  
? With respect to most players the first and the second games lasted for short time 
(around 4 -6 minutes each) whereas the last round was their longest game 
(around 12-15 minutes) during the experiment. Most players who wished to play 
longer were unable to do so because they were exhausted. This was seen during 
the experiment and most players acknowledged the same during the personal 
interview.  
 
? Each player who participated in the experiment had atleast involved in physical 
exertion activity (running) for a minimum time of 15minutes but an average play 
was around 21 .6 minutes.  Even though this wasn’t a continuous play, the time 
gap between the last 2 games for each pair of participants was less.  
 
? Each player played 4 games on an average. The duration of play and number of 
games played is directly proportional to the physical exertion experienced by the 
player. This provided the player a good measure of experience exertion in public 
space.

? About 51 % of the player experienced that the game was physically demanding 
where as 36% felt that it was not physically demanding indicating the game 
posing no difficulty to play and 13% of the participants expressed that the game 
was neither physically demanding nor easy to play.  
 
? Also 54% of the participants felt that they got a sense of their fitness level after 
the exertion activity in the game while 28% were still unsure about their fitness 
level and 18% opined that the game did not help them figure out their fitness 
levels. 
 
?  Around 61% of the player expressed that after playing the game it motivates 
them to get more involved into gym or sports assuring the finding that the game 
provided an experience of exertion activity to the participants. 20% of the 
participants said they didn’t get motivated and 19% had mixed feeling about 
involving themselves in more such physical activity. 
Overall from the statistical viewpoint more than 2/3 of the participants experienced 
exertion and also they were motivated to sweat-out more in the upcoming days. This 
was one of the main aims of the experiment and the game design.

? Based on assessing the answers to questionnaire, about 70% of the player got an 
impression that their partners who played the game alongside him/her as team 
or against him/her was a friendly person (Figure 40). Only 14% of the 
participants agreed that their partner was an unfriendly person and 16% of the 
participants were unable to figure out whether their partner was a friendly 
person or not. 
 
? Most of the participants were of the opinion that the other player seemed like a 
good person. These formed about 77% while the remaining 14% dint find the 
other player to be very good person and about 9% were unable to decide about 
the other player. 
 
? The game played a significant role helping players get comfortable with each 
other, which was easily seen during the interview after the game. This game 
helped two strangers meeting in a public space overcome the initial 
communication barriers assisting them to interact with each other in a more 
relaxed and enjoyable manner.

This provides an insight of how well the two participants got to know each other and 
their extent of believe on each other so that they can share their personal details. 
? About 46% expressed the fact that they didn’t get to the other person that well, 
where as 25% we unable to decide whether that knew their partner well or not. 
29% were convinced that they got to know intricate details about the person 
helping them get to know the other person. 
 
? On the side, 53% of the participants wanted to become friends with their partner 
which is great start to get to know the other person. Around 31% were not sure 
if they wanted to or not become friends with their partners. About 16% were not 
interested in extending their kinship beyond the game, expressed they didn’t 
want to be friends with their partner.   
 
? Even though half of the participants wanted to be friends with the other player 
only 22% were willing to exchange their personal contact details with the other 
player. About 14% were unsure and remaining 64% didn’t want to exchange. 
This provides important information that the game just acts as an ice-breaker between 
two strangers.

? About 73% of the participants didn’t have an interaction or a conversation 
before the game. Only 17% had interacted a lot before the game. This interaction 
was during the initial introduction time. 
 
? About 77% interacted a lot during the game. These interactions were either 
during the break between each games or the last round when they played as a 
team. This helped the players to get over the initial communication barriers. Only 
15% of the participants didn’t interact a lot during the game. 
 
? After the game most players had great conversation with a hearty laugh about 
their performance with the other player. This was acknowledged by the feedback 
as 83% of the expressed that they had interacted a lot after the game. There was 
break for about 5mins after the game (after 3 rounds) for the player to rest 
before they could take up the questionnaire. Most participants had good 
conversation during this break. 
It is very clear from the feedback that, two strangers who didn’t interact before the 
game ended up having a conversation during and after the game. One of the main goals 
of the game has been achieved.

? Most players enjoyed the 3 round (game), playing as a team rather than the 2nd 
round (game) playing against each other. About 66% acknowledged this fact in 
the feedback whereas 11% felt they enjoy both the rounds and the 23% of the 
participants enjoyed playing against each other. 
 
? Participants were having fun during the game and most wished they played 
longer. This was also seen in the feedback as 68% expressed the desire to play 
longer. Around 10% were not sure and remaining 22% didn’t want to play 
longer. When asked y so most of the player said that they were tired after the 3 
games. 
 
? In all the three locations the game was hosted by a compere. We asked players if 
they would have played the game without a Compere, about 40% said yes. But 
35% could decide on that and 25% of the participants said they wouldn’t have 
participated without a compere initiating participation.

? Due to the essence of the setting and the nature of the game we asked the 
participants where it was equivalent to playing a sport. Most participants expressed 
the fact that it was it was more of social game than a sport. About 79% accepted this. 
Hence it is clear that such games in public setting are not replacement to sporting 
events.   
 
? Around 70% of the participants had fun playing the game where as other 30% 
expressed it wasn’t fun playing the game. The game kind of provided a medium to 
having fun in public place the people opportunity to interact with people around. 
 
? About 52% expressed that the game created a kind of social bond with the other 
player and spectators who were strangers before to him/her before playing the 
game. This suggests that the game in public setting can act as ice-breaker and help 
kick of conversation between strangers in a public setting which being of the 
important aspect of the game design.

I wanted to get an over-view if the game was taken seriously or just playing more in a 
friendly and fun filled manner in a public setting as it will give some details and help 
designing further game. 
? About 49% of the participants said that the result of the game didn’t matter to 
them indicating that they played the game in less competitive sense whereas 
46% said that they cared about the outcome of the game hence they played more 
passionately. When asked y so most players during the interview most players 
replied that due to the fact that the game was being played in a social setup with 
many passer-by’s watching the game giving a motivation for the players to 
perform better. 
 
? When asked about whether they remember who won most games around 57% 
said no and 36% said that they do remember who won most game. 
 
? When asked about who played passionately and in a sense of competition around 
48% said the other player where as 38% felt they played.14% of the participants 
felt that both played being equally passionate. 
This indicates that player get under some kind of pressure when performing in front of 
a crowd even when they are playing the game for fun.

? This feedback from the user plays an important role as it brings into 
consideration an entire new genre of interaction with computers and large 
screens in public space. 
 
? Most players liked the touchless interaction with the large screen. Around 66% 
of the participants expressed their willingness of interacting in a touchless 
manner with the large screen. 14% conveyed that they did not like this manner 
of touchless interaction where 20% very not fully happy with it. 
 
? Also most players revealed that it was confortable and they enjoyed playing the 
game without holding any console. About 86% of the participants acknowledged 
the above statement. 10% of the players expressed that it made no difference to 
them and 4% conveyed their discomfort interacting in this manner. 
 
This is considered an important finding as to people like touchless interaction with 
large screens at the public space. This is will encourage designers to develop more 
innovative and interesting game in this genre. This was one of the important criteria for 
this research as well, which as be achieved.

This review provides a very important aspect of the research criteria. It gives the impact 
of public setting on the participant and the way it affected his/her game. 
? Firstly large section of participants, about 61% expressed that the comments of the 
spectator had a significant impact on their performance. While personally 
interviewing them most players said that it had positive impact encouraging them to 
perform better. Whereas 33% of the participants said it made no impact on their 
performance. 
 
? On the other hand, about 53% expressed that they were unhappy about their not so 
good performance because a crowd was watching them play. The good side of this is 
that it acts as motivating factor for the player to perform better and motivates them 
to exercise more.42% of the participants said they weren’t worried about people 
watching.  
 
? When asked if the game was mentally challenging, as in was the game setting 
haunting them in the back-drop in their mind when the player was playing the game 
affecting their moves, about 37% said No and 30% were not sure whereas 33% of 
the participants said Yes.

COMSM3100  49 
 
I wanted to get an opinion from the participants about a new and developing breed of 
gaming, the social gaming in public setting which could help to design and develop more 
game of such genre. 
? When asked if this game was more of like a social gaming, 59% accepted that it 
was whereas 14% were not convinced and the remaining 27% where not sure. 
 
? But the interesting fact was when asked if you would like to play more such 
exertion games touchless games in a public setting the response was 
overwhelming with almost 84% expressed their willingness with just 10% 
unsure and 6%  expressed negatively.  This is a great motivation to design game 
of social gaming genre.  
 
? About 76% of the game participants rated the overall experience of the game as 
good whereas 16% rated as neither good nor bad and 8% expressed as not 
having a good experience. 
6.2 Observations based on the interviews of the participants 
 
Apart from the questionnaire the participants were also interviewed, with intensions to 
give them an opportunity to put across their feedback about the game & entire setting in 
a better and informal way. These questions were almost related to the questionnaire. 
Most of the participants expressed that they have been playing the traditional button -
press computer games and video games and found a vast difference between the 2 
games. Some of the spectators were also interviewed to get their opinion as well.   
Most participants appreciated the idea of an exertion game in a public setting as one 
participant commented “This game is an amazing way to exercise, as running around is 
great way for exerting and it is also fun to play.”. A lot of participants expresses that 
they wanted to play longer because it was fun but were unable because they were 
exhausted after playing a few games. 
Large number of participants expressed that it was pleasurable and easy to play the 
game in a touchless manner with one of the participant commenting “Yeah I like the 
idea of the game, unlike Wii or Xbox, where you need to hold something in the hand, this 
game allows us to play freely.” 
Even though basic sound was played during the game, few participants suggested that it 
would great if some kind of leg-tapping music was played alongside game to set the 
mood of exercising in gym. 
Another participant commented” Great way to make friends if you are new to town as it 
is an informal beginning to social bonding” .Most players also expressed that this game 
helped kick-start interaction between strangers in a public space. Most participants who 
were introvert seem comfortable with the other person with whom they played the 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  50 
 
game during the interview and this was ascertained by the participants during the 
interview. Lot of participants also felt that there wouldn’t be any change in the way they 
interacted even if they game was played in a non-public setting. 
Most players articulated that this kind of game in public setting was fun to play and it 
was motivating as large crowd of unknown. One of the participant commented “It is 
more exciting and induces a spirit of competition when playing in front of large crowd.” 
This is a great motivation for developing more game of social gaming genre. 
One of the downside of the setting was most people were unable to decide or were not 
willing to participate in absence of compere. On the other hand more than 2/3 of the 
participants expressed the willingness and liking to play more such games in public 
space 
Most player complained that the detecting the movements and the ball movement in the 
game was slow resulting in a slight arrhythmic display. This is due the hardware as we 
used slow camera (low frame-rate).  
6.3 Summary 
 
This chapter contained the various outcomes of the experiment. It accounted for results 
that showed experience of the players feeling the exertion during the game, enhanced 
liking of the exertion game by the participants and helping interaction between 
individuals in a public space. Interviews provided a peek into the potential of exertion 
games and also recommended the certain information for future social games.

7. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION 
7.1 Discussion 
 
The aim of this thesis was to ascertain if existing Muller’s framework for exertion game 
could be used to develop exertion game/physical activity for a public setting like an area 
in front of a shopping Mall or city centre and how this setting affects the collaborative 
play & interaction between strangers in such an environment. It was necessary to 
incorporate touchless interaction with the system. Any kind of interaction or a game 
that is coupled with physical activity will enable better communication among different 
people rather than traditional keyboard-mouse game. A game of like this nature which 
includes interaction along with an engaging physical activity will foster this kinship for 
further communication between participants. A questionnaire regarding exertion game 
in a public space revealed that these kinds of computer centric games gave an insight on 
individuals’ physical fitness and also helped them in bonding together. 
In order to test Muller’s framework, I designed and developed a Human-Pong game. 
This game requires players to play a virtual ball game, with the game being played in a 
public setting on a large screen, and requires physical activity like running. The player 
playing the game doesn’t have to hold any console as it implements touchless less 
interaction. 
7.2 Experiment Outcomes & Finding’s 
 
The analysis on feedback based on the questionnaire divulged many statistically 
significant observations about the entire game including the setting. It was possible to 
derive at a conclusive decision based on feedback on all the significant aspects of the 
research.  
? The main conclusions derived regarding exertion related 
1. Most participants were experiencing heavy breathing or sweating or both 
giving them a sense of exertion. 
 
2. Participants experienced exertion during playing the game which made them 
more fitness conscious and wanted to involve themselves in more of such 
social exertion games. 
 
3. They liked the game and wanted play longer but were exhausted. 
 
4. Most participants expressed that this kind of exertion (involving physical 
activity) computer game is more enjoyable and fun compared to the 
traditional button press computer game. 
 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  52 
 
? The main conclusions derived regarding social interaction/social gaming 
1. Participants mingled and knew each other better after the game. 
2. The participants conveyed that the game by some means provided an 
opportunity for a highly substantial social bonding between them and also 
the spectators around the playing area. 
3. They wanted to become friends with the other player. 
4. The game helped participants as an Ice-breaker and resulting in having great 
conversation with other player and helping them understand one another 
much better. 
 
? The main conclusions derived regarding collaborative play. 
 
1. It was fun playing the game together and want more such games in public 
setting. 
2. Playing a game in public setting motivated the players to perform better. 
 
? The main conclusion derived regarding touchless interaction with large 
screens. 
 
1. Participants overwhelming enjoyed this kind of touchless interaction with 
the large screen. 
 
2. They enjoyed this kind of content to the large screens in urban environment. 
 
All these factors made the overall experience of playing an exertion game in a public 
setting great.  
With respect to Muller’s framework, the above designed game satisfied all four lenses 
on the framework. The responding body and moving lenses gives inner perspective of 
the body in exertion and change in muscular position of body parts due to the exertion 
activity and this was evident from the game as most participants expressed that they 
experienced some kind of internal changes such as breathing heavier & sweating as a 
result of running around. This gave them sense of exertion which was the fundamental 
objective of the game. 
 
From the sensing body lens, the player has to interact in touchless manner with the 
large screen just by performing an exertion activity like running which they said it was 
fun and comfortable. Players also conveyed that they co-ordinated & interacted with 
other player to play the game more efficiently and this resulted in social bonding which 
continued after the game. 
 
Finally from the relating body lens viewpoint, since the game was played in a public 
setting the player had to perform in front of huge unknown audience this had some 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  53 
 
positive and negative impact on his game. Most players were motivated to perform 
better and some felt bad about their dismal performance. It created a sense of social 
bonding between the player and the spectators. 
 
The game designed on Muller’s Framework for exertion games focus on all the aspects 
of the activity with the player experiencing an exertion activity to collaborative 
interaction among player during the game, which in turn helps them interact more 
friendly with each other after the game. In this we also focus on interacting in a 
touchless manner which received copious appreciations from the participants. Since 
this game satisfied all the research criteria and it was developed based on Mueller’s 
framework for exertion game, it can concluded that this framework servers as bases for 
developing most exertion games.  
7.3 Suggestion for Further Developments  
 
This study exposed some unforeseen although appealing results. These results pooled 
with the opinions from the interviews, formed the basis for following suggestions 
necessary for the design of such exertion games for public setting with touchless 
interaction with large screens in the future. 
? If implementing touchless interaction game use a high speed-high definition 
camera for detecting human movements. Also can use various techniques of 
Opencv like HISTOGRAM and CAMSHIFT to make image processing and 
detection faster than Haar classifiers which have been used in this system 
development. 
 
? The game can be extended with networking capability so that it played by people 
in different cities which help increase a sense of competition. 
 
? Include more exertion actions into the game like gesture detection. 
 
? Develop game that can accommodate larger teams since it is more enjoyable. 
 
? Add some rhythmic music to make the experience more enjoyable to the 
participants and the spectator. 
7.4 Conclusion 
 
This thesis has tested Mueller Exertion game framework, and has shown it can be used 
to design and implement games for public setting with included touchless interaction 
with large screens being valuable addition to the present technique for social 
interaction. The experiment demonstrated an activity which can be referred as a new 
genre calling it social exercising/gaming. The participants reported a significantly 
Collaborative Touchless Interaction 
 
COMSM3100  54 
 
dandier social bond between player and spectator when playing such exertion game in 
such a public setting. The participants also expressed that they had fun playing the game 
in a touchless manner and rated the overall experience as good. 
In accession to an exertion activity in the implemented game, it also provides a new 
eccentric world of social gaming which is tailor made for social interactions with 
touchless interaction being expedient for a public setting. This technique looks in the 
antithetical direction to most of the present-day passively-interactive button-press 
computer games with minimum exertion activity involved. It also adds an element of 
zest as it is easy to play, difficult to master since it demands skill, strength and practice 
with public setting being added onus on the mind.  
An exertion game on this genre in a public setting not only facilitates interaction 
between strangers but also gives a sense of fitness for the participants by adding an 
element of excitement with touchless interaction with the large screens, that 
proliferating our urban environment. This gives opportunity for developing new genre 
of game that facilitates social gaming. Mueller’s framework can be used to develop these 
kinds of exertion games for public setting which can involve touchless interaction with 
large screens. This was an interesting and successful research of getting various aspects 
of computer Science, like HCI and touchless interaction in one single platform of social 
gaming.

9.2 Some of the Questions asked while personally interviewing the 
participants. 
 
1) Will there be any change in the way you interacted with the other player, if game was 
played in a different setting (as in a non-public space)? If so in what  way? 
 
 
 
 
 
2) How much did the setting affect your performance in the game and in what way? 
Would the way of your playing the game be different if game was played in a different 
setting (as in a non-public space)?  
 
 
 
 
 
3) What is your opinion about such games in public setting as a way to exercise while 
you socialize? 
 
 
 
 
4) If you wanted to play the game longer, why so and did you end up playing longer than 
you expected? 
 
 
 
5) Did you like the idea and setting of the game? What is your opinion on various 
aspects of the game? 
 
 
 
6) Would you like to suggest any changes?
