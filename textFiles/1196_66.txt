Abstract 
With the trend that people rely on integrated devices, such as mobiles and computers, 
low power consumption has become a paramount requirement in recent years. 
Reducing the supply voltage to sub-threshold region is one of the effective methods to 
combat low energy dissipation as dynamic power reducing quadratically will supply 
voltage    . However, how to make the device work under sub-threshold region must 
be figured out and the critical parameters influencing the reliability of the circuit need 
to be studied. 
In order to achieve ultra low power at sub-threshold operation, we did a lot of 
research on sub-threshold technology and took static random access memory (SRAM) 
as the first case to study. This thesis is mainly separated into three parts. The first part 
is the introduction of sub-threshold technology including the previous works on 
sub-threshold design challenge, the previous sub-threshold SRAM design, and the 
method of analyzing stability. How to combat the challenge for designing a 
sub-threshold SRAM system and details of each part of the sub-threshold SRAM 
design will be introduced in the following chapter. Finally, reliability analysis of static 
noise margin (SNM) will be carried out to find out critical parameters having an 
impact on the stability of the SRAM cell. 
The main contribution of this thesis project is that we fulfilled two sub-threshold 
SRAM designs, summarized and analysed the reliability of the sub-threshold design. 
 
Key words---- SRAM, sub-threshold, reliability, static noise margin (SNM)

1. Introduction 
1.1 Aims and Objectives 
Current trends show that minimizing power consumption is a paramount requirement 
in the design of integrated circuits (Keller et al. 2011). Power consumption has 
become a principle design consideration as device sizes decrease and many more 
devices can be synthesized on a single chip (Calhoun 2002). Many emerging 
embedded applications require extremely low power compromising real-time 
performance. These low power devices are generally designed using sub-threshold 
based design techniques. Such techniques have proven to be useful for 
ultra-low-power (ULP) and low-energy applications since dynamic energy 
consumption is reduced exponentially with supply voltage     and the minimum 
energy operation usually occurs in the sub-threshold region (Calhoun et al. 2009). 
However, a major challenge in the ultra low power design of circuits, particularly in 
memory based circuits and systems, is reliable sub-threshold design. This is because 
low threshold voltage and aggressive technology scaling exacerbate the reliability. 
Hence, more research is required to evaluate the reliability of sub-threshold circuits 
and systems. This work will investigate the design and reliability analysis of a 
sub-threshold memory system. HSPICE simulations will be carried out on various 
memory circuits to find out critical parameters that affect the circuit reliability. The 
aim will be to design sub-threshold memory systems, find out critical charges at 
various threshold voltages and the critical parameters that affect the circuit reliability. 
Besides, MATLAB will also be used to analyse critical data. 
In order to investigate the reliability of a sub-threshold memory system, the 
background of sub-threshold technology and recent advances are discussed firstly. 
Then the SRAM sub-threshold design and reliability analysis are stated. Finally, the 
progress of future work is outlined. 
1.2 Reliability of Electronic System 
Reliability consists of the availability, capability and safety of a device and is thus an 
essential component of good product evaluation criteria. The goal of reliability 
analysis is to evaluate the inherent reliability of a device, find the critical 
characteristics which influence reliability, and pinpoint potential areas for reliability 
improvement. After targetable reliability analysis, appropriate actions will be taken to 
mitigate the effects of those failures. In order to better carry out further research work, 
we must figure out the importance of reliability first. 
Take SRAM as an example, we use it as a significant part of the computer. Lack of 
12 
 
reliability will reflect on circuit instability and design life decrease, which will cause 
not only extra costs but also reputation problems. There are a number of reasons why 
reliability is an important product attribute, including: 
• Customer Satisfaction. If the device has instability in the performance or has less 
design life than customers expected, customers will be unsatisfied and may not buy 
products of this brand again. While a reliable product may not dramatically affect 
customer satisfaction in a positive manner, an unreliable product will negatively 
affect customer satisfaction severely. Thus high reliability is a mandatory 
requirement for customer satisfaction and expectation. 
• Repeat Business. Losing the customer’s satisfaction and trust, the manufacturer will 
lose the repeat business at the same time. In order to get repeat business from 
customers, improving the reliability of products will be the most significant for the 
manufacturer. And this type of attitude has a positive impact on future business. 
• Reputation. Customer satisfaction crisis will cause a loss of company reputation. A 
company's reputation is the most important method to sell products, which is very 
closely related to the reliability of its products. The more reliable a product is, the 
more likely the company will have a favorable reputation. 
• Warranty Costs. If a product fails to perform its function within the warranty period, 
the replacement and repair costs will be additional expenses except production costs, 
as well as gain unwanted negative attention. The negative effect on profits will be 
very large. 
• Competitive Advantage. Many companies will publish their predicted reliability 
numbers to help gain an advantage over their competitors who either do not publish 
their numbers or have lower numbers. Increasing reliability will be the strategy for 
victory. 
From reading papers, we understand the importance of reliability firstly, and 
furthermore we adopt the unstable factors in the CMOS circuit from different 
perspectives. And more importantly, these will contribute to our further research on 
reliability analysis and searching the critical parameters that influence circuit stability 
and reliability. 
1.3 Ultra Low Power (ULP) Design Using Sub-threshold Technology 
From reading the papers (Calhoun et al. 2006), (Calhoun et al. 2009), (Keller et al. 
2011) etc. corresponding to energy consumption of a circuit, we will always find that 
designers are expected to explore approaches for the lowest possible power 
consumption, which is well known as ultra low power (ULP). To combat power 
consumption issues, lower voltage is expected to be used in devices. Both the static 
and dynamic power are reduced quadratically as the supply voltage     is reduced. 
13 
 
And the relationship between supply voltage and dynamic power dissipation can be 
seen in equation (1.1) (Wang 2010). 
                                       
                            (1.1) 
Where,      represents the frequency of energy consuming transitions,     is the 
supply voltage, and    is the load capacitance.  
The ultra-low-power performance can be achieved by reducing     to sub-threshold 
region, as     has a quadratic effect. And sub-threshold operation as the potential 
technology for large energy savings is being examined and used in ULP design 
(Jorgenson 2010).As Keller et al. (2011) mentioned, the minimum-energy operating 
point generally occurs near the sub-threshold voltage. Low voltage operation can 
markedly reduce the energy consumption of the circuit. And before we do the research 
on sub-threshold technology, it is necessary to introduce the thresholding technology. 
Thresholding is a method of separating objects from the background by selecting an 
interval (usually in pixel intensity) and setting any points within the interval to 1 and 
points outside the interval to 0” (Whitaker & Dorf 2005). Sub-threshold voltage is 
lower than the threshold voltage, and the details of sub-threshold technology will be 
introduced in chapter two. 
1.4 Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) 
Memory device, as an essential part of any computation system, can be categorized 
into read only memory (ROM) and random access memory (RAM) as introduced by 
Fig.1.1. Static random access memory (SRAM) is named according to storage 
characteristics of RAM and does not need to be refreshed periodically (Whitaker & 
Dorf 2005). And the so-called "static" refers to memory that can maintain and 
constantly store the data as long as this remains energized. However, the stored data 
will disappear when the power supply is stopped. SRAM is widely used in the digital 
world because of its faster, low power requirement and easy to control characteristics. 
We take SRAM as a first case to study in this project. And the details of read and 
write operation will be introduced later.

The current advance of SRAM has presented the six transistors (6T), eight transistors 
(8T) and even twelve transistors (12T), and the 6T SRAM cell is commonly used. 
However, when we use a low voltage operation for traditional 6T SRAM to get lower 
leakage power and active energy, there exists some limitations. Numerous articles, e.g. 
(Calhoun et al. 2007), (Kim et al. 2008) etc., have mentioned that using 8T & 10T 
SRAM can lift these restrictions, which will be presented and discussed in the 
sub-threshold SRAM section. 
1.5 Sub-threshold Design of SRAMs 
To reduce energy consumption, numerous researchers focus on sub-threshold 
technology and explore the limitation and potential of sub-threshold design of 
SRAMs. What has been examined is that the low voltage operation can indeed realize 
the energy saving and stability. 
SRAMs comprise a significant percentage of the total power for many digital chips. 
Besides, SRAMs leakage can dominate total chip leakage. Furthermore, SRAMs with 
lower     can reduce leakage power and access energy. Therefore, for system 
integration, SRAM must become capable of operating at sub-threshold voltage that is 
compatible with sub-threshold combinational logic (Calhoun et al. 2007). To 
overcome the difficulties of operating an SRAM in sub-threshold requires both circuit 
and architectural innovations. Considering the critical parameters affecting the 
stability of SRAM circuits, such as noise margin and device scale, the new detecting 
method and innovative SRAM are proposed and will be introduced in detail later.

2. Sub-threshold technology 
This chapter is about sub-threshold technology and is divided into five parts. Firstly, 
the sub-threshold technology will be introduced, and the following parts will 
correspond to the circuit parameters affecting the sub-threshold circuit. The recent 
advance and the future challenge of sub-threshold design will be presented later. 
Finally, the motivation of the proposal research will be expounded. 
2.1 Sub-threshold Design 
It has been discussed by Calhoun and Khanna (2009) and Kim (2011) that the 
operation of digital CMOS transistors using sub-threshold technology is the principal 
method to reduce energy consumption. To learn the sub-threshold technology well, we 
have read the book Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuit (Razavi 2011) which 
introduces the sub-threshold technology clearly. 
As the book mentioned (Razavi 2011), when we analyse the MOSFET, we have 
assumed that the device turns off abruptly as     drops below     . But for 
   ≈      some current flows from D to S still exists in reality. Even for    <    , 
   is not infinitely small, but it exhibits an exponential relationship with    . We call 
it “Subthreshold conduction”. The region where     is higher than the threshold 
voltage region is known as a strong inversion layer. And the area below the threshold 
voltage is known as the sub-threshold or weak inversion layer. 
For     greater than roughly 200mV, its formula can be represented as: 
                                  
   
   
                            (2.1) 
Where     is a no ideality factor. From this formula, we have seen that as     
falls below    , the drain current drops at a finite rate. With typical values of   and 
temperature,     must decrease by approximately 80mV for    to decrease by one 
decade (Fig. 2.1). 
 
Figure 2.1 MOS sub-threshold characteristics (Razavi 2011) 
16 
 
We can see that using sub-threshold technology in MOS devices can achieve a higher 
gain, which the exponential dependence of    upon     in sub-threshold operation 
suggests. However in order to meet this condition, only a large device width or low 
drain current happens. And this will be one of the challenges when we try to realize 
scaling device. 
2.2 Circuit Parameters Affecting Sub-threshold Design 
Reliability issues of the memory system cannot be ignored. And to find out critical 
parameters those affecting the circuit reliability will be the first task. From reading the 
papers introduced below, we studied and summarized the reliability factors including 
the following: 
2.2.1 The Conflict between Low Power and Reliability.  
In the digital world, low power (LP) device is an urgent need, and low voltage 
operation can markedly reduce the energy requirements of digital circuits. But it also 
causes reliability and yield to greatly reduce (Keller et al. 2011). To maintain LP and 
reliable stability of the circuit, device dimensions, adaptive body biasing (ABB) and 
the cost of potentially increasing energy per operation must be considered. 
Keller and Bhargav (2011) present a new method for digital CMOS library 
characterization and a new algorithm for finding the minimum energy operating point 
of digital CMOS circuits; with precise guarantees on reliability and parametric yield 
and gate sizing with a guaranteed minimum static noise margin (SNM) for any circuit. 
From reading this paper, we know that in order to guarantee the reliability of a design, 
intra-die variation and statistical noise margin data must be considered. After 
collecting statistical noise margin data and considering total energy per operation, 
they proposed the search algorithm and the reliable–circuit minimum energy 
algorithm results for 1M inverter test circuit are shown in Fig. 2.2. P (L, W) and N (L, 
W) mean PMOS/NMOS sized with length and width.      is the total energy per 
operation in a digital circuit. This figure shows each energy operating point status 
with P (L, W) and N (L, W) given for each point in nanometers. 
 
Figure 2.2 Results of the reliable-circuit minimum energy algorithm applied to test circuit  
(Keller 2011) 
17 
 
Random variation and minimized energy are important components when we research 
into CMOS circuit reliability. Calhoun and Khanna (2009) also give us the strategies 
to combat random variation and minimize energy for nodes below 45nm. In this paper, 
they refine predictive technology models (PTMs) to capture the scaling trends of 
low-power CMOS technologies and their effect on sub-threshold circuits. They find 
that there is a net improvement in minimum energy with scaling in the LP 
technologies. Although      is increasing with scaling, the improvement in delay 
results in a net improvement in energy. Variation fundamentally limits logic noise 
margin (NM) and SRAM data retention voltage (DRV).     and L knobs for 
minimum energy become more useful in scaled technologies generally, but targeted 
application of voltage knobs to specific circuit contexts are also necessary for 
maintaining sub-   functionality (Calhoun et al. 2009). 
2.2.2 Static Noise Margin 
From reading the papers, we realized that numerous researchers focus on noise issues. 
Noise trades with power dissipation, speed, and linearity make it be concerned as 
circuit parameters when dealing with analog and digital circuit (Razavi 2001). 
Keller, S., the author of the paper Reliable Minimum Energy CMOS Circuit Design, 
commits to mitigating the effect of lower voltage operation on reliability and yield of 
the circuit. He mentioned that he uses quantification and modeling method to 
calculate the energy per operation of a digital circuit. Besides, quantification of the 
variation-induced device failure rate is a considerably new issue that requires the use 
of noise margin. He use static noise margins (SNMs) to analyse memory cells and 
address the functional yield problem in sub-threshold circuit. The noise margin is the 
amount by which the signal exceeds the threshold for a proper '0' or '1'. And the SNM, 
as the name suggests, corresponds to a static form of analysis. 
In their research, SNM is calculated by way of a DC sweep and is independent of 
output load. Given any two gates    ,     (Keller et al. 2011), where     is 
driving   , the SNM is defined as: 
                                                             (2.2) 
                                                              (2.3) 
                                                            (2.4) 
Keller (2011) also mentioned noise margin in sub-threshold logic circuits when they 
examined the impact of technology scaling to 22nm on sub-threshold circuit design. 
To investigate the scaling of LP processes, they incorporated variability into the 
models, such as local     variation due to random dopant fluctuations (RDF). For a 
large circuit, parameters like delay and leakage current are less affected by RDF. 
However, due to inadequate SNM, RDF threatens the basic functionality of the circuit. 
So, in their research, they characterize the SNM for logic gates. 
18 
 
2.2.3 Potential Parameters Affecting the Circuit Reliability.  
Introducing reliability analysis is an important step in taking corrective action, 
ultimately leading to a product that is more reliable. Li and Qin (2006) used a simple 
SRAM circuit, 1-bit six-transistor cell with a commercial 0.25-?m technology, as an 
example to demonstrate how to apply SPICE to circuit reliability modeling, 
simulation, analysis, and design. According to the paper, there are two potential 
parameters which affect the reliability of the SRAM system: 
A. Hot-carrier injection (HCI).  
The main effects of HCI on the device electrical characteristics are threshold-voltage 
drift and transconductance (gm) degradation. They use SPICE simulation to prove 
that pass transistors in an SRAM cell receive more severe damages because of 
bidirectional HCI stresses. As this paper mentioned, after SRAM circuit design and 
device lifetime calculation are prepared, the SRAM circuit with HCI-induced     
elements was simulated at different stress times to check its functionality.     is 
only one parameter in HCI failure equivalent circuit model, and it characterizes drain 
current reduction due to mobility degradation resulting from HCI-induced interface 
charge and oxide charge. They made the conclusion that HCI had significant effects 
on SRAM-cell stability. Reliability design techniques for HCI including transistor 
sizing, gate topology transform, and input-signal scheduling are presented in 
Hot-Carrier Reliability of MOS VLSI Circuits. Norwell. (Leblebici & Kang 1993). 
B. Time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB).  
As Li, X.J. etc. mentioned, there are four topologically distinct oxide breakdown 
locations in the SRAM cell shown in Fig. 2.3 store-to-stolen, store-to-    , 
store-to-gnd, and gate-to-diffusion of pass transistors. Store-to-Stolen breakdown and 
gate-to-diffusion breakdown of pass transistors reduce the bias temperature instability 
(BTI) differential voltage and output swing; whereas breakdowns at Store-to-    and 
Store-to-gnd increase the leakage current at the opposite transistors and degrade the 
cell stability and static noise margin (SNM). Most SRAM cells become unstable 
without sufficient SNM.  
19 
 
 
Figure 2.3 Store/Stolen represents the 6T SRAM cell state (Li et al. 2011). 
In the paper (Li et al. 2011), they took the second step to simulate SRAM circuit 
reliability with inclusion of both TDDB and HCI failure equivalent circuit models. 
And the first step is to test HCI influence separately. The simulation proved that 
TDDB has the most deleterious effects on SRAM-cell stability.  
2.3 Challenges in Sub-threshold Design of SRAMs 
After reading the books, we have basic knowledge about MOSFET, SRAM and 
sub-threshold technology. Besides, the papers give us an overview about the current 
advance about sub-threshold SRAM design. However, the challenges in sub-threshold 
design of SRAMs still exist: 
2.3.1 Stability of SRAM Cells 
Researchers commit themselves to designing more reliable sub-threshold SRAM 
systems to adapt market demand for low power consumption. Although some new 
structures of SRAM have been present, researching the more stable and lower power 
consumption device will always be the significant challenge.  
The sub-threshold technology has been proved in ultra-low-power applications. 
However, the noise margin decreases as the supply voltage is lowered. And the 
reliability of circuits is facing a challenge due to the issues associated with low 
voltage and ultra low voltage. The characteristic parameters affecting reliability still 
need to be found and examined. 
2.3.2 Sense Amplifier Problems 
The sense amplifier is the critical component in SRAM design. The speed and power 
dissipation of the whole SRAM design is extremely affected by the performance of 
20 
 
sense amplifier (Wang 2010). Therefore, trying to design the appropriate sense 
amplifier circuit will be one of the challenges in this project. And the details of 
examining various sense amplifier circuits will be introduced in chapter3. 
2.3.3 Voltage Margin and On-off Current Ratio reduction of Sub-threshold 
SRAM Design 
Both Calhoun (2009) and Kim (2008) have mentioned that facing the ultra low power 
sub-threshold SRAM design, reduced voltage margin, degraded on-off current ratios 
and heightened sensitivity to variations are extreme challenges. When we try to 
reduce voltage for power consumption reduction, the issues introduced above will 
exist and influence the stability of the circuit. 
2.3.4 Reduced Number of Cells per Bitline 
As Wang (2010) mentioned, the total number of cells per bitline will be reduced when 
the conventional SRAM cells are used in sub-threshold design. This is because the 
ratio between       (read current of accessed cell) and          (leakage current of 
un-accessed cell) is reduced. The leakage current in one bitline is shown in Fig. 2.4 
(Wang 2010). Besides, as Verma & Chandrakasan mentioned at most 64 cells could 
be attached to one bitline if no other technique was applied. 
 
Figure 2.4 Leakage current in one bitline (Wang 2010) 
However, in this project, we will focus on only one cell in the column and do research 
on designing and examining the reliability of a successful sub-threshold SRAM 
circuit. Other components in SRAM such as pre-charge (PC), write and read sequence 
generation circuits, etc., are also to be designed properly and these will be introduced 
21 
 
in detail in chapter3. 
In conclusion, the design and analysis of sub-threshold SRAM for this project are 
facing great challenges. 
2.4 Recent Advance in Sub-threshold Design of SRAMs 
Memory, as the most important part in embedded applications, owns a large family 
including RAM, ROM, Cache and so on. Static random access memory (SRAM) is a 
type of semiconductor memory where the word static indicates that, unlike dynamic 
RAM (DRAM), it does not need to be periodically refreshed. SRAM uses bistable 
latching circuitry to store each bit. This project will investigate the reliability of a 
sub-threshold memory system, and SRAM cells will be the basic system to be studied. 
2.4.1 The Basic Component in SRAM----NMOS and PMOS 
The idea of metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) was patented by 
J.E. Lilienfeld in the early1930s, while it has been widely adopted in the digital world 
since complementary MOS (CMOS) devices were introduced in the mid-1960s. 
CMOS has the characteristics which can effectively reduce power consumption and 
fabrication cost as the book (Razavi, 2001) mentioned. Firstly, CMOS gates dissipated 
power only during switching and required very few devices; secondly, it was also 
discovered that the dimensions of MOS devices could be scaled down more easily 
than those of other types of transistors. 
With the development of CMOS technologies, it came to dominate the analog world 
as well. As said above, CMOS devices could be scaled down. And device scaling also 
continued to improve the speed of MOSFETs. Like Professor Razavi (2001) said, the 
intrinsic speed of MOS transistors has increased by more than three orders of 
magnitude in the past 30 years. In this project, NMOS and PMOS will be the basic 
components in memory system. 
A. NMOS 
Fig. 2.5 shows the circuit symbols used to represent NMOS and PMOS transistors, 
which are the basic components to build inverter, word-line enable switch transistor 
and even to implement a buffer in 10T SRAM. 
 
Figure 2.5 MOS symbols 
Fig. 2.6 shows a simplified structure of an n-type MOS (NMOS) device. When 
22 
 
        enough, carriers are attracted into the channel region to initiate conduction. 
The transistor is turned on, and a channel has been created which allows current to 
flow between the drain and the source.     is threshold voltage, and influenced by 
body voltage drain voltage and channel length and so on. And when         
   , the channel is cut off at the drain end. Further increases in     have little effect 
on the current.

B. PMOS 
P-type metal-oxide-semiconductor logic uses p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field 
effect transistors (MOSFETs) to implement logic gates and other digital circuits. 
PMOS has opposite polarity with NMOS. 
2.4.2 Sub-threshold 6T SRAM Design 
As the book (Rabaey, Chandrakasan & Nikolic 2003) mentioned, the generic SRAM 
cell is introduced in Fig. 2.7. It consists of six transistors per bit. The word line (WL), 
which replaces the clock and controls the two pass transistors    and  , enable 
access to the cell. Two bit line (BL) transferring both the stored signal and its inverse 
are required, which improves the noise margins during both read and write operations. 
The middle of this circuit, which is used as SR latch, structures two pair of inverters 
through     .

A. Read Operation  
The Electronics Handbook (Whitaker &Dorf 2005) defines the memory read and 
write operation as: 
When an address is present to a memory device, and sometimes after a 
control signal is strobed, the information stored at the specified address is 
retrieved after a certain delay. This process is called a memory read. 
Similarly, data can be stored into the memory device by performing a 
memory write. When SRAM circuit is writing, data and an address are 
presented to the memory device with the activation of a write control signal. 
Assume that a 1 is stored at Q. Furthermore, both bit lines are precharged to 2.5V 
before the read operation is initiated. The read cycle is started by asserting the word 
line, enabling both pass transistors    and   after the initial word-line delay. Then 
the values stored in Q and Q’ are transferred to the bit lines by leaving BL at its 
precharge value and by discharging BL’ through     . This is shown in Fig. 2.8. 
 
Figure 2.8 Simplified model of SRAM cell during read (Q=1,               )  
(Rabaey, Chandrakasan & Nikolic 2003) 
B. Write Operation 
Assume that a 1 is stored at Q. A 0 is written in the cell by setting BL’ to 1 and BL to 
0, which apply a reset pulse to an SR latch. During the initiation of a write, the circuit 
can be simplified to the model shown in Fig. 2.9. And Q’ side of the cell cannot be 
pulled high enough to ensure the writing of 1. The sizing constraint, imposed by the 
read stability, ensures that this voltage is kept below 0.4V. Therefore, the new value of 
the cell has to be written through transistor   (Rabaey, Chandrakasan & Nikolic 
2003). 
24

2.4.3 Low Gate Leakage SRAM Cells 
Due to the dependence of the leakage power on the number of transistors, and the 
requirement of large memory content of future system on chip devices, it is important 
to do research on minimizing the leakage power of SRAM structures. And Anand 
&Chandra (2011) describe two low gate leakage SRAM cell structures, which are 
IWL-VC and PP-SRAM cells. 
A. Improved Word-line Voltage Control (IWL-VC) SRAM Cell 
Based on the conventional 6T SRAM structure, a pass transistor P3 (which is shown 
and highlighted in a red circle) is added and select line (SL) is used instead of word 
line (WL). They use this new structure of SRAM (Fig. 2.10) to improve the timing 
performance. The SL is always activated before WL is activated. 
With the two extra NMOS transistors (NC1 and NC2, which are shown and 
highlighted in a red circle), the static power consumption is not significant. And they 
estimated that the extra power dissipation for a row of 128 SRAM cells is less than 4% 
of the total static power dissipation. This method lowered the gate current leakage of 
the cell up to 58%. 
25 
 
 
Figure 2.10 IWL-VC SRAM with Gate Leakage Currents when Cell Holds”0”  
(Anand &Chandra 2011) 
B. PMOS Pass-transistor (PP) SRAM Cell 
The second new structure of SRAM they present is illustrated in Fig. 2.11. This is a 
gate leakage current reduction method based on PMOS Pass-transistor SRAM 
structure. Compared to the basic 6T SRAM, the PP-SRAM cell has lower gate 
leakage. In PP-SRAM, two PMOS transistors (P3 and P4, which are shown and 
highlighted in a red circle) replace the NMOS transistors (N3 and N4). This 
replacement can decrease the gate leakage currents of the SRAM cell. 
PMOS pass transistors with high     and forward biasing method in PP-SRAM cell 
structure were used to reduce both the gate oxide direct tunneling and the 
sub-threshold currents. And they estimated by circuit simulation that the gate leakage 
current was reduced by 27% and the total static power up to 45% (Anand &Chandra 
2011). 
26

(Anand &Chandra 2011) 
2.4.4 Sub-threshold 10T SRAM Cell Design 
When we focus on low voltage operation, the limitation of traditional 6T SRAM 
cannot be ignored. Calhoun (2007) explores the limits of low voltage operation for 
traditional 6T SRAM and proposes an alternative bitcell that functions to much lower 
voltages. Fig. 2.12 shows the schematic of the 10T sub-threshold bitcell. Transistors 
       implement a buffer used for reading and removing the problem of Read 
SNM by buffering the stored data during a read access. 
 
Figure 2.12 Schematic of the 10T Sub-threshold Bitcell (Calhoun 2007) 
Because of the Read SNM issues, traditional 6T SRAM fails to write in sub-threshold. 
Calhoun, etc. tested that the 10T bitcell could solve the Read SNM problem, 
overcome the write problem and relax the bit-line integration limitation to allow 
sub-threshold operation.  
27 
 
Kim et al. (2008) also discuss the 10T SRAM techniques. They give an overview of 
traditional 6T SRAM issues in sub-threshold region .That is: due to the reduced SNM, 
poor writability, limited number of cells per bit-line, and reduced bit-line sensing 
margin, 6T SRAMs fail to deliver sufficient density and yield requirements in the 
sub-threshold region. Furthermore, they present a decoupled 10T SRAM cell (Fig. 
2.13) for SNM improvement. 
 
Figure 2.13 Decoupled 10T SRAM cells (Kim et al. 2008) 
First, they use 10T SRAM cell to eliminate the read failure caused by data-dependent 
bit-line leakage. Second, they utilize reverse short channel effect (RSCE) to improve 
cell writability, reduce power consumption, improve logic performance and enhance 
circuit immunity to process variations. After circuit simulation and analysis, they 
realized a sub-threshold SRAM with 1k cells per bit-line operating at 0.2V and 27°C 
(Kim et al. 2008). 
2.5 Motivation of Proposal Research 
From the review of research articles, we know that many emerging embedded 
applications use extremely low power with compromising real-time performance. 
These low power devices are generally designed using sub-threshold based design 
techniques. Besides, these techniques have proven useful for ultralow-power (ULP) 
and low-energy applications since dynamic energy consumption is reduced 
quadratically with    and minimum energy operation usually occurs in the 
sub-threshold region (Keller et al. 2011). 
However, a major challenge in the ultra low power design of circuits, particularly in 
memory based circuits and systems, is reliability in the presence of faults induced by 
electromagnetic radiation. This is because low threshold voltage and aggressive 
technology scaling exacerbate the reliability. Hence, more research is required to 
evaluate the reliability of sub-threshold circuits and systems. 
  
28 
 
3. Sub-threshold SRAM Design 
Memory cells can be roughly divided into static and dynamic structures. Static 
structure form cross-coupled inverters to keep the data (Wang 2010) and they use the 
regular fast logic process and do not require additional mask steps. Because 
embedded SRAMs have successfully accelerated the performance of high-end 
microprocessors, network routers and switches, we take SRAM as the first study case 
in our project (Pavlov & Sachdev 2008).  
The 6-transistors (6T) SRAM is significant in the digital world due to its superior 
robustness, low power and low-voltage operation. Therefore, we firstly focus on 
designing and analyzing the 6T sub-threshold SRAM. 8T sub-threshold SRAM design 
is also proposed to provide future comparisons analysis with 6T and critical reliability 
analysis.  
In this chapter, the 6T and 8T sub-threshold SRAM circuit design implementation and 
improvement will be introduced in detail. 
3.1 Conventional SRAM Block Structure 
An example of the basic SRAM block structure is shown in Fig. 3.1. This picture 
shows an N*M memory SRAM, where N is the number of rows and M is the number 
of bits. The SRAM blocking diagram mainly contains the row decoder, input data 
control, memory matrix, and column decoder and sense amplifiers. Their names and 
functions are listed as follows (Pavlov & Sachdev 2008). 
 Row Decoder: The row decoder gated by appropriate timing block signal decodes 
X row address bits and selects one of the word lines    –     . 
 Column Decoder: Column decoders or column MUXs (YMUXs) addressed by Y 
address bits allow the sharing of a single sense amplifier among 2, 4 or more 
columns. 
 Sense Amplifier: Dynamic latch-type sense amplifier with differential inputs. 
Several SRAM cells in one column decoder are sharing a single sense amplifier. 
 Timing Block: The majority of modern SRAMs are self-timed, i.e. all the internal 
timing is generated by the timing block within an SRAM instance. 
In the following sections, the detailed design for each sub-threshold SRAM part will 
be introduced. 
29

3.2 Detailed 6T Sub-threshold SRAM Design 
3.2.1 Conventional 6T SRAM 
The conventional 6-transistors (6T) SRAM cell is widely used in digital systems and 
the cell structure is shown in Fig. 3.2. It uses six transistors to store and access one bit, 
and the four transistors in the center (M1-M4) form two cross-coupled inverters. The 
cross-coupled inverter pair is the foundation of the static storage elements (Wang 
2010).  
30 
 
 
Figure 3.2 the conventional 6T SRAM cell 
As Seevinck (1987) describe, the cell area and the stability are two important aspects 
in SRAM design. The dimension can be reduced by fabrication technology scaling 
down, while the stability is always a significant issue. To evaluate the stability of an 
SRAM cell, SNM is widely used.  
As shown in Fig. 3.3, the SNM is defined as the maximum value of    that can be 
tolerated by the SRAM cell before changing states (Wang 2010). We added two 
voltage controlled voltage sources (VCVS) into the SRAM cell to detect the 
maximum value of    not flipping cell state. 
 
Figure 3.3 The cross-coupled inverter with noise source included (Wang 2010) 
 
Figure 3.4 SNM estimation based on maximum square (Wang 2010) 
As Wang (2010) indicated, read SNM and hold SNM can be found respectively 
31 
 
during read operation and at standby mode of SRAM cells. Besides, read SNM is 
much more critical than hold SNM in studying the stability of the SRAM cell because 
the former is much smaller than the latter. From the butterfly picture (Fig. 3.4), the 
SNM can be estimated according to the maximum squared inside the two I-V curves. 
The higher SNM, which means the higher stability of the cell, is always pursued when 
designing SRAM cells. 
3.2.2 Overview of the 6T Sub-threshold SRAM Cell Design 
The basic 6T sub-threshold SRAM design mainly includes SRAM cell, pre-charge, 
write driver, input/output, read-enable and sense amplifier circuit, shown in Fig. 3.5. 
To implement successful read and write operation at sub-threshold region, the SRAM 
cell transistor sizing must be calculated appropriately. 
As Rabaey, Chandrakasan, & Nikolic (2003) mentioned, when we analyse this 6T 
sub-threshold SRAM read operation, assume that a ‘1’ is stored at ‘Q’ point and this is 
the data we need to read. Firstly, both bitlines (BL and BLB) are pre-charged to    . 
Then the word line is asserted, and both pass transistors M5 and M6 turn on. Because 
a ‘1’ is stored in the cell, BL stays charged. However, BLB discharges through M6 
and M4. It must be ensured that the QB point doesn’t rise too high before      is 
discharged or M1 might turn off (the inverter defined by M1/M3 switches), and the 
memory cell will change state. The appropriate sizing of the transistors can efficiently 
avoid accidentally writing a ‘1’ into the cell. This is called a read upset. To prevent 
this, the voltage on QB will be dictated by the equivalent on resistances of M6 and 
M4. Think of them as simple resistors, which form a voltage divider. So, the 
resistance of M6 must be larger than M4 (there is a stronger connection from QB to 
ground rather than to the precharged bit line). The way to control the relative 
on-resistances is to have appropriate Width/Length ratios. In other words,         
has to be less than       . Here, we define the Cell Ratio (CR) as equation (3.1). 
                  CR = 
  
  
 = 
       
       
 = 
       
       
                     (3.1) 
To avoid a read upset, the voltage on node QB should remain below the trip point of 
the inverter pair for all process, noise, and operating conditions. CRs are usually 
greater than 1.2 (most microprocessor fabrications use a minimum CR of 1.25 to 2.5). 
We define the CR = 2.5 in this project. 
 
Another way to ensure the cell doesn’t toggle accidentally is to precharge the bit lines 
to say Vdd/2 so QB could never reach the switching threshold of M4 (remember, M4 
is only one half of an inverter and hence M4 actually won’t switch that easily). This 
has performance benefits as well, since the voltage swing is now halved, and the 
operation is hence faster (Rabaey, Chandrakasan, & Nikolic 2003).

33 
 
For the write cycle, assume that a ‘1’ is stored in the cell (Q = 1), and a ‘0’ is the data 
needing to be written in the cell. When write enable signal (WE) is asserted, BL will 
discharge to ‘0’ through M9 and M11, while BLB is still charged to ‘1’. And this 
causes the cell to change state if the devices are sized properly. 
The procedure here is to put the appropriate value on the bit line pair (‘0’ on BL and 
‘1’ on BLB in our example of writing a zero, which is identical to applying a reset 
pulse to an SR latch, which is what this circuit really is), and assert the word line. 
From our analysis on reading the cell, we know that the value on BLB is not sufficient 
to toggle the cell, because we explicitly designed M4 and M6 to ensure that didn’t 
happen. Hence the new value has to propagate through the other pass transistor M5.  
In order to write to the cell, the pass transistor M5 must be more conductive than M1 
to allow node Q to be pulled to a value low enough for the inverter pair (M4/M2) to 
begin amplifying the new data. This is the same principle we used to size M4 and M6. 
Now however, the bit line needs to remain constant, and the stored value to change. 
Therefore, M5 should have the lower on-resistance than M1. 
The writing operation of the cell is reliable if Q point can be pulled low enough, and 
the pullup ratio (PR) of the cell is defined as the size ratio between the PMOS pullup 
and the NMOS pass transistor (Rabaey, Chandrakasan, & Nikolic 2003): 
                 PR = 
  
  
 = 
       
       
 = 
       
       
                      (3.2) 
We can write the transistor equations (M5 is in linear, M1 in saturation regimes), and 
solve for the voltage at Q in terms of the W/L ratio of the devices. Because M5 is an 
NMOS (higher mobility and hence lower resistance) and M1 is a PMOS, using 
minimum sized devices for both should easily satisfy the condition.  
Typically, the widths of the pullup devices are sized at or near the process minimum. 
Longer than minimum channel lengths may also be employed to further reduce the 
pullup ratio. This is necessary since the read sizing of the SRAM cell dictates that the 
pass gate sizing should be minimized to prevent read disturbance. According to 
Rabaey (2003), the PR should be less than 1.8. We define PR = 1 in this project. 
In addition, the bit line capacitances     and      are in the pF range. Therefore, the 
size of the transistor connected directly with bitline will be 10 times larger than 
PMOS (M1 and M2) in the SRAM cell. 
3.2.3 Pre-Charge Circuit Design  
Before write and read operation are initiated, both BL and BLB should be pre-charged 
firstly. In this project, we use PMOS as PC switch, shown as Fig. 3.6. When PC signal 
is ‘0’, M7 and M8 turns on, then BL and BLB will be charged to    . Before 
write-enable and read-enable signals are asserted, the PC will turn off. 
34 
 
 
Figure 3.6 Pre-charge circuit for 6T 
3.2.4 Write-Enable and Read-Enable Circuit Design 
A. Write-driver 
In this project, we use M9 and M10 to implement the write-driver function. When 
write operation signal is enabled, M9 and M10 turns on. If a ‘1’ is waiting to be 
written into the cell, M11 turns off while M12 turns on. BLB will discharge through 
M10 and M12, and then QB point was pulled down to make M1 turn on, which makes 
Q point voltage increase to    . Therefore, a ‘1’ is written into the cell successfully. 
 
Figure 3.7 Write and read-driver circuit 
B. Read-enable circuit 
Pavlov and Sachdev use PMOS as YMUX signal switch, shown as Fig. 3.8. When the 
word line (WL) is asserted, the bit lines (BL and BLB) have discharged to a sufficient 
voltage differential, and then the SA is enabled by a high-to-low transition of SAE 
pulse. Shortly after that, the column MUX/isolation transistors Q6 and Q7 are turned 
off by YMUX signal changing low to high, isolating the highly capacitive bit lines 
from the SA parts and preventing the complete discharge of     and     . Then the 
positive feedback of the cross-coupled inverters Q1 ? Q3 and Q2 ? Q4 quickly drives 
the low-capacitance outputs ‘OUT’ and ‘OUTB’ to the full swing complementary 
voltages.  
 
Figure 3.8 YMUX circuit with a latch-type sense amplifier (Pavlov & Sachdev 2008) 
35 
 
However, Pavlov and Sachdev’s circuit output will not be stable, because the output 
line is connected directly with the bitline during the whole operation except the short 
isolation moment. Therefore, we have improved the YMUX switch to read-enable 
switch with NMOS Q6 and Q7, shown in Fig. 3.7. Additionally, because the 
read-enable switch is used to switch on or off the read operation, the improved circuit 
can be understood more clearly. When the operator needs to read data from the SRAM 
cell, the read-enable signal will change from low to high. 
3.2.5 Sense Amplifier Design 
There are various sense amplifiers (SA) used in previous SRAM designs (Wang 2010). 
The conventional current mirror SA is widely used as it has high sensitivity, shown as 
Fig. 3.9(a) (Seevinck, van Beers, & Ontrop 1991). Assume that a ‘1’ is stored in the 
SRAM cell, Q3 will turn on shortly after read-enable (RE) and sense amplifier enable 
(SAE) signal assert. And then the current of left side of SA flows to ground through 
Q3 and Q5, which enable Q1 and Q2 to turn on. The output will be ‘1’ as current 
flows from     through Q2. However, the current flowing from     through Q1 
will influence the gate (G) current of Q1 and Q2, which even changes the state of the 
Q2 switch during one read operation. To improve this SA, we separate the gate 
current control of Q1 and Q3, and the improved SA is shown as Fig. 3.9(b).

Figure 3.9 Conventional current mirror SA circuit 
However, because the current mirror SA has high sensitivity, some error signal may 
be amplified and produce the unstable output signal. This is difficult to control and 
will be markedly aggravated when it works at the sub-threshold region. Assume that a 
‘1’ is stored in SRAM cell which needs to be read, and the supply voltage of the 
SRAM cell is lower than threshold voltage. In sub-threshold region, the Q point 
voltage is sub-threshold voltage which cannot keep M4 turned on enough. At read 
cycle, WL is asserted firstly, meanwhile, the QB point’s voltage will pullup abruptly 
as BLB presents a positive strong voltage. And then, the current will flow from BLB 
to ground through M6 and M4. However, the differential voltage value between Q and 
QB is not so obvious. Additionally, the switch fluctuation of CMOS which is caused 
36 
 
by voltage fluctuation also can be amplified by current mirror SA, which is not 
expected. 
 
Figure 3.10 Unstable output signals with current mirror SA 
Figure 3.10, which is simulated by 
HSPICE, is divided into four rows: state 
of Q and QB point, WL/RE/WE signal, 
state of BL and BLB, and the output 
signal. It is obvious that the output 
signal is not stable. Therefore, we 
improved the SA with the latch type SA, 
shown as Fig. 3.11. This type of SA is 
formed by a pair of cross-coupled 
inverters, much like a 6T SRAM cell. 
Figure 3.11 Latch type SA 
When SAE is set to high, Q5 will turn on and SA begins to work, the output is stable. 
Fig. 3.12 shows the RE and output signal, and it can be seen that the read operation is 
successful, the data we collect are ‘1’, ‘0’, ‘1’ and ‘0’ as expected. 
 
Figure 3.12 Stable outputs with latch type SA 
3.2.6 Input / Output Buffer Design 
Inverter type read buffers are often applied in sub-threshold design, as it can satisfy 
the speed requirement. The inverter type buffers are also used as data buffer and read 
buffer in our project.

3.2.7 Write and Read Control Sequences 
After describing the whole architecture of the 6T sub-threshold SRAM and the design 
of each part, the read and write sequences need to be explained for future analysis. 
 
Figure 3.13 Write and read operation timing sequence for 6T 
To make the write and read operation timing sequence clear, we assume that first 
write and then read. The period of PC and WL signal are the same, however PC signal 
needs to be set slightly faster than WL signal from low to high, and lower at the state 
of high to low. This is because pre-charge operation needs to be stopped earlier than 
WL is asserted. When write operation is set, the WE signal is synchronous with WL, 
which is the same for read operation. However, SA needs to be set a little faster than 
read operation; therefore, it can be seen as little nuances between the SA and RE 
signal. 
3.3 Detailed 8T Sub-threshold SRAM Design 
After designing the 6T sub-threshold, we realized that more research needs to be done 
on 8T sub-threshold SRAM design. And then more reliability analysis on 8T 
sub-threshold SRAM design and the contrastive analysis between 6T and 8T 
sub-threshold will be examined and introduced.

3.3.1 Overview of the 8T Sub-threshold SRAM Cell Design 
The 8T sub-threshold SRAM design mainly including SRAM cell, pre-charge, write 
driver, input/output, and read operation circuit, and the schematic of the cell is shown 
in Fig. 3.14. To combat the challenges of sub-threshold SRAM design, this cell has a 
6T storage cell and a 2T read-buffer cell. Because the write operation and read 
operation for 8T are separated and isolated, the WL signal does not need to be set 
during read-accesses. In other words, the BL charge will not influence the data in the 
cell. Therefore, the SA circuit is no longer needed at 8T design (Wang 2010). The 
details of how write and read operation operate will be introduced in the following 
section.

Figure 3.14 8T sub-threshold SRAM structure 
To implement successful read and write operation at sub-threshold region, the SRAM 
cell transistor sizing are also needs to be calculated appropriately. Based on CR and 
PR calculation discussed before, the 8T sub-threshold SRAM cell has similarly sizing 
with 6T sub-threshold SRAM design. The CR is also 2.5, and PR is 1. 
39 
 
3.3.2 Pre-Charge Circuit Design  
Different from 6T, a new line named read bitline (RBL) is added into the 8T 
sub-threshold circuit. Therefore, PC needs to charge RBL as well before write and 
read operation, shown in Fig.3.15. 
 
Figure 3.15 Pre-charge circuit for 8T 
3.3.3 Write Operation and Read Operation 
A. Write Operation 
Write operation of 8T cell is the same as 6T design. Write access to the bitcell occurs 
through the write access transistors (M5 and M6) from BL and BLB. Here, we call BL 
and BLB as write bitline. When write data goes into the cell, write word line (WWL) 
signal and write driver (WE) signal are set to ‘1’ together. And then, M5, M6, M9 and 
M10 are turned on, which allows data to be stored into the SRAM cell (Calhoun et al. 
2007). 
B. Read Operation 
Different from 6T, the read operation is isolated from WWL and bitline. Read 
operation for 8T sub-threshold design is controlled by read word line (RWL) signal. 
Assume that a ‘1’ is stored in Q point, and QB = ‘0’. When RWL is set to ‘1’, 
read-buffer reads data directly from QB point, and low voltage signal at QB makes 
M19 turn off. Meanwhile, the current flows from RBL to output through M18 and 
export the value ‘1’ as expected. 
3.3.4 Write and Read Control Sequences 
After describing the whole architecture of the 8T sub-threshold SRAM and the design 
of each part, the read and write sequences need to be explained for future analysis. 
To make the write and read operation timing sequence clear, we also assume write 
firstly and then read. Fig. 3.16 shows write and read operation timing sequence, 
divided into four rows, PC, WWL, WE and RWL. The WWL signal and RWL signal 
are separate to implement write operation control and read operation control. The 
period of PC is set the same as 6T sub-threshold design. During write operation set, 
the WE signal is synchronous with WWL. Different from 6T control sequences, read 
operation has no relationship with WWL.

4. Software Introduction and Design Simulation  
The purpose of design simulation is to check whether the designed circuits work as 
expected or not before fabrication. And the circuit will be corrected considering the 
feedback from simulation once there is any error, which will prevent the failure of the 
fabricated chip to some extent (Wang 2010). The schematic of the sub-threshold 
SRAM design in this project was firstly simulated in Hspice with the newest 
predictive technology model in low power (LP) 45nm technology provided by 
ptm.asu.edu PTM website. And more size, such as 16nm, 22nm, and 32nm PTM LP 
model will also be simulated and analysed in later work.  
In this chapter, the introduction of Hspice and simulation of successful sub-threshold 
design has been described in detail. 
4.1 Introduction of HSPICE 
As simulation software, Hspice operation interface is introduced in Fig. 4.1. After 
importing the file, the basic two operations (which are shown and highlighted in red 
circle) are Simulation and Avanwaves. Using Hspice, we can simulate, check the 
correctness of our sub-threshold design, and calculate the power consumption, time 
delay etc. Besides, based on the data collected by Hspice simulation, the critical 
characters influencing the reliability of a sub-threshold memory system will be 
analysed. 
 
Figure 4.1 Hspice operation interface 
Fig. 4.2 shows the content for basic AND_gate.sp file. The Hspice file mainly 
includes file title, parameter setting for PMOS and NMOS (which is shown and 
highlighted in a red circle); pulses form (which is shown and highlighted in a blue 
circle), CMOS circuit model building (which is shown and highlighted in a yellow 
circle). Besides, the setting for clock, delay and power are also needed. Considering 
42 
 
different needs and research, other functions such as power consumption, time delay 
and etc. are written in the Hspice file. Finally, the predictive technology model (PTM) 
for CMOS should be added.  
 
Figure 4.2 AND_gate.sp file 
In order to grasp the application of Hspice, we model two simple gate circuits as 
previous work: AND_gate and OR_gate. The schematic of these two circuits are 
introduced in Fig. 4.3.

After building the model that corresponds to the CMOS circuits with Hspice language, 
the simulation waveforms are shown in Fig. 4.4. V (a0) and V (b0) are input signals 
and shown in first two row sub-windows, and V (cout) is the output signal.

From the waveform we can get correct signal feedback, which is an important basis 
for later analysis. The detailed simulation and analysis for 6T and 8T sub-threshold 
design will be introduced in the following section and the corresponding final code 
will be given in the APPENDIX chapter. 
4.2 Design Simulation 
We mainly work on 45nm LP model in our project, and the simulation results for 
successful sub-threshold design are shown in the following sections after the Hspice 
file programming work. 
4.2.1 6T Sub-threshold Design Simulation 
After thinking and solving the challenges, and designing each part of the circuit as 
introduced before, the 6T sub-threshold design with 0.22v as threshold voltage can 
work successfully under sub-threshold voltage equaling 0.2v (which is the supply 
voltage for the SRAM cell). The simulation results for both normal threshold 
(        ) and sub-threshold (        ) are shown as Fig. 4.5. The input data 
are ‘1’, ‘0’, ‘1’ and then ‘0’. Write operation has been set firstly, and then read. The 
PC, WL, WE and RE signals are set as introduced in chapter3 and shown in the first 
four rows in the screenshot as Fig. 4.5(a). The next rows present the state of Q/QB 
and BL/BLB, then the output results. When first read operation begins, a ‘1’ should be 
read from output at 120ns, and a ‘0’ for second read operation at about 280ns, and 
then ‘1’, and ‘0’. Besides, the output waveform for normal supply voltage, which is 
0.5v, is also simulated as Fig. 4.5(b), and the sub-threshold result shown in Fig. 4.5(c). 
As the screen shows, the final simulation exports the results as expected.

4.2.2 8T Sub-threshold Design Simulation 
The 8T sub-threshold design with 0.587v as threshold voltage can work successfully 
under sub-threshold voltage equaling 0.4v (which is the supply voltage for the SRAM 
cell). The simulation results for both normal threshold (         ) and 
sub-threshold (        ) are shown as Fig. 4.6. The input data are ‘1’ and‘0’, 
shown as Fig. 4.6(b). Write operation has been set firstly, and then read.  
Different from 6T sub-threshold SRAM design, the 8T read operation connected with 
a new word line named read word line (RWL). The PC, WWL, WE and RWL signal 
are set as introduced in chapter3 and shown in the first four rows in the screenshot as 
Fig. 4.6(a). The next rows present the state of Q/QB, BL/BLB and RBL (read bitline), 
then the output results. When first read operation begins, a ‘1’ should be read from 
output at 120ns, and a ‘0’ for second read operation at about 280ns. Besides, the 
output waveform for normal supply voltage, which is 0.8v, is simulated as Fig. 4.6(c), 
and the sub-threshold result shown in Fig. 4.6(d). 
As the screen shows, the final simulation exports the results, which is a ‘1’ and then a 
‘0’, as expected.

5. Reliability Analysis of Sub-threshold Design 
In order to evaluate the inherent reliability of a device, find the critical characteristics 
which influence reliability, and pinpoint potential areas for reliability improvement, 
the reliability analysis is significant. SNM as the paramount method to evaluate the 
stability of the system will be calculated in Hspice and MATLAB when we analyse 
the reliability of the circuit.  
In this chapter, reliability analysis of not only comparison between different designs, 
same design under different critical parameters, but also various predictive technology 
models (PTMs) technology will be introduced. And then, the critical parameters 
affecting reliability of sub-threshold design will be carried out. 
5.1 Comparison Near-threshold and Sub-threshold Design 
As Keller (2011) mentioned, to implement ultra-low energy operation, reducing the 
supply voltage below the process nominal     is necessary. Additionally, the power 
consumption and reliability comparison between near-threshold and sub-threshold 
design is significant. Before the reliability analysis of sub-threshold SRAM design, 
some research on near-threshold also has been introduced in the following sections. 
5.1.1 Power Consumption 
Energy reduction usually motivates sub-threshold design (Calhoun et al. 2009). This 
section shows the energy variety with supply voltage     decreasing. Take 8T 
sub-threshold as an example, dynamic and leakage energy consumption and total 
energy reduction for per operation are shown in Fig 5.1 with Hspice simulation. The 
threshold voltage for 8T sub-threshold design is 0.587v. To see reducing     effects 
on energy, we changed the supply voltage for the SRAM cell from 0.8v (which is 
normal voltage) to 0.4v (which is sub-threshold voltage). And 0.57v~0.6v can be 
considered as a near-threshold region. As the bar chart shows, the dynamic energy 
reduced quadratically with     decreasing, while the leakage energy increased 
slowly. As Calhoun (2009) and Keller (2011) mentioned the minimum energy 
operating point always occurs at the sub-threshold region, and the minimum-energy 
operating point depends largely upon the ratio of dynamic to leakage energy. 
As Keller (2011) mentioned, the issue of reliability is critical when facing the random 
parameter variation and CMOS circuits become less reliable as     is reducing. 
Therefore, it is necessary for the comparison of reliability analysis with changing    .

5.1.2 SNM Comparison Analysis between Near-threshold and Sub-threshold 
As mentioned before, static noise margin (SNM) is the paramount factor used to 
evaluate the stability of the SRAM cell. Drawing and mirroring the inverter 
characteristics and finding the maximum possible square between them is the basic 
understanding of the SNM (Seevinck et al. 1987). During read operation, M5 and M6 
are turned on, while in hold mode, M5 and M6 are turned off. Therefore, the read 
SNM is more critical than hold SNM in studying the stability of the SRAM cell as the 
former is much smaller than the latter (Wang 2010), as shown in Fig. 5.2. In the 
following part, SNM is always referred to as read SNM unless specified. 
 
Figure 5.2 Simulated SNM for 6T read/hold  
Take 8T SRAM cell as an example, as Fig. 5.3 shows, it can be seen obviously that 
the SNM of sub-threshold design (    = 0.4v) is much lower than near threshold 
design (    = 0.6v). And the table (5.1) shows the value of SNM varying with    . 
Obviously, the SNM will decrease with supply voltage drop. However, the power 
consumption is still the paramount requirement factor in the digital world (Keller et al.

comparing the stability of different cell designs and same design under different 
critical parameters.

5.2 Reliability Analysis of Sub-threshold Design 
To find the critical parameters affecting the reliability of sub-threshold design, it is 
significant to do some comparing analysis of different cell designs and same design 
under different critical parameters. 
5.2.1 SNM Analysis of 6T Sub-threshold Design 
As we mentioned before, the read SNM is much lower than hold SNM; the hold SNM 
for 6T sub-threshold design is decreasing as supply voltage drops, shown as Fig. 5.4 
(a). However, the read SNM fails (Calhoun et al. 2006) at sub-threshold region and is 
very small even at near threshold, shown as Fig.5.4 (b).

0.4  0.1581 
50 
 
As Calhoun (2006) described, many techniques have been reported to mitigate the 
low-voltage SRAM read SNM problems described above. To reduce bit-line 
precharge voltages and negative word line bias for unaccessed cells are two ways to 
increase the read SNM. However, forming a read buffer to isolate the internal storage 
nodes, Q and QB, will make read upset problem not happen (Calhoun et al. 2006). 
This method is the 8T sub-threshold design and the SNM for 8T is obviously larger 
than 6T, which means that 8T sub-threshold design will give us a more clearer and 
more accurate simulation feedback. 
5.2.2 SNM Analysis of 8T Sub-threshold Design 
8T sub-threshold design eliminates the read SNM problem of Fig. 5.4 (b), and SNM is 
always referred to read SNM unless specified in the following parts. As mentioned 
above, the SNM for 8T sub-threshold design is larger than 6T. And more reliability 
analysis for same design under different critical parameters will be introduced in the 
following sections. 
A.     Varying 
As shown in Fig. 5.3, the values of SNM decrease apparently as supply voltages drop 
and limited to    /2 because of the two sides of the butterfly curve. Therefore, the 
upper limit on the change in SNM with     is 1/2 (Calhoun et al. 2006). Fig. 5.5 
shows the butterfly curves at different supply voltages from 0.4v to 0.8v, which 
indicates the impact of supply voltage on SNM is significant. 
 
Figure 5.5 SNM versus     
B. Length Varying 
We investigate some critical parameters to improve SNM. As Calhoun (2009) 
introduced, increasing length (L) with constant width (W) as one powerful way to 
improve NM, can be seen in Fig. 5.6 (a). However, considering the size of chip, the 
value of L must be set appropriately. Table 5.2 shows the SNM varying with L and CR 
changing.

C. Cell Ratio (CR) Varying 
In contrast to     and L, CR has very little impact on SNM during sub-threshold 
read operation (Calhoun et al. 2006), shown as Fig. 5.6 (b).  
D. Pullup Ratio (PR) Varying 
The impact of PR on SNM in sub-threshold is also not large. Fig.5.7 (a) shows SNM 
versus PR in sub-threshold. Additionally, as Calhoun (2006) mentioned in the paper, 
Static Noise Margin Variation for Sub-threshold SRAM in 65-nm CMOS, the 
sub-threshold SNM sensitivity to any sizing changes is reduced, shown as Fig. 5.7 (b).

E. Size Varying 
The project we introduced before is based on 45nm LPPTM technology, and in this 
section, we try to use different technology to evaluate the SNM of the SRAM cell. 
When the supply voltage is lowered, the noise margin decreases significantly. Table 
5.3 shows the read SNM under normal and sub-threshold voltage in 45nm, 32nm, 
22nm, and 16nm LPPTM technology. As the table below shows, the SNM is 
decreased as CMOS is scaling down. 
Table 5.3: SNM varying with size changing

22nm 0.8 0.2943 
0.4 0.1467 
16nm 0.8 0.2932 
0.4 0.1415 
 
F. Temperature Varying 
Although the impact of temperature on SNM is not as large as    , the SNM reduced 
with temperature increasing from -40°to 100°. The reason why the higher 
temperatures have lower SNM in sub-threshold is that the degraded gain in the 
inverters that results from worse sub-threshold slope and PMOS devices weaken 
relative to NMOS at higher temperatures (Calhoun et al. 2006). Fig. 5.8 (a) shows 
SNM versus temperature in sub-threshold, and Fig. 5.8 (b) gives us the SNM vary 
comparison between    =0.8v and    =0.4v. It can be seen that the SNM of 
above-     (above threshold voltage) varies a little faster than sub-     as the 
temperature changes.

5.2.3 Conclusion of Circuit Parameters Affection Sub-threshold Design 
 8T sub-threshold design solved the read upset problem and has larger SNM than 6T 
sub-threshold design. 
 Supply voltage      and length have a significant impact on SNM. SNM will be 
larger with supply voltage higher. 
 SNM drops as size decreases in the real digital world; we should try to set 
appropriate CR to ensure SNM is large enough. 
 SNM decreases as temperature increases. Therefore, the temperature has an impact 
on reliability of sub-threshold design. 
  
54 
 
5. Conclusion  
In this thesis, an overview of sub-threshold technology has been introduced firstly, 
and then the 6T and 8T sub-threshold design to overcome the challenges as mentioned 
in chapter2 have been improved. The details of 6T and 8T sub-threshold SRAM 
design including the cell ratio and pullup ration calculation, sense amplifier 
improvement etc. and working sub-threshold model also have been produced in this 
thesis. These two sub-thresholds SRAM systems were designed and simulated in 
45nm CMOS technology. To compare different LPPTM technology on reliability of 
sub-threshold SRAM design, 32nm, 22nm and 16nm are also simulated and analysed 
for calculating Static noise margin (SNM). 
SNM as the paramount method to evaluate the stability of the system has been 
calculated in Hspice and plotted using MATLAB for not only different designs, but 
also same design under different critical parameters and various predictive technology 
models (PTMs) technology. We find that SNM will decrease as supply voltage and 
size of CMOS drops, which means the cell ratio (CR), pullup ratio (CR) and length 
have an impact on reliability of sub-threshold design. However, when we set the CR 
and L large enough to meet the maximum SNM, it is necessary to consider fabrication 
space at the same time. Besides, temperature also influences the stability of the design; 
higher temperature will contribute lower SNM. In addition, 8T sub-threshold SRAM 
design solved the read upset problems of 6T sub-threshold SRAM. These critical 
parameters will have a significant impact on designing a sub-threshold system. 
In summary, designing the sub-threshold design and anaysing the reliability of these 
systems will have significant impact on future research and fabrication. The future 
work will be introduced in the following chapter.

6. Future Work 
Since the read SNM and hold SNM have already been simulated and analysed, the 
write margin of sub-threshold SRAM design could be tested in the future as write 
margin also can be used to evaluate the stability of the system. 
Besides, this project mainly focuses on one bit SRAM cell design and analysis in one 
column, and the whole SRAM system can be integrated and simulated for more 
practical simulation and fabrication. The targeted device for this project is 
sub-threshold SRAM design and reliability analysis. However, after the sub-threshold 
SRAM design, the fabrication of a sub-threshold device is one of the main research 
topics in the future. 
Moreover, the design of the sub-threshold SRAM device with larger memory capacity 
can also be a part of future work.
