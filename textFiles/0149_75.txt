The primary aim of this project is to study the effects of network properties on the process of 
disease spread; especially the effects coming from community structure. Therefore, we will 
simulate two of the most typical infection disease transmission models SIS and SIR on various 
network structures and then find out the data relations. 
 
In our project, two main groups of experiments have been done, which tested the effects of the 
average degree and the community strength to three parameters of epidemic evaluation: epidemic 
growth rate, duration time and its final size. Additionally, different from previous work on this 
subject, there are three new properties: overlap rate, population flowing rate and three different 
community structured networks which are also tested in this project. To generate the network with 
these different properties, we use two different methods. Moreover, for different community 
structure construction, the algorithms will have little variation as described in detail in this paper. 
Furthermore, to decrease the bias of unstable results, every single experiment has been down 500 
times to obtain the average value.  
 
Based on this project, we found that the average degree and community strength play a significant 
role in network-based studies of disease spread. However, the influence coming from other 
variables such as „overlap rate under strong community structured network? and „population flow 
rate? are also considerable. In terms of the effects of different community structure with the same 
community strength, the hierarchical structured network expresses a notable ability to control the 
epidemic process.

Disease transmission in different structured network

1. Introduction 
In understanding the behavior of diseases, particularly infectious diseases, it is possible to arrive 
at an effective way to control an epidemic process [77]. In recent time, researchers have 
constructed epidemic models based on network theory that represents contacted individuals 
(includes by a direct and indirect connection), thus allowing for the possibility to simulate and 
express the spread process. Hence, network theory is considered indispensable to analyse the 
disease spread process [40]. Nowadays, most studies about the effects of network structure within 
infectious disease spread focus on how the properties of network, like degree distribution , edge 
weights and clustering coefficient, impact on the parameters of an epidemic, such as the epidemic 
growth rate, and the final size of the epidemic. Meanwhile, community structure is becoming a new 
study area for how it affects disease spread. 
 
? Objectives 
In our project, the aim is to understand how the network structure affects the disease spread process. 
In detail, we implement two levels of experiments: 
1. Spread standard SIS and SIR throughout static network with different properties. 
2. Simulate standard SIS and SIR model on the network along with community evolution events, 
which relate to the concept of dynamic network. 
 
Based on the simulation results, five questions should be answered: 
1. How does the average degree affect epidemic growth rate, epidemic duration time and its 
final size? 
2. How does the community strength affect epidemic growth rate, epidemic duration time and 
its final size? 
3. How does the overlap rate in network with overlapped community affect epidemic growth 
rate, epidemic duration time and its final size? 
4. Is the population flow rate a factor which affects epidemic growth rate, epidemic duration 
time and final size of epidemic? 
5. Is there a variance in how different community structures affect the epidemic growth rate, the 
duration time of the epidemic and the final size of the epidemic? 
 
? Structure 
This report consists of five main chapters. Firstly, the basic background knowledge describes the 
theory that will be used in this project, which is composed of two scientific fields: network theory 
and epidemic modeling. Next, there will be a briefly summary of the methods and results of 
previous work. In Chapter 4, the details of experiments which have been done in the project will 
be proposed. Based on the experiments statistics and data, a reasonable analysis will be provided 
in Chapter 5. Finally, the project conclusion and future work will be described.

2 Background knowledge 
2.1 Network 
2.1.1 Introduction 
„Network? is an efficient way of expressing system structure and relationship, and is all around us, 
including tangible objects in the Euclidean space, such as the Internet, subway or electric power 
grids, and neural networks [10]. Alternatively, it can be described as an abstract space containing 
collaborative relations between individuals or companies [10]. In academic areas, network is used 
as a basic environment or framework for many other studies, such as biology, computer science, 
economics and sociology. It is a young and active science based on graph theory. To be exact, 
network theory uses the graphs as a representation tool for the connection or relations between 
discrete objects. In recent times, a lot of models based on network theory have been implemented, 
such as information networks, social networks and biological networks. In the case of this study, 
we will focus on the social network, which is defined as a structure made up of individuals tied by 
one or more interdependency, such as common interests, friendship, relationships of beliefs or 
sexual relationships [38]. 
2.1.2 Social network theory 
In terms of social network theory, the social aspect can be considered as a set of people or 
organizations with connections or interactions between them [78, 86]. This theory aims at 
analyzing social relationship represented by network structure that consists of nodes and edges. 
These relationships include business between companies [52, 60], friendships between individuals 
[61], intermarriages between families [69] and so on. In a social network graph, the nodes are 
individuals or actors within the networks, while the edges are the relationships between them. 
 
Different from traditional sociological studies, which focus on the effects or functions of 
individual actors that consist of the network, the social network theory produces an alternative 
view, where the relationships between the individuals are more important than the attributes of 
individuals themselves [55]. This approach has turned out to be useful for explaining many 
real-world phenomena like news and rumours, diffusion of innovations [21], markets exchange 
relations [81]. Similarly, it has also been used to analyse the spread of both infectious diseases 
and health-related behaviours studied within the sphere of medical sociology [89]. 
 
In the real world, social network is based on graph theory and belongs to complex network 
structure field, without trivial topological characters. In other words, this kind of network cannot 
stand by purely regular or random graphs. During the last few years, scientists have tried to find 
out how social networks have both the properties shared with non-social networks, such as the 
World Wide Web, biological networks [23, 68], and the distinctive properties which make social

networks different. In previous areas research has explored the small-world effect [88], and the 
trend of a network to evolve into a scale-free state that is characterised by heavy tail degree 
distribution [1]. While the latter part focuses on network clustering or transitivity. Stated by 
Newman?s research [65], the clustering as a result of some social mechanisms is not significant in 
non-social networks. In addition, community structure has been found and taken into 
consideration as a symbolised property in social network studies. 
2.1.3 Properties of social network 
To analyse the network, firstly, its properties need to be considered. This is because these 
properties will dramatically affect the whole structure of the networks. In other words, to present 
these properties is a kind of way to represent the network. Hence, we can allow these properties to 
be variable parameters to describe or represent different networks. This subsection will illustrate 
the features that appear in common networks of many different types.  
2.1.3.1 Small-world effect 
In real networks, even though most member nodes are not neighbours with each other, they can be 
reached from every other node only by a few steps or hops. This is called small-world effect, which 
has been experimentally proved by Stanley Milgram in 1960s, and more rigorously proved in a 
mathematical way by Poll and Kochen [74].

The properties measured are: total number of vertices; total number of edges; average degree and 
average path L. 
 
To give the exact mathematical description, we use L to donate the mean distance between nodes or 
vertex in an undirected network: 
? =
1
1
2
?(?+1)
∑ ????≥?   (2.1) 
 
where dij stands for the distance from node i to node j. If a network has small-world feature, the 
value of L will grow in speed of log(N), where N is the population size. Recently, the “small-world 
effect” has been given a more exact meaning: if the value L scales slower with the network size N 
for a fixed mean degree, this network has the attribute of the small-world effect [68].  
 
To give some real examples to illustrate this phenomenon, in table 2.1, a number of features of 
different types of real networks have been shown. As we can observe, the value of L in all cases is 
much smaller than the number of total nodes in a graph, which means every node in the network 
can be reached from every other node through quite a short path. 
 
This property is very significant and useful when compared with many other networks, including 
random graph, whose L value increases exponentially with population size N. For instance, if one 
is doing the research on information spreading across a network, the small-world effects is one of 
the main reasons that leads to a much faster diffusion speed. 
2.1.3.2 Degree distribution 
“Degree” is a very important characteristic in graph or network theory, because it affects a lot of 
other features that lead to an impact on the structure of network. First of all, a definition of “degree” 
of a graph: the degree is a characteristic for the vertices in a network, which stands for the number 
of the edges incidentally or connected to a specific vertex. 
 
The most basic topological characterization is “degree distributions”, which is denoted as pk 
which stands for the proportion of vertices within the network having degree k or, equivalently, 
the probability that a node chosen uniformly at random has degree k [10]. Mathematically, if 
there are N nodes or vertices in a network and Nk stands for the number of them who have degree 
k, we get the degree distribution: 
 ? =
  
 
  (2.2) 
 
Another way to represent the same information, degree distribution, is to present the degree in the 
form of a cumulative distribution function: 
 ? = ∑  ??
∞
??=?   (2.3)

Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
Both of the two ways have advantages and disadvantages [68]. For the first method, it can give a 
clear and direct visualisation of the distribution, which have no interaction between any 
neighbouring points in the plot [68]. As a comparison, the second method can present all the 
original data. Additionally, the cumulative way also decreases the noise.  
 
After giving the definition, some typical degree distribution will be exhibited. The simplest version 
of degree distribution in a random graph studied by Erdos and Renyi [28, 29], has every edge 
present or removed in an equal probability. Therefore, the degree distribution is Poisson or 
binomial in a finite network [68]. By contrast, the networks in the real-world are much more 
complex than the random one. As showed in figure 2.1 (b), degree distribution represents far away 
from binomial distribution and, furthermore, is highly right-skewed, which means the shape of the 
distribution has a long right tail making the value much greater than the mean value. One of them is 
called power-law distribution that most types of network utilise.

2.1.3.3 Clustering coefficient 
One more significant property for a complex network is clustering, also known as transitivity. It is 
a typical property of acquaintance networks. In graph or network theory, a clustering coefficient 
can be used to present the likelihood of nodes in a network which tend to cluster together [86]. In 
terms of social networks, the clustering represents a phenomenon that two of your friends are also 
likely to be friends with each other. Evidence from research done by Watts and Strogatz suggests 
that in most real-world networks, especially in social networks, nodes have the tendency to get 
together and create tightly-woven groups [88]. In addition, this property in real-world networks is 
more obvious and significant than in a random network [39].

Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
To consider the clustering coefficient in a geometrical way, it means the presence of a high 
number of triangles [10]. Mathematically, there are two points of view to illustrate it: the global 
and the local. 
 
? Global clustering coefficient 
The first attempt to measure it was by Luce and Perry [22]: 
? =
3?number of trangles in the network
number of connected triples of vertices
  (2.4) 
 
Here a “triple” means three vertices that are tied by two undirected edges. A triangle has three 
triplets. We give an example in fig 2.2: 
 
 
Fig 2.2 this simple network has six triples and one triangle, hence the global clustering coefficient: 
? ? ?/? =
?
?
. For every individual vertices (from left to right), their clustering coefficient is: 1, 1, 
?
?
, 0, 0, 
respectively. And the average value is ? =  
?
??
 
 
? Local clustering coefficient 
An alternative way to define the clustering coefficient is to refer to the local value proposed by 
Watts and Strogatz [88]. A quantity  ??  (the clustering coefficient of node i) representing how 
likely ajk = 1 for two neighbors j and k of node i. Its value equals the ratio between the number of 
edges ei in sub graph of node i and ki(ki-1)/2, where ki donates the degree of node i, the 
formulation is given below in 2.5 [87, 88] and 2.6 [88]: 
 
?? =
2??
??(???1)
= 
∑ ??????????,?
??(???1)
  (2.5) 
 
?? =
number of trangles inclucde vertex i
number of connected triples inclucde vertex i
  (2.6) 
 
When a vertex has degree 0 or 1, we put ?? = 0. Furthermore, we denote the average clustering 
coefficient for the network in function 2.7, and give an example as in fig 2.2:

2.1.3.4 Community structure 
The last property we will introduce here is community structure, which is widely detected in most 
social networks [30, 86]. It is a concept that individuals in a network tend to concentrate in a few 
subgroup. This trend allows the groups of vertices connected more densely internally than 
connections between groups. Moreover, based on the notion of community, we elicit the 
definition of “clique”. A clique is a complete sub graph of three or more nodes. It is a strong 
situation of community [10]. 
 
Fig 2.3 in graph G(n,m), a community is a sub graph G
’(n’,m’), whose nodes are connected tightly. 
(Source form Girvan, M., and M. E. J. Newman, 2004, ref. [66]) 
 
To find communities in network is quite useful to identify substructures or components in a 
network that provide an insight of network function affects each other [33]. Additionally, this 
property will affect a lot of activities on the network, such as disease spread [59] or rumours 
propaganda. 
2.1.4 Typical real social network 
From now on, we have concentrated on the basic knowledge of the network about its properties and 
where and why we will use these. In this subsection, some real network structure will be presented, 
which can show the network concept in a visual way. Especially, the property of community 
structure is the focus.  
 
Firstly, we show a network of collaborations of scientists working for the Santa Fe institute studied 
by Girvan and Newman in Fig 2.4. It has 271 vertices which represent each scientist in residence 
Disease transmission in different structured network  
8 
Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
here from 1999to 2000, the edges are drawn between co-operators. As we can see from the figure, 
the network has an obvious group-layout. It has a strong density of connections within the research 
group, whereas few connections between each groups. 
 
Fig 2.4 Collaboration network between scientists  
(Source form Girvan, M., and M. E. J. Newman, 2002, ref. [33]) 
 
Next, Fig 2.5 shows one of the most famous networks for study. These are data collected from the 
members of a university karate club over two years by Wayne Zachary. During these study years, 
there was a big disagreement between the club?s instructor and administrator, which finally lead 
to the instructor?s leaving and taking about a half of the original members to start a new club. As 
showed in the picture, the whole network is divided into two main aggregations. One group is 
almost around node 1 and another is around vertex 33 and 34. But different from the first 
community structure, firstly, inside the community, there is one hub node; secondly, between the 
two groups, a number of connections exist between the side (not hub) nodes.

(Source form Zachary W. 1977, ref. [92])

The next example comes from World Wide Web. In the network, we consider the webpage as 
nodes and hyperlinks as edges. Seeing from fig. 2.6, the degree distribution is accounted as 
power-law distribution. Also, similar to the previous network structure, there are hub nodes for 
every subgroup. But the difference is that groups tend to be connected by hub nodes, not side nodes.  
 
Fig 2.6 Community structure in technological networks 
 (source from Newman and Girvan, 2004, ref. [66]). 
 
Furthermore, a network with overlap community structure will be illustrated. In fig 2.7, we show a 
network for word association derived from “bright” [64]. This kind of structure is suitable for some 
real-world networks consisting of individuals who belong to more than one subgroup [35].

 (source from Palla et al., 2005, ref. [37])

Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
Finally, we exhibit a hierarchical community structure in Fig 2.8. As we can see, 
hierarchical-community network is not a network with simple overlapped communities. They 
express the phenomena that subgroups exist inside group. Closely woven relationships in small 
communities can make a big community. 
 
Fig 2.8 a network with a hierarchical structure. 
(source from Andrea et al., 2009, ref. [45]) 
 
In addition, to focus on disease spread, Bearman and his group provide four typical community 
structures: core infection model, inverse core model, bridge between disjoint groups model and 
spanning tree [8]. These models are similar to the examples shown above but have more specific 
background. 
2.1.5 Algorithm for artificial network 
To implement the study based on network theory essentially means we need a well-defined 
network with clear structure and, meanwhile, all the properties of the network should be 
controlled. Ideally, we can find the real network instances to launch experiments, but it is hard to 
control every parameter. Hence, some artificial networks with the specific characteristics appear. 
In this section, some typical artificial network will be constructed using different methods.  
2.1.5.1 Random graph 
Random network was the first artificial network was made in 1959 by Erdös and Rényi which 
was named ER random graph. It is based on the probabilistic theory. In their papers, the network 
was generated with N nodes and K edges which denote as GN,K. To construct the network, the first 
step is initialing N disconnected nodes. Next, they connect pairs of randomly selected nodes until 
the number of links equals K [27]. Using this way, the given network is only one result of many 
possible outcomes. 
 
An alternative procedure to generate random model is by connecting each couple of nodes with a 
Disease transmission in different structured network  
11 
Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
probability p, where 0<p<1. To compare with the first method, it has probability p
k
(1-p)
N(N-1)/2-K
 to 
get K edges in graph [11,28]. And in addition, it is an easier analytical calculation than the 
previous method. 
2.1.5.2 Small-world network 
Small-world network is a most-studied model to simulate the real-world. It has small-world 
property mentioned in section 2.1.3.1. To construct a small-world network, we can build it based 
on a low dimensional regular lattice, which consisted by L vertices with connections between the 
nearest k neighbors. And then adding or rewiring links using probability p for every node in turns 
to make a low density of short path that connect the remote parts in the lattice. When p = 0, the 
graph is a regular lattice, whereas p = 1, it becomes almost a random graph [68]. The process is 
shown in fig 2.9: 
 
Fig 2.9 (a) an example of a regular lattice with L = 20, k =2. (b) an example of small-world network 
with three shortcuts. (c) an example of random derived from rewiring the (a) graph. 
(Source form Watts & Strogatz, 1998, ref. [88]) 
 
? Clustering coefficient value 
For a small-world network, many properties can be calculated in mathematical way easily. First of 
all, we express the clustering coefficient value for it. Barrat and Weight [6] proposed that: 
 
? =
3(??1)
2(2??1)
(1 ?  )3  (2.8) 
 
? Degree distribution 
Next main aspect is degree distribution. Even though it is not good to represent the real-world 
networks? feature, not the same goal as scale-free network, we should compute this parameter when 
describing the network model. The equation provided below: 
(a) regular lattice            (b) small-world              (c) random

0 j < k 
 
? Average path length 
Finally we mention the average path length, which is another significant property for small-world 
network except high clustering. We use ? to denote this parameter. Newman and his group give the 
final solution of ? [67]: 
 
? =  
 
2?√1+2 / 
    ?1
1
√1+2 / 
  (2.10) 
 
where  = 1/(  ). 
2.1.5.3 scale-free network 
Another typical artificial model is called scale-free network. Following the definition of scale-free 
network whose degree distribution follows a power law, it is a network contains some nodes that 
have a tremendous number of connections, whereas most nods have only few [7].  
 
Mathematically, we use Pk to donate the fraction of nodes in the network having k connections to 
other nodes, then, the distribution follows: 
 ? = ? 
??  (2.11) 
 
Usually, c is constant and  ? ≈ (? ? 1)???1 , and m stands for the lower boundary for the 
connectivity of a node [18]. In addition, some evidences derived from percolation study in 
scale-free network proved that the parameter ? is typically in the range 2 < ? < 3 [18]. 
 
From now on, the scale-free property have been found in a lot of real networks, including the world 
wide web [2], metabolic networks [41], transport system, and some social network responsible for 
spread of disease [25]. Two simple examples compare the random and scale-free networks 
described in the following to show this model in concise way. The fig2.10 shows their structure 
with random network on left and scale-free one on right includes hubs (red nodes) with huge 
number of links. Correspondingly, their degree distribution is expressed in fig2.11.

2.1.5.4 Network with community structure: LFR algorithm 
Until now, we have constructed some basic network which is usually used in graph and network 
properties analysis. To do the research with other science areas like biology or sociology, more 
realistic network needs to be simulated. In this part, we will introduce an algorithm that can 
construct undirected and unweighted graph with nodes assigned into communities, which is 
called Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark, denote as LFR.  
 
The LFR benchmark is a planted partition model, where the nodes degrees and groups? size 
follow a power law with exponent t1 and t2, respectively [42]. To realize one LFR benchmark, 
every input parameter should be mentioned first:

decreases.

A realization LFR network, with 1000 nodes and other parameters k = 6, maxk = 15,mu = 0.1, 
minc = 20, maxc = 50, corresponding to the network shown in Fig 2.12. 
 
 
Fig 2.12 network generate by LFR algorithm, with parameter: N=1000,k = 6, maxk = 15,mu = 0.1, 
minc = 20, maxc = 50. 
 
To launch the process of LFR benchmark includes the following steps [44]: 
1. Firstly, all of nodes will be assigned one membership, which according to, in general, 
power-law distribution. Then, N degrees {ki} built up with power-law distribution with 
exponent t1 will be random allocate to N nodes 
2. Next, for each node, a fraction 1 ? ? of its edges will connect within the same community 
nodes and a fraction ? edges will link to other nodes of the whole network, where ? is the 
mixing parameter listed in table 2.

3. Then, assign the communities size {  } by building random numbers from another 
power-law distribution with exponent t2. Obviously, the sum of the node memberships 
equals the sum of the community sizes ∑  ? = ∑    ? . Then, every node should choose a 
community belonging within the limitation:   ? =    *  +    and   ? =    * ?+  
 ?, where N is the total nodes in network and  ? is the number of communities. We use Fig 
2.13 to illustrate this process: 
 
Fig 2.13 process of the bipartite network for allocate nodes to their communities [47] 
 
This picture shows a bipartite network that has two groups: one is N nodes (top) and another is nc 
communities (bottom). Each community has    edges, meanwhile each node has as many links 
as its own memberships  ?. Then, iterate the rewiring process for the bipartite network until the 
constriction ∑    ?? ≥  ?
(??),       is satisfied. 
4. Next, each community will be generated one by one. Every communities have degree set 
{ ?( )}, which can construct by the configuration model [63]. 
5. Finally, we will build the links between different communities with degree sequence { ?
(   )+, 
where  ?
(   ) =  ? ?.  
 
The LFR benchmark is based on Girvan and Newman (GN) benchmark and adds more complex 
properties of network with only linear computation time [46]. To know more detail about the

2.1.6 Network evolution 
After experiencing some typical static network structure, we should consider a more complicated 
situation: community evolution and dynamic. Even though the analysis of community evolution is 
still in the infancy stage, many scientists have already recognized its importance. Usually the 
network structures are relatively fixed in time, but they are inherently changeable [17]. Because the 
edges within the network can be cut, created and rewired and the nodes can update their states [17].  
 
Moreover, to consider a more complicated structure, a multi-mode network that composed by 
multiple heterogeneous social actors [82], co-affecting and changing ability of the network is 
expressed more significantly. Therefore, the community evolution should be accounted for as an 
important factor when analysing some specific network, such as co-disease spreading between 
multi-actors, cluster of frequently interacting authors in the blogosphere [49], and mobile 
subscriber network [90].  
 
From Fortunato?s viewpoint [34], the events which happen in the lifetime for communities are birth, 
growth, contraction, merger, split and death, which showed in fig 2.14. In other words, all these 
events can affect the evolution process of a community. 
 
Fig 2.14 Possible change for community evolution.  
 (source from Palla et al., 2007, ref.  [70]) 
 
To simulate the evolution process is to implement these events on a constructed network. Some 
simple way like cutting the links between nodes, membership switching has been attempted by 
scientists. For instance, Duan and his team created random weighted directed graphs with 
embedded community structure. Then change the community structure within four different time 
stages [24]. Furthermore, Tang described an approach for generating a multi-mode network. He 
created a set of latent communities as the basic network, and then randomly changed a proportion 
of community memberships at each stage.

2.2 Epidemic model 
2.2.1 Introduction 
In terms of epidemiology, the traditional way of studying disease spreading is based on Newtonian 
physics [91], which means that when we consider the effects of the disease only in a 
straightforward way, that is, all the connection or interactions are either regarded as second-order 
processes [91] or are ignored. Furthermore, in the past, the epidemiology study is on the population 
(whole or global) level [72], which has a big limitation to express the process of disease spread. 
More recently, a new viewpoint that considers the infectious disease process in nonlinear way [73] 
point out that the traditional thinking of disease spread processes is seen as insufficient. By contrast, 
the modern epidemiology is based on the individual level to simulate the disease process. To be 
explicit, in a complex system, everything or every individual is variant or changeable which can be 
marked by different states. Furthermore, points or individuals in a system are interdependent and 
affect each other which cannot be interpreted by static and linear models [75]. Nowadays, in order 
to illustrate the mechanisms of infectious disease spread, some nonlinear mathematical modeling is 
proposed, which allows us to describe the complex disease spread process and the inter-effects 
between individuals and, moreover, they have been proved as very useful tools to investigate the 
way diseases outbreak and spread to predict the future course in order to control an epidemic. 
2.2.2 Types of epidemic models 
2.2.2.1 Deterministic compartmental Epidemic Models 
A deterministic compartmental model (DCM) can be defined as a model composed by individuals, 
which are classified into different compartments (states) depending on the specific disease which 
are under study [85]. Furthermore, the deterministic model is often expressed as differential 
equations; this is because the individuals whose change rate from one compartment to another are 
denoted as derivatives. And a solution of the DCM is a function of time, and, moreover, is generally 
uniquely dependent on the initial data [51].  
 
To simulate a deterministic model, all the changes of compartments must be calculated using only 
the history data [13]. In other words, the process of disease spread must be deterministic. 
2.2.2.2 Stochastic Epidemic Models 
But the real life epidemic process has various random characters. Consequently, we create 
stochastic models which are used to calculate the probability of the final events [85]. The events 
include, for example, the probability distribution of final epidemic size, the probability distribution 
of the disease vanishing time, and the associated mean [85]. In other words, the probability 
distribution for these events is the solution of a stochastic model. 
Disease transmission in different structured network  
18 
Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
 
To make it clear, the aim of stochastic modeling is to describe a stochastic epidemic process. And a 
stochastic process is a collection of random variables: 
{Xt(s)|t?T,s?S}  (2.12) 
 
Where T stands for time, either discrete or continuous: 
T = {0, 1, 2, 3, } or T = [0,∞ )  (2.13) 
 
And S represents a sample space or the events mentioned before. 
 
The stochastic models, in contrast to the deterministic version, simulates the process using the idea 
of uncertain modeling. The study of stochastic epidemic models is based on probability theory [51]. 
Furthermore, stochastic models usually used to expose the inherent features of demographics or 
environment variability. 
2.2.3 Simple deterministic models 
Some deterministic models, proposed in 1927, by W. O. Kermack and A. G. Mckendeick [43], are 
well-known epidemic models which can illustrate the typical disease spreading process. According 
to the different properties of diseases that concern immunity or without that, models have different 
structure. The terminology SIR model is used to represent a disease which considers immunity 
against re-infection. Furthermore, the SIS is used to indicate a process that an individual is infected 
from the susceptible class to the infective class and then recover to the susceptible class again, 
which means this kind of disease cannot get immunity. Additionally, the SEIR and SEIS stand for 
the models which include an exposed period between susceptive state and infective state. They can 
be considered as variation versions of the basic SIR and SIS model. 
 
This part will introduce the simplest model: SIS and SIR without considering the birth and death 
and environment factors. And then, we will incorporate the demographic element into models. 
2.2.3.1 The SIS Epidemic Model 
In SIS epidemic models, all of the individuals are classified into two classes (according to the 
disease situations), susceptible or infectious, denoted by S and I, respectively. Normally, the SIS 
model is used for sexually transmitted diseases [85].  
 
The mechanism of simple SIS model: 
As showed in fig2.15, at initial time, all the individuals are marked in a state or classified in a class 
randomly, either S or I state. If a susceptible individual has an infectious neighbor, it has   
probabilities to be infected. Then after a successful infection process, it turns into infectious state, 
but does not have any immunity to the disease. Therefore, after the time of recovery, the infectious 
individuals return to a susceptible state. As shown in the picture, the infected individuals have 
Disease transmission in different structured network  
19

  rate to recover into susceptive class per unit time. 
 
Fig2.15 mechanism of compartmental SIS model 
(source from Fred Brauer, 2000, ref. [14]) 
 
The mechanism of SIS model with births and deaths: 
Taking the demography factors into account, we get the SIS with births and deaths model as below. 
The diagram 2.16 shows its mechanism. Solid arrows stand for infection or recovery while dotted 
arrows stand for births and deaths. 
 
Fig2.16 mechanism of compartmental SIS model with births and deaths 
(source from Linda J. S. Allen, 2000, ref. [50]) 
 
Additionally, depending on the mechanism of this model, we will get the differential equations for 
SIS model with a pre-assumption that S(t)+ I(t) =N is the total population size. 
? 
? 
= ?     (   )  
? 
? 
=    ? (   )      
 
The new symbol   stands for the average death rate. And in this model, we assume that the birth 
rate equals to the death rate to illustrate it in a simple way, hence, dN/dt = 0.  
Furthermore, the solution of this model is also determined by the breakout threshold called R0. Let 
S(t) and I(t) be a solution to this model, then: 
 
? If R0 < 1, then    ? ?+∞( ( ),  ( )) = ( , 0) , the infection dies out, (disease free 
equilibrium). 
? If R0 > 1, then   ? ?+∞( ( ),  ( )) = (
 
  
,  (1 ?

)), there is an epidemic. (endemic 
equilibrium).

? Epidemic break out threshold R0 
In epidemiology, R0 is called the basic reproduction number. It is a number of an epidemiological 
meaning that how many people will be secondary infected by a single infective individual enter into 
a wholly susceptible population [14]. 
 
theorem1: the 
  (0)
 
 is a threshold in this case, denoted by R0.  
If R0 < 1, the infection dies out, while if R0 > 1 there is an epidemic. 
 
Proof: 
To begin, we know the S(t) and I(t) should be non-negative. Hence, either S(t) or I(t) reaches to 
zero the process is consider be terminated. As be experimented by [14], the number of infective 
people increases as long as    /  ; but since the susceptive number  decreases through the 
whole period, I will decrease finally and approach to zero. To sum up, if  (0) <  /  or R0 < 1, I 
decreases to zero which means there is no epidemic, while if  (0)   /  or R0 >1, I first 
increase to a maximum level and then decrease to zero, which stands for epidemic. 
2.2.3.2 The SIR Epidemic Model 
In a simple way, the SIR model can be derived from the SIS model by adding R class with 
considering the infected people after recovers will have the immunity against the disease. Hence, 
the SIR model have three compartmental that Susceptible - Infected – Recovered and also can be 
described as Susceptible - Infected – Removed. In the second situation, we allow the people in the 
population die from it [32]. In another words, the whole population size is changeable. Examples of 
diseases suitable for the first class include influenza and chicken pox. The famous diseases like 
HIV or the Bubonic Plague that lead most people die from contracting it belong to the second 
category. 
 
The mechanism of SIR model: 
To keep things simple, we consider the SIR model without births and deaths situation. In the SIR 
epidemic model, we classify all the population in to three classes, labeled S, I, and R, which 
represent susceptive, infective and recovered, respectively. Moreover, let S(t), I(t), and R(t) denote 
the number of individuals who are in the state S, I, and R in the time t. At initial time, all the 
individuals are classified in a class, S or I, randomly. If a susceptible individual has an infectious 
neighbor, it has   probabilities to be infected. Then after a successful infection process, turn into 
infectious state; every individual in the infectious class has   probabilities to recover, which 
depends on the specific disease usually. Then, after recover from infected state, the individual turn 
into recovered class, which means that it has the immunity to the disease and will not be infected 
again. The flow of this model is shown in Fig 2.17. 
Disease transmission in different structured network  
21 
Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
 
Fig 2.17 flow chart for the SIR model 
(source from Fred Brauer, 2000, ref. [14]) 
 
Same as SIS model, fixed the population size, N=S(t)+I(t)+R(t), then the model can be described in 
the following differential equations: 
 
       
? 
? 
= ?                         
? 
? 
=    ?         (2.14) 
         
? 
? 
=                                       
 
Additionally, this model is based on four assumptions: 
1) Every individual in the population has an equal probability to contact the disease with rate  , 
which is called the disease infection rate. Hence, an infected individual is able to transmit the 
disease with    people per unit time. 
 
2) The infectious individual has the   probability to leave this class,   is usually depends on 
the specific disease that under study. 
 
3) For the second and third equations, we assume that all the individuals leaving from the 
susceptible class will turn into the infected class. And the number of leaving from the 
susceptible class is equal to the number of entering into the removed class per unit time. 
 
4) The population size is considered as fixed. 
 
Looking at the assumption (2), we need give it a full mathematical explanation to make it more 
reasonable for epidemiological meaning. We use C(s) stand for the number of the individuals who 
are in the infectious class for s time units continually. If a rate   to leave from the infectious class 
per unit time, then: 
? 
? 
= ? ?   (2.15) 
 
 
 
S I R 
? ? 
Disease transmission in different structured network  
22 
Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
Hence, the solution of this differential equation is: 
 
?( ) = ?(0)?? s   (2.16) 
 
which shows that the portion of the infected individuals remaining in the infectious class for s time 
units is ??  . Therefore, we can explain the assumption (2) in a way with epidemiological meaning 
that the length of the disease infective period is accord to an exponential distribution with mean 
∫ ??  ? =  
1
 
∞
0
 .  
For the assumption (4), it can be also explain as that the rate of infection and recovery process is 
significant faster than the birth and deaths time scale, which allow us to ignored the demography 
factors.  
 
The mechanism of SIR model with births and deaths: 
The previous subsection describes the basic SIR model which considers the simplest situation. In 
that model, we have dropped births and deaths factors to maintain the population size stable. But 
for diseases that are prevalent in some region or in term of endemic must be considered in another 
way. Some reasons: firstly, with small size of the total population, the effects of vaccine or 
quarantine is significant to weaken the epidemic [14]; in addition, a flow of new infected or 
susceptible individuals enter into the population need to be think about [14]. Finally, a larger 
proportion (when considering that the whole population size is small) of people will be dead from 
the disease, which should allow the death be taken into account. 
 
The main process is as same as the simple SIR model, only incorporate the shift or enter and 
departure path for births or deaths. The diagram 2.18 shows its mechanism. Solid arrows stand for 
infection or recovery while dotted arrows stand for births and deaths.

Using the differential equations to describe its mechanical with assumption that the total population 
size N=S(t)+I(t)+R(t):

Similar with SIS model, we only add the third equation to the previous solutions. 
In this case,  0 =
 
 + 
 , where1/(   ) stands for the length of the infectious period [14]. 
According to theorem1, the solutions to these differential equations are: 
 
? If R0 < 1, then   ? ?+∞( ( ),  ( ),  ( )) = ( , 0,0), the infection dies out, this point is 
defined as disease free equilibrium. 
? If R0 > 1, then   ? ?+∞( ( ),  ( ),  ( )) = (
 
  
,
  
 + 
(1 ?
1
  
),
  
 + 
(1 ?

)), there is an 
epidemic. This point is called endemic equilibrium. 
 
Additionally, we give out second theorem here: 
 
Theorem 2: Assume  = 0  if  0
 (0)
 
 1,  the number of individuals in infected class will 
increase (epidemic). On the other hand, if  0
 (0)
 
 1,  the infective number decrease 
monotonically (no epidemic). 
 
Here we define the R0S(0)/N as the initial replacement number. It gives the meaning of the 
average number of secondary infections produced by an infected individual at the start of the 
epidemic [36, 37]. As we can see from the theorem 2, if the replacement number is smaller than 
one, the epidemic will vanish ultimately. By contrast, if the data is bigger than one, the population 
will suffer an epidemic outbreak. 
2.2.4 Stochastic epidemic models 
From now on, we have described the most famous deterministic compartment models (SIR and 
SIS). But in some situations, the deterministic model is not sufficient. There are some reasons why 
the stochastic idea has been proposed. Firstly, for example, real epidemics in our life can either end 
up because of a limited number of individuals are infected, or go extinct with a good isolation 
measures that making a large proportion of the population have been protected, which help to stop 
the disease a lot. It is only stochastic models that can express this kind of characters and the 
probability of each event taking place [16]. Additionally, stochastic models are often used when 
we want to show the inherent features of the demographics or environment variability, especially 
Disease transmission in different structured network  
24 
Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
when the population size or initial number of infective individuals is very small [51]. Finally, 
Demiris points out that stochastic model are more intuitively logical to define, because that they 
instinctively describe the contact processes between individuals [19]. 
 
The previous subsection has introduced some simple deterministic models. The aim of this part will 
provide the stochastic version that directly relate to their deterministic counterparts. There are 
many techniques for construct the stochastic, such as discrete time Markov chain (DTMC), 
continuous time Markov chain (CTMC), and stochastic differential equation (SDE). To be simple, 
we will only derive stochastic SIR and SIS using the first method. 
2.2.4.1 Assumption and Terminology for stochastic model 
The stochastic model will be described in the following part:  
 
Assumptiong1: the total population size N is constant. To make it simple, we decide the birth rate 
equals to the death rate. 
 
Assumptiong2: same as the deterministic model, S(t) + I(t) + R(t) =N. In other words, all the 
individuals should be classified in the three groups (remove R class in SIS model). 
Then, we give some notations: 
 
? S(t), I(t), R(t) represent discrete random variables for the number of susceptive, infected, and 
recovered individuals at time t, respectively, where t ? {0, ∆t, 2∆t, }: 
S(t), I(t), R(t)? {0,1,2,,N}  (2.18) 
 
?  : contact rate;  : recover rate;  : average death rate. 
? Pi(t) stands for the probability of the infected number equals i at time t: 
Pi(t) = Prob{I(t) = i}   (2.19) 
 
Therefore, i = 0, 1, 2,.N, and ∑  ?( ) = 1
 
?=0  
2.2.4.2 SIS model 
In a DTMC SIS model, because of the constant total population size, using the assumption 2 that S(t) 
= N – I (t), we can consider there is only one independent variable, I(t). Then the question change to 
that we should express the stochastic process of I(t) from t = 0 to t= ∞. 
 
First, we make one more assumption: the changing process of infected number I(t) has the Markov 
property. Therefore the number at time t+∆t only depends on one previous time step t: 
 
Prob{I(t+∆t)| I(t), I(t-∆t),. I(0)} = Prob{I(t+∆t)| I(t)}  (2.20) 
 
Disease transmission in different structured network  
25 
Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
Then, in order to complete the model, we provide Pji(t+∆t, t) to stand for the probability of the 
number of infected individuals which is j at time t+∆t with a precondition that the infected number 
is i at time t: 
Pji(t+∆t, t) = Prob{I(t+∆t) = j| I(t)=i}   (2.21) 
 
Next, to let the model be described, we decrease the time step ∆t  to small enough so that changes 
of the number of infected individuals is at most one during ∆t:  j = i+1 or j = i-1 or j = i. 
 
From now on, we can illustrate the stochastic SIS epidemic model in fig 2.19: 
 
Fig 2.19 stochastic SIS epidemic model. 
(source from Linda J. S. Allen, 2000, ref. [50]) 
 
As we can see from the fig 2.19, the change of infected number, * ( )+ =0
∞ , can be described as a 
Markov process. Some features of this model can be easily explained by Markov chain theory [4, 
83]. This picture says the final state must be 0, which means, in DTMC SIS model, the result will 
reach to disease-free equilibrium, except when the basic reproduction number is significant large 
[50]. But depends on the parameter and initial conditions, the duration of the epidemic can be very 
long. In another words, the convergence rate of the disease-free equilibrium can be very low. 
 
Now, we give the mathematically description for stochastic SIS model. The transition probabilities 
between states satisfy: 
    
 ?( ??)
 
   ,                 j = i+1 
Pji(∆t) =   (   )    ,                j = i-1 
          1-,
 ?( ??)
 
 (   ) -    ,   j = i 
                               0                         j ≠ i+1,I,i-1 
      
To make it simple, we substitute 
 ?( ??)
 
 as b(i), which stands for the transition probability for a 
new infection. While substitute (?   )  as d(i), which means a death or a recovery [50]. Then, let 
p(t) =(p0(t), p1(t), , pN(t))
T
 represents the probability vector for I(t). Moreover, we use a matrix to 
explain the transition probability: 
0 1 2 N 
P21(t+∆t, t) 
. 
P12(t+∆t, t) 
PN,N-1(t+∆t, t)

Now, the DTMC SIS model is completely constructed. Therefore, we can simulate the change 
process of I(t) through the epidemic time. At any time t ?[0,∞), we get: 
 
p(t+∆t) = P(∆t) p(t) = Pn+1(∆t) p(0)  (2.23) 
 
Then, we should only obtain an initial probability vector p(0). 
2.2.4.3 SIR model 
Similar with SIS model, in DTMC SIR model, we consider two random variables {S(t), I(t)} [82]. 
Then, our aim is to trace the change of S and I number in the Markov process. 
 
Let p(s,i)(t) = Prob{S(t)=s, I(t)=i}, where s, i = 0,1,2,.N. Next, we define the transition probability 
under an assumption that ∆t is small enough that at most one change will happened during time step 
t:  
p(s+k,i+j),(s,i)( ∆t) = Prob{(∆S, ∆I) = (k, j)|(S(t), I(t)) = (s, i)} = 
  ( ?  )  / ,                    (k, j) = (?1, 1) 
    ,                               (k, j) = (0, ?1) 
    ,                               (k, j) = (1, ?1)

0,                                 otherwise  
 
Then, same with SIS model, giving the initial situation p(0), we can calculate the whole path of the 
change of infected and recovered numbers. 
2.3 Chapter summary

Disease transmission in different structured network  
27 
Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
In the theory of network part, we described four main properties of a social network that was 
studied widely and affected the structure of the network dramatically. In addition, these properties 
can be changed as input parameters in order to change the network structure. Then, we showed 
various real social networks, especially focus on the different types of community structure. Next, 
four network generation algorithm were proposed: random graph generation, small-world 
network, scale-free network and network with community structure. These algorithms are some of 
the main flow of artificial network generation methods. Finally, to give one more step to the 
research, the concepts of dynamic and evolution of community structure in network were proposed, 
which open a new area for network study. 
 
Next, we use one section to illustrate the knowledge system of epidemic model. Two different ways 
for constructing the model: deterministic and stochastic methods. The deterministic method is the 
basic theory for epidemic science, whilst stochastic concept can be used to simulate the real 
situation of epidemic process. In addition, for network based epidemic processing, stochastic 
concept will be adopted. Next, we describe SIR and SIS model in these two ways that depending 
on wither the disease have or have no immunity state, respectively. Additionally, we can add some 
classes or states when it is necessary for describing some specific diseases. For example, for 
diseases like HIV, we can add a class called “exposed” which stands for a latent period. This model 
is called SEIR model. And also MSIR model, using for measles, adds a maternally-derived 
immunity class for babies are not born into the susceptible class but has immunity to the disease for 
the first few months. Hence, these two models are the basic version of other derived epidemic 
model.

3. Previous work on effects of network structure to epidemic process 
Based on the background knowledge of network and epidemic model, this chapter will collect 
and summarize some previous work in this area, which can help us to clear our question and 
object. In addition, we can learn from their work and improve some part to design our 
experiment. 
 
Until now, a lot of studies about the effects of network structure to infectious disease spreading 
have been launched, which combine and use the two parts knowledge in background section. 
Most of them focus on how some properties of network, like degree distribution and clustering 
coefficient, impact parameters of an epidemic (eg. the basic reproductive ratio R0, the size of the 
epidemic and so on). Meanwhile, some researchers find out that the community structure is a 
main factor to affect disease spreading process.  
 
? Methods used  
A typical simulation for disease spreading based on network consists of the following sequence: 
network generation, a disease model with specific limitation (eg. Recover rate, infection rate) 
running on the network. During one iteration, individuals? states will change between totally 
assumed situations. Moreover, births and deaths may occur.  
 
Among these researches, different ways of network generation are mentioned. In paper [15], the 
epidemics process was launched on a random graph with tunable clustering. More complex, in 
Mills work of TB and HIV analysis [59], they use a method described by Read and Keeling in 
[47], which is characterized by a locality parameter D. In addition, the network with 
homogeneous nodes and network with heterogeneous nodes appear in [57]. 
 
? Result and achievement from now on in this area 
From different experiments, some result got. In paper [83], Miller point out that clustering is a 
dominant element controlling the epidemic growth rate. In addition, he mentioned that the effects 
of heterogeneity and edge weights to disease spreading are minimal when the network structure 
strongly clustered. Furthermore, similar work did in [2], Salathe et al. simulated the process of 
disease spreading on network with strongly community structure, and they conclude that 
community structure has a major impact on epidemic process. Additionally, they found that 
immunization interventions for individuals bridging communities are better than simply using for 
highly connected individuals. Moreover, Britton and his group use empirical and investigate the 
variation of epidemic threshold and probability of a large outbreak with the clustering in the 
network and find that as the clustering increases, the epidemic decreases [15]. More researches 
have been done in [26, 62, 80]

4. Methods 
To launch the experiments, in the same way as the previous work, two main parts include: social 
network generation and epidemic dynamic model simulation. In this part, firstly, we will make 
our question through reification. Then, detail methods will be proposed. 
4.1 Questions 
Based on the background knowledge of network and epidemic model, using the previous work as 
reference, this chapter will answer the question of how the network structure affects the epidemic 
process, especially the community structure?s effects. In more detail, this question is divided into 
five sub-questions below. Moreover, to define the objects more clearly, they are also illustrated in 
fig 4.1: 
1. How does the average degree (the most basic property of the network) affect the epidemic 
growth rate, epidemic duration time and epidemic final size? 
2. How does the community strength (the new popular topic appears recently) affect the 
epidemic growth rate, the duration time and its final size? 
3. How does the overlap rate in the network with overlapped community (new area which 
focuses on deep community structure) affect the epidemic growth rate, the duration time of 
the epidemic and the final size of the epidemic? 
4. The effects of the population flow rate (refer to the dynamic network or network evolution) 
to the epidemic growth rate, the duration time and the final size of the epidemic. 
5. Different community structure?s effect (different community structure with the same 
generation parameter) to epidemic growth rate, epidemic duration time and its final size.

4.2 Experiment design summary 
To solve these questions, as shown in table 4.1, the whole process of the experiment is presented 
below. The table should read from right to left as an equation. Firstly, we should fix the disease 
parameter: infection rate and disease durations
 [1]
, which are used in the epidemic dynamic model.  
 
[1] disease durations: the value depends on disease property and varies a little in different 
individuals. Mathematically, durations ? = 1/  , where   is the recovery rate.

Then, two main groups of experiments are conducted. The first one focuses on the effects of the 
properties of the network, including average degree, community strength, community overlap rate 
and probability of individuals? movement, which aims to solve the first four questions. Another?s 
aim is to find how the different community structure of a network can affect the epidemic process. 
Finally, the aim is to calculate the value of growth rate, durations and final size of the epidemic. In 
addition, in all of these networks, both the network with and without weighted edges were tested. 
 
Table 4.1 experiments structure 
 
4.3 Infection disease data choose 
After analysis revealing information about some infectious disease, a new parameter D is used to 
classify them. Where 
? =    e         e ?             e .  (4.1) 
When D tends to 0, it means an individual will recover more easily, and vice versa. In our 
experiments, we choose two typical values of D for express real disease. One is D equals 0.9 that 
close to 1, where infection rate equals 0.3 and duration days equals 3 (influenza, ref [80]), and 
another is D equals 0.1 that tend to 0, where infection rate equals 0.01 and the duration in days 
equals 10. 
4.4 Network generation description 
4.4.1 Experiment one 
In the first group of experiments, four independent experiments are included, which will check 
the effects of the average degree, community strength, and population flow rate and overlap rate, 
respectively. For each one, one parameter as variable is considered, which is called the testing 
value. All the other valuables were fixed. Then, during each experiment, we gave each fixed value 
six values and arranged them into six groups. Additionally, all the networks constructed in this 
part are using the method described by Fortunato in [44]. 
 
For every generated network, we have a series of statistics value used to evaluate it. To be exact, 
Disease transmission in different structured network

their modularity, using the algorithm proposed by Blondel etc in [9], average Clustering Coefficient, 
the algorithm mentioned in [48], and average path described in [12] are calculated. 
4.4.1.1 Average Degree as testing value 
In these experiments, we generated six groups of networks with different fixed corresponding 
parameters list below, in table 4.2:

6 0.9 0 500/1000 10/20 50/100 
 
As shown in the table, all the networks here have 500 or 1,000 individuals with different 
community strength range from 0 to 0.9. Moreover, one thing should be emphasized that all the 
networks generated here are without overlapped community structure, which is another testing 
variable, and will be tested in other experiments. In terms of the testing value: average degree will 
be examined from 5 to 30 for each testing group. In total, 30 networks are constructed here. The fig 
4.2- fig 4.6 illustrates the examples of the networks and their main statistic properties:

As shown in fig 4.2 a), it has an average degree 5 with a power-law degree distribution. And the 
colour bar represents the degree of each node. The network has strong community structure with 
the mixing parameter setting as 0.1. In addition, its average path length is 5.028, which is longer 
than the network in 4.2 b) whose average path is 3.098 with average degree 20. Their detail

By contrast, the networks constructed in fig 4.5 have weak community structure, where the mixing 
parameter is 0.9 for both of the two. The network left has average degree 5 corresponding to 
network in fig4.2 a). Meanwhile, the network on the right has average degree 20, which has more 
density relationship between nodes.

color bar shows the degree for each node, b) network whose average degree equals 20, and all the other 
parameter same as network a). 
 
In addition, these two networks? detailed statistical information is listed in table 4.4 and fig 4.6- fig 
4.7. As we can see that the value of average clustering coefficient is much smaller than the network 
generated in fig 4.2, which has a very strong community strength. Hence, we can speculate that the 
community strength and clustering coefficient have positive correlations. In other words, if it is 
difficult to calculate the modularity of a network, which is often used to evaluate the strength of 
community structure, the clustering coefficient can be an auxiliary parameter to estimate 
community structure.

4.4.1.2 Community strength as testing value 
Same as section 4.4.1.1, we also generated six groups of networks with different fixed 
corresponding parameters in this section. But the community strength changed as the testing 
variable this time, the detail input parameter shown in table 4.5

6 30 0.1 500/1000 10/20 50/100 
 
To find out the correlation between community strength and some of epidemic parameters is not a 
very clear task. This is because until now there is no unified parameter to evaluate the community 
strength. In standard practice, scientist use modularity as the standard method when quantifing 
community structure in network. But for artificial network, like LFR benchmark, they use a value 
called mixing parameter to express the relations. First, we should give the exact definition of 
modularity, which is more widely used: 
 
Modularity is a benefit function used to decide a division of a network into modules or 
communities. Good divisions will get high scores and vice versa. The modularity is a similar 
conception of community that has internal connections of density and sparse connections between 
different modules [76].  
 
Next, we find out that mixing parameter has a power-law relation to the modularity and another 
auxiliary parameter clustering coefficient, which strengthens the viewpoint that when mixing value 
tends to 0, strong community or modularity exists in the network, whilst when the value tends to 1, 
the network will change to a random structure. The data of networks with average degree of 5 
provided in table 4.6 and fig.4.8 give evidence to this argument.

In fig 4.9 a), an example of the network with average degree of 10 and strong community 
strength.is drawn. Different communities are labeled by different colours. As shown in the picture, 
19 communities consist of the whole network. In addition, the corresponding modularity, average 
clustering coefficient and average path length are 0.837, 0.234 and 3.824, respectively. By contrast, 
fig 4.9 b) shows a network with less strength of community structure, with modularity of 0.737, 
average clustering coefficient of 0.165 and average path length of 3.469.

4.4.1.3 Overlap rate as testing value 
In this part, we generated network with overlapped communities using the parameter „-on? and 
„-om? in LFR algorithm to control the ratio of overlap. To be simple, all the overlapped nodes we 
assumed that they belong to at most two communities, where we set „-om? always equals 2. 
Furthermore, the value of „-on? which denote the overlapped people equals the total population 
multiply the overlap ratio. We tested the overlap rate from 0 to 1 to observe effects. As in previous 
experiments, all the other fixed parameters are classified into six groups listed in table 4.7:

Fig 4.10 gives three examples generated in this part of all the network, which here have strong 
community structure with mixing parameter of 0.1. From left to right, their overlap rates are 0.1, 
0.2 and 0.4 respectively. Among the experiments, the group 3 and 6 almost useless. This is because 
these two networks have very weak community structure. In addition, their statistical information

4.4.1.4 Probability of movements for individuals 
In this sub-group of experiments, dynamic network are generated. As same as previous 
experiments, we divide fixed variables into six groups, where the data list in table 4.9. To generate 
dynamic network, the first step is to build a static network based on given parameters. Second, for 
every evolution step, every individual have specific probability to move to another communities. In 
the experiments, we use two methods to simulate the network evolution process. The first is called 
random movement evolution and another is based on the common population flow phenomena 
during epidemic outbreak which includes community merging, contraction, splitting, birth and 
death.

? Random movement evolution 
To achieve network dynamic, we consider the whole evolution process as a Markov process
 [1]
. First 
of all, we give out some assumptions the experiments based on here: 
1. We only consider the movements between communities. In other words, the movements inside 
community will be thought has little effects to the disease spreading.  
2. In terms of individual, we assume that for each time step, they have same probability to move 
to every other community. Mathematically, we use P(??+1
? |??
? ) denotes the probability of

Next, for every time step and individual, he or she has probability p to move to another random

? Directional movement 
Different from random movement, the directional movement use different moving probability   
for different individuals. In this situation, we assume that the probability   for people in epidemic

 higher than the normal area without epidemic. In addition, if one overlapped 
community outbreak with an epidemic, the individuals in the overlapped area tend to move from 
the community without epidemic. To implement the community splitting, during every evolution 
step, for each individual who have two memberships A and B, and the place A have an epidemic, 
they delete the membership A with probability   , which simulate the disappear of overlapped 
communities. Fig 4.11 illustrates this process. Moreover, if both community A and B have an 
epidemic, the people tend to move to other communities that same as process in random 
movement.

4.4.2 Experiment two 
Until now, the experiments which have been done can answer the question from 1 to 4 in section 
4.1. To answer question 5, we will use another way for network generation. In this part, every 
testing group of networks have same main parameters, but with different network structure. These 
experiments here are focus on the effects of several different community structures: bridge 
community, overlapped community and hierarchical community. 
 
In this part, all the networks are established based on small-world network, which was widely 
proved in real social network. To analyze community structure?s impact, basically, we need propose 
a comparison network without community structure. Here, the most basic small-world network will 
be built up firstly. Next, the bridge communities, overlapped communities and hierarchical 
communities will be set up in turn. 
4.4.2.1 Parameters 
To implement the experiments, the main parameters for every group of networks should be same. 
Simply, the total population, average degree and rewiring rate were set as same number for four 
networks in one testing group. In total, we designed five groups of experiments with parameters list 
in table 4.10:

5 20 0.3 1000 
4.4.2.2 Small-world network generation 
To generate the small-world network, the method was described in section 2.1.5.2. In fig 4.13, we 
gives an example of small-work network with 1000 nodes, 6 initial neighborhoods and rewiring 
rate of 0.1 and the corresponding degree distribution. In addition, same as experiments in 
Experiment one, all the statistical information for every constructed network were recorded. In this 
case, the network in fig 4.13 has average path length of 6.207, average degree of 6 and average 
clustering coefficient of 0.44.

4.4.2.3 Bridge disjoint community structured network 
Bridge disjoint community structure was described in paper [8], which was considered as one of 
the most common social structure for disease transmission analysis. To construct the network, the 
following steps include: 
 
1. Equally allocate individuals into m communities. For every community, using parameter k 
(nearest k neighbors) and rewiring rate p to construct m small-world networks. 
2. For each node, it has probability p? to link to every node from other communities. In order to 
make the average degree unchanged, for building one new edge, we should cut an internal edge. 
To be more detail, firstly, from step one, we can calculate the internal average degree k
in 
for 
every community and the probability of the connection between every two nodes k/N, where N 
stands for the total population in this community. Then, we set    ’ =  ? ? ( / ) , ? 
representing the ratio of links presence between nodes from different communities and nodes 
from the same one. In our experiments, the ? always was set as 0.2, which make the entire 
network has strong community structure. 
 
Fig 4.14 gives an example of bridge disjoint network with 1000 nodes and 10 communities. Every 
community has small-world property with k setting to 6 and p equals 0.1 initially. Furthermore, its 
degree distribution and clustering coefficient distribution list in fig 4.15. Other statistic like average 
path length and average clustering coefficient is 5.601 and 0.391, respectively.

4.4.2.4 Overlapped community structured network 
Different from the method in experiment one, the overlapped communities construct here use a 
more simple way and consist of small-world networks. To be simple, we only build two 
communities with overlapped part. The following three steps describe the generation process: 
 
1. Equally allocate individuals into 2 communities, donated as O1 and O2. Then, randomly choose 
x percent individuals from each community to make up a new small group or community C. In 
our experiments, for a network with 1000 nodes, x was set as 5.  
2. For each community O1, O2 and C, we constructed as small-world network with 
parameters   1 =  2    ?, where  1,  2,  ? represent k nearest neighbors for O1, O2 and C, 
respectively. 
3. Build up connections between overlapped part C and original communities O1, O2. For every

probability to make up a link. To control the effects of average degree?s change minimal, for 
every new edges born, an old edge of node ni will be deleted. 
 
In fig 4.16, an overlapped community structured network was presented. It has 1000 individuals 
with 100 nodes in overlapped part. This kind of model can represent the situation of social activities 
at urban fringe. For example, the red part represents people in a city, while blue part represents rural 
populations. And the overlapped area can illustrate some trade or business between them. Its 
statistics are provided in fig 4.17. Additionally, its average path length is 5.501 and average 
clustering coefficient is 0.363

4.4.2.5 Hierarchical community structured network 
Finally, hierarchical community structured network will be construct. It can be considered as a 
specific instance of overlapped network, but with more requirements of the structure shape. In 
paper [20], Clauset, Moore and Newman proposed an algorithm for hierarchical community 
network generation. And the source code can be downloaded from 
http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/hierarchy/. 
 
In our experiments, we use another way for network generation. A network has 3 hierarchies 
include 10 basic communities will be as an example constructed here. The detail process 
summarized below: 
 
1. Assign all the individuals into 10 communities and calculate the size of every community. 
2. Group the 10 communities into second level community. In addition, we assume that every 
second level community has at least two basic communities. Then, we should calculate and 
record the size for each second level community. 
3. After give all the individuals their two memberships, basic membership and second level 
membership, we begin to construct the network. Firstly, small-world network is constructed 
within each basic community. Secondly, for every second level community, we use probability 
p =  ? ? (
?
?? ?? ?    ?? ?  ???
)  to build a link between every pair of nodes come from 
different basic communities. Where k is the nearest k neighbors during basic network 
generation and ? is the ratio of connection probability between every pair of vertices within 
basic community and within second level community. 
4. Finally, to connect every second level community, we give probability p? =  ?? ?   to build 
up edges between them. 
 
Fig 4.18 shows the hierarchical network has 10 basic communities and 3 second level communities. 
It is generated by setting k as 6, p equals 0.5 and p? equals 0.5 respectively. In terms of statistic 
information, its average path length is 5.314 and average clustering coefficient is 0.341

4.5 Data structure for network 
After arriving at a clear position on the experiments design, we need to use program language to 
implement these. The algorithm for network generation was introduced in the beginning of 4.4. In 
this subsection, the main data structure used will be described. 
 
? Adjacency matrix 
Simply, we use adjacency matrix to describe and store the information of network. In mathematics, 
for a finite graph G has n vertices, we use   ?   matrix with the value of position Vij = 1 to 
Disease transmission in different structured network  
46 
Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
represent there is an edge between vertices i and j, whilst Vij = 0 means no links between them. 
 
In the algorithm to generate networks is a process to construct an adjacency matrix and the finally 
information of the network would be stored by the matrix. Furthermore, the process of network 
evolution or changes is also expressed by matrix transformation. 
 
? Adjacency list 
To inquire the information from matrix is time consuming, hence, when simulated the epidemic 
process, we use adjacency list instead of adjacency matrix. Before this step, all the information will 
be translate from adjacency matrix to adjacency list.  
 
? Weights list 
For weighted network, we added one more data structure to save information of the edges? weight. 
It is an one-dimensional array has m length, where m is the number of total edges in graph G. In the 
experiments, we generate m random numbers range from 0 to 1 following a power-law distribution. 
These weights express how close the relationship is between the two connected nodes i and j, which 
is in order to affect the probability of infection events. 
 
? State list 
State list is an array storing the information of each node in network for every step. Hence, it will 
change with every time step to record the state. Moreover, we used state matrix to be an 
accumulative way for recording the history of the changing process. To be exact for every new time 
step, the state matrix will add one more line to save the content of state list. In other words, the state 
matrix is a history document for entire event process; meanwhile state list is a note for the current 
time. 
4.6 Disease transmission 
Based on daily contact network, the disease transmission will happen. During the transmission, 
each individual is in one of two states and one of three states for SIS and SIR model respectively. 
Finally, all the result data include epidemic growing rate, final size and epidemic duration days, we 
collected from simulation of SIR model. At each (daily) time step the state transform for each 
individual is determined stochastically, based on the infection rate of specific disease and relevant 
recovery rates. 
 
As mentioned before, all the transmission processes were implemented on both un-weighted and 
weighted network, which will affect the probability of infection for one individual. Firstly, we 
assumed that the infection rate for each contact one day is   . In other words, it also means that the 
probability of not be infected after one contact is  1 ?  . In terms of un-weighted network, if one 
individual has k connections with other infection people, the probability of not be infected 
is ( 1 ?  )?. In contrast, it has 1 ?  ( 1 ?  )? possibility to turn to infected state. In weighted 
network, the infection rate equals    , where W is a vector of weights  W = *?1?2??+. Then, 
Disease transmission in different structured network  
47 
Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
the probability of be infected is 1 ? ∏ (1 ?  ??)? . 
 
In fig 4.20, one process of epidemic on dynamic network will be shown as an example. The 
network has 500 individuals in total and 17 communities. In the initial time step, the disease breaks 
out in two communities. Then, the transmission process runs with infection rate of 0.02 and 
duration days of 10.

5. Results and analysis 
This chapter describes details of the results obtained from experiments introduced in previous 
chapters. To express the questions and answers more clearly, we use the right side values in fig 
4.1: epidemic growth rate, epidemic duration time and its final size as the clue for this chapter. 
Additionally, we will analyze how the five input variables affect them. In order to remove the bias 
of a one time running result, every result is the average value of 500 implementations. Finally, we 
should mention that every group of experiments have been done with disease parameter D=0.1 
and D=0.9. They present same trend influence but with different strength. Here we choose the 
relative evident results to illustrate.  
5.1 Epidemic growing rate analysis 
In the experiments, we tested five factors to find out whether they can affect the epidemic growth 
rate and how they implement these effects. We find that (for given degree distribution), the 
average degree, community strength and population flow rate have clear correlations to the 
epidemic growth rate. Furthermore, under the same community strength, the overlap rate of 
communities has positive correlation to the growth rate. By contrast, different community 
structure with similar setting parameter has a limited impact. Edge weights that measure 
closeness have impact only when there are correlations between different edges.

Due to the huge number of experiments conducted, it is observed that the average degree of the 
network can significantly affect the epidemic growth rate. As shown in fig 5.1, under different 
groups of fixed variables, it can be seen that all of these express the same trend of effects. A 
bigger average degree corresponds to a higher growth rate and a smaller value refers to a lower 
growth rate. Take fig 5.1 b) for instance, the bigger average degree which leads to a bigger 
amplitude, which result in slower convergence speed than smaller one. Meanwhile, these results 
also illustrate that disease didn?t spread through the entire network under smaller average degree. 
In addition, comparing fig a) to f), it can be seen that the effects of average degree are stronger in 
a weak community structured network than the effects in network with a strong community 
structure. 
5.1.2 Community strength (measured by mixing rate in LFR algorithm) 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fig 5.2 effects of community strength to growing rate (D=0.1) 
 
Similar to the effects of average degree, the community strength is another main factor to affect 
epidemic growth rate, but in contrast, it has a negative correlation to growth rate. As it can be 
seen from fig 5.2, a bigger mixing value results in a higher growth rate. This means the 
community structure will restrict the disease spreading process. Take fig c) for example, these 
networks have 1000 population with an average of 20. The purple line increases quickly at the

     flowing rate =0 .1                     flowing rate =0.1                        flowing rate =0.1

beginning whilst the green line has a downward trend for the same period. In addition, we can see 
that the epidemic illustrated by the green and blue line didn?t break out. They have been limited 
within the community and the number of infectious individuals continues to decrease throughout 
the whole period. By contrast, the epidemic process represented by purple, light blue and red line 
experienced from outbreak to disappear. Moreover, there is a comparison between the first three 
pictures. It shows that community strength has little effect to a sparse network as generated in fig 
a). Meanwhile, comparing the figures in first row with that in second row, we find that the 
moving events will decrease the effects of community structure. 
5.1.3 Overlap rate under given community strength 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fig 5.3 effects of overlap rate to growing rate (D=0.1) 
 
In terms of overlap rate, we only test the simplest situation that the overlapped nodes at most have 
two memberships. Observed from fig 5.3, the overlap structure will help disease spread, which is 
illustrated clearly by fig b), d) and e). But its effect is not as dramatic as the first two factors: 
average degree and community strength. In fig a), a small average degree network is illustrated, 
all the lines conveying the same trend. This means under this kind of situation, even though 
community strength is strong, the overlap strength has no effects on the growth rate. Furthermore, 
a) N = 1000, avg. Degree = 5             b) N = 1000, avg. Degree = 10          c) N = 1000, avg. Degree =15

Disease transmission in different structured network

its effect will also be lost when the community strength becomes weaker, which is presented in c) 
and f). In addition, compared with picture b) and e), we can the effect of overlap rate to epidemic 
growth rate which will depend on average degree. In other words, the variable overlap rate is an 
assistant parameter which affects the growth rate. 
5.1.4 Population flow rate 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fig 5.4 effects of population flowing rate to growing rate (D=0.9) 
 
We tested probability of movement of individuals from 0 to 0.9 under different network situations: 
a strong community structured and a relatively weak one. The results are shown in fig 5.4, where 
we can see that this input parameter has positive correlation to the growth rate obviously in a) and 
b). Taking picture a) for example, under a strong community structured network with relative low 
density relations, the moving events can increase the epidemic growing speed more than three 
times of static network. But along with the average degree increase or the community structure 
becoming weaker, the effects of population flow rate will almost certainly rapidly decrease.

Fig 5.5 effects of different community structure to growing rate 
 
From the results illustrated in fig 5.5, it can be seen that the network that has a stronger 
community structure which will control the speed of disease spread. In the left picture, the 
epidemic didn?t break out whilst there was an epidemic process experienced on each network in 
the right picture. As we can see from the right one, one more piece of evidence proved that the 
overlapped structure positively affects the epidemic growth rate, which is described by the red 
line which has a more precipitous shape compared to the green line. In addition, the most 
significant result in this experiment is that the hierarchical structured network will dramatically 
constrict the disease spread. The big gap between the light blue line and other colored lines 
illustrates the phenomenon which reveals that the disease will be trapped in the dense part of the 
network, which decreases the opportunity for the disease to escape out. 
5.2 Epidemic duration days and final size analysis 
Next, we are going to analyse the value of the epidemic duration time and its final size. In terms 
of the duration, it is possible to calculate this by considering the day from epidemic break out to the 
day of no infected individuals existing in the monitored network. Same as epidemic growth rate, it 
is a result of a combination of all of the input parameters, especially, the population flow rate 
which can significantly change other parameters? effect in the final result. 
 
Meanwhile, the result of the epidemic final size has been determined, which is another indicator 
for epidemic analysis. In the following description, the results of experiments will provide a focus 
on different network properties and give analyses to the results.

fig 5.6 average degree’s effects to epidemic durations and final size 
 
? durations 
In these simulations, the degrees follow a power-law distribution with exponent parameter t = 
1.As shown in fig 5.6 b) ~ d), the duration time (blue line) increases along with the average 
degree increase, where the average degree at a relatively smaller level. By contrast, the durations 
go downward after the average degree over some threshold. For example, in picture b), we can 
see that the growing trend of durations stopped when the average degree equals 18. Furthermore, 
compared with picture b) and e) or c) and f), it can be seen that under the same structured network, 
the population flow rate will interfere the average degree’s effects. 
 
? final size 
In terms of epidemic final size, the result can be analysed by dividing into two groups: one is 
picture b), c) and d) compared with picture a) and e). Firstly, as picture b), c), d) shows that, the 
epidemic final size has a positive correlation with the average degree with given degree 
distribution. Their correlation values are 0.89, 0.96 and 0.81 for b) c) and d) respectively. By 
a)N=500, mu=0, flowing rate =0        b) N=500, mu=0.3, flowing rate =0         c) N=500, mu=0.9 flowing rate =0  
d) N=500, mu=0.1, flowing rate=0         e) N=500, mu=0.3 flowing rate =0.2     f) N=500, mu=0.9 flowing rate =0.2  
Disease transmission in different structured network  
54 
Yujie Chen   Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2011 
contrast, picture e) and f) describes a lost effect of average degree to final size. It is probably 
because of its higher population flowing rate than other simulations. 
 
In conclusion, firstly, it could be said that the effects of average degree to the duration time will 
depend on other network work properties such as community strength or population flow rate. In 
other words, its influence is not a linear function. Secondly, when analysing average degree? 
influence to the epidemic final size, the population flowing rate should be co-considered. To be 
exact, only when the population flowing rate is very low, will the average degree give positive 
effects to the final size. But it will lose its power when the population flow rate becomes higher.

? durations 
In the fig 5.7 a) ~ c), all the pictures reveal that the community strength has negative correlations 
with the durations. The trend increase of duration time stopped when the epidemic size tended to 
become stable. Moreover, as can be seen in figure c), when the epidemic breaks out in the entire 
network, the duration time will decrease with the community strength decrease. In brief, because 
of the community structure?s ability of epidemic constriction, it will limit the number of 
a) N = 500, avg. Degree = 5        b) N = 500, avg. Degree = 10                 c) N = 500, avg. Degree =20

infectious individuals during the epidemic process. Therefore, stronger community structure will 
lead to shorter duration time. On the other hand, if the total number of infectious individuals is 
the same, this is because a weaker community structure leads to a higher speed in disease spread, 
and it will finish the epidemic process quicker than in the case of a strong community structured 
network. 
  
By contrast, the figures from d) to f) present the downtrend of duration time with the community 
strength becoming weaker and weaker. This is because the population flow brings a lot of 
uncertainties. One of the probably reason is the movements event which lead to a quicker spread 
of the disease, which results in a relatively shorter duration time. 
 
? final size 
In terms of the correlation of community strength and epidemic final size, it is obvious that 
community structure can be one factor to reduce the final size. But when the dynamic network is 
considered, the effects come from this value to the final size will be lost.

To analyze the effects which come from overlap rate, the basic community strength should firstly 
a) N=500, degree=5, mu=0.1               b) N=500, degree=10, mu=0.3             c) N=500,

be fixed. In addition, the overlap rate is a property relating to community structure. Hence, as we 
can see form fig c) and f), the duration time experiences a random change with a different overlap 
rate. In graph a) and b), the duration time shows a weak positive correlation with overlap rate 
with correlation value equal to 0.678 and 0.562, respectively.  
 
In comparison, the duration line in fig. d) and e) represent downward trend with overlap ratio 
increase. Therefore, we can think the overlap rate is secondary parameter of community strength and 
average degree to affect durations. 
 
? final size 
Obtained from the pictures a), b),d) and e), we can see positive relations between the final size and 
overlap rate, especially clearly expressed by a strong community structured network a) and d). In 
statistics, the correlation values are 0.78,0.87,0.76 and 0.77 for a), b),d) and e).

As can be seen from fig 5.9 a) to f), all the blue lines (illustrating duration time) except picture d) go 
upward with moving events happening and hovering around at a relatively high value. Compared to a

number of results, it is thought that the population rate gives uncertain factors to the duration time. 
In other words, the effects of flow rate depend on different network situation. Additionally, based on 
l lot of experiments, for a determined network, the effects of population moving events can be 
predicted to levels of certainty.  
 
? final size 
From fig 5.9 a) to d), we can conclude that the population movements will promote the total number 
of infectious people. It is significantly different to consider the epidemic process in a static and 
dynamic network. But looking at the result from e) and f), the green line experiences an opposite 
behavior to the previous results. This probably is because that some other factors play a more 
important role in the very high density network. 
5.2.5 Different community structure with similar evaluated parameter 
 
Fig.5.10 Effects of different community structured network to duration time 
 
? durations 
The results in fig 5.10 come from 1000 nodes networks with average degree 6 presented in table 
4.10 group 1. As we can see that the process with disease parameter D = 0.1 and the parameter 
D= 0.9 are listed, which correspond to the process in fig 5.5 a) and b) respectively. When D = 0.1, 
the epidemic didn?t break out and didn?t spread through the entire network. Under this situation, 
because this specific hierarchical community structure restricts the process of disease spread, the 
total number of infectious individuals is much less than a simulation on other networks. This 
results in shorter durations for a hierarchical community structured network. By contrast, when D

=0.9, tends to produce a complete epidemic process. In other words, the disease spread 
throughout the entire network is quick. At this time, the duration of hierarchical structured 
network is expressed dramatically longer than others. This is because the speed of the disease 
spread is very slow in this kind of network structure, which leads to a long duration for the entire 
process. In conclusion, the hierarchical structure plays an important role in affecting epidemic 
process. 
 
? final size 
 
Fig.5.11 Effects of different community structured network to epidemic size 
 
As we can see from the fig 5.11, the process under D=0.1 and D =0.9 corresponds to the same 
one in fig 5.10 and the right side of the picture is the zoom-in of bar with D=0.9 in the left picture. 
Observed from these results, community structure can help disease control, especially in a 
hierarchical structured network. Even though D has a very high value 0.9, the hierarchical 
structure can protect some individuals from disease. To summarize, community structure can 
restrict epidemic size when an epidemic breaks out, especially a hierarchical structure which 
expresses significant effects within the epidemic process.

6. Conclusion and discussion 
Based on the experimental results, a lot of potential relations are found between the network 
parameters and the epidemic evolutionary trend. The previous chapter gave the detailed results 
for every experiment which was conducted, and analysed the possible reasons. In this chapter, we 
the clear and evident answers will be concluded for the five questions proposed in section 4.1 to 
list what we achieved in this research. 
 
Firstly, we found that the average degree for a given degree distribution and the community 
strength plays a significant role in affecting the epidemic growth rate. Both of them have obvious 
correlations with the growth rate. Average degree has a positive correlation whilst community 
strength has negative correlation. 
 
Secondly, for the network with strong community structure, the overlap ratio is a considerable 
factor to change epidemic growth rate, which can cause disease to spread to a greater extent. 
 
Thirdly, the population flow rate should be considered as an indispensable factor in how it affects 
the epidemic process in some specific network situation. For instance, in a sparse network with 
strong community structure, the flow rate is the most influential factor.  
 
Fourthly, we find that a hierarchical structured network can constrict the spread process 
dramatically. 
 
Fifthly, the final size of the epidemic is not so easy to predict by just one factor. The result is 
calculated depending on a number of network parameters. High population flow rate possibly 
leads to other factors to have less impact from their effects. In addition, if the other fixed 
parameters are weak, one parameter such as average degree and overlap rate will play a dominant 
role and have obvious correlation with epidemic final size. For example, if a static network has 
weak community structure, the final size of the epidemic will mainly depend on the average 
degree that the bigger average degree will lead to a bigger final size.  
 
Finally, duration time relies on epidemic growth rate and its final size. Hence its value is difficult 
to calculate. 
 
According to this conclusion, we can deduce two assumptions: 
 
1. Epidemic growth rate can be considered as a function of average degree, community strength 
(represented by mixing value ? in table 2.2), population flow rate overlap rate and time t for 
a specific given disease, which we can describe as:

???????? ?????? ????          
= ?(??????? ??????, ????????? ????????, ??????? ????, ?????????? ??????? ????) 
 
Additionally, all of the variables have positive correlations with the growth rate. The relations are 
described in fig 6.1 a), where w1 to w4 represent the weights for different input factors. 
 
2. Epidemic final size is the nonlinear function of a number of network input parameters. The 
model is illustrated in fig 6.1 b), where x1 to xn represents network factors. Moreover, these 
factors have effects on each other. In other words, they combine to give the conclusive result 
of the final size of the epidemic.

7. Future work 
In chapter 6, we proposed two models for epidemic growth rate and its final size calculation. But 
the exactly value cannot be given. Hence, we need to find out weights for each input parameters 
in order to express the exact formulation. 
 
Depends on a lot of observation, it was found that the trends of every simulation of these 
processes present the property of simple harmonic oscillation. Therefore, we can propose this 
function by the following formula: 
 
y = A ?    ( ?  ?)  (7.1) 
 
Where A is the inverse function of x.     ? ? can be considered as the function of average 
degree, community strength, overlap rate and population flow rate. In fig 7.1, we use function 7.1 
with different A , ?     ? to fit the trend of growth rate affected by a number of network 
parameters. In the following part, we will illustrate the idea of how to obtain the exact function in 
order to predict epidemic growth rate or duration times and its final size. 
 
 
fig 7.1 fitting function to simulate the changing trend of growing rate  
 
As shown in fig 7.1, it is an example of the first step of the future work for obtaining the equation 
for predicting the growth rate. After finding out the function that has a similar property with 
experiments on data relations, the concept of non-liner data regression will be used to fit the data 
trend. In addition, in the computer science area, the knowledge of machine learning, such as 
supervised learning can be used to help search the appropriate weights of these input variables.
