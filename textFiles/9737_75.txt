 Abstract 
 
Due to the CMOS technology scaling, digital systems that can consume the lowest 
quantity in power are required due to the large demand of portable and mobile devices 
or systems. One effective methodology for these ultra-low-power applications is to 
lower the power supply voltages to sub-threshold region. But the major limitations 
to reduce SRAM supply voltage are the stability degradation of the cell and the raise 
of process variation with process scaling, which increase the difficulty in the low 
power SRAM design. Large variability in nano-CMOS technologies can easily causes 
functional failures in the conventional 6T SRAM cell at low supply voltage because it 
can not provide large noise margin for proper operation.  
 
According to the previous research work, the read and write decoupled scheme can be 
considered as an effective strategy to enhance the SNM with low power operation. 
In this paper, we compare the performance of lots existing SRAM cells designed by 
using various process technologies and a novel 10T SRAM cell is presented in 
different CMOS technologies employing separate bitline and wordline for read and 
write operation and a virtual ground during the write operation to increase the 
immunity against the process variation. The impact of process parameter variations of 
the proposed 10T cell and the conventional 6T cell, with supply voltage scaling, is 
investigated to evaluate cell functionality and performance. Monte Carlo simulations 
indicate a 158% increase in the read stability, a 17% write time accelerated and a 80% 
power saving compared to the conventional 6T SRAM cell with a 48% area overhead. 
A Built In Current Sensor (BICS) technique is used in this proposed SRAM cell to  
estimate single event upsets (SEUs) in the cell working and idle conditions.  
The appearance of soft errors can be detected by generating an error signal to high.  
Hence, this BICS SRAM cell can monitor soft error when it is appeared on the cell at 
any second time in both operating and standby conditions.

Chapter 1: Introduction and Context 
Based on today’s integrated circuits design, a large amount of area and energy is 
consumed by cache memories. However, the modem microprocessor design, which 
occupies the majority of the overall chip area, requires lower power consumption and 
higher power efficiency due to increasing demand of battery powered mobile 
electronic devices. Thus the SRAM caches are proposed and investigated as the 
integral part of the advanced microprocessor, due to these portable devices and 
systems have both high speed requirements and complicated functionalities. One 
effective method used to improve the system performance is to increase the density of 
SRAM caches, but minimizing the size of transistor will lead to increase devices 
variation and leakage, which brings more challenges of developing SRAM with 
higher reliability and performance while ensuring the SRAM cell can meet the 
low-power –consumption requirements. The motivation of low power fault tolerant 
design of embedded SRAM memory in nano CMOS comes from two emerged 
requirements, low power consumption and Single-Event-Upset (SEU) analysis. 
 
1.1 Motivation 
1.1.1 Low power design 
Power management becomes the most important issue concerning the popularity of 
battery powered embedded systems and mobile devices. Reducing the power 
dissipation in these systems and devices can improve the system power efficiency, 
performance, reliability, while the speed is the secondary consideration. 
 
Many portable medical monitoring systems and devices either invasive or 
non-invasive, which are applied in the biomedical area, the low-power or even 
ultra-low-power dissipation design is proposed since the light-weight and long-term 
requirements. In nowadays, power is always the most crucial limitations as large 
battery is too heavy to make the monitoring device to be convenient for patients. For 
battery free monitoring systems which has the power harvest device for power supply, 
but the energy harvesting module can only supply small power consumption of 
normal semiconductor devices which lead the pressure of power dissipation is 
extremely critical. In space technology area, most of the power consumption of the 
satellites is provided by the solar panels during their lifetime, therefore if the power 
consumption could be minimized then the weight of satellites could be reduced and 
more other equipment can be carried on board as the solar panel will be decreased. 
Furthermore, although the rechargeable battery is very popular today, but the 
6 
 
operation time is still a critical limitation for most consumer level portable electronics 
devices. 
 
Reducing the supply voltage is the most efficient way to minimum the total power 
consumption in semiconductor devices. Either static or dynamic power dissipation 
can be reduced along with the supply voltage scaling down. Static power is lowered 
as the leakage current is reduced. The following equation represents the relationship 
between supply voltage and dynamic power dissipation: 
 
                          P
dyn ? f*Vdd
2 *C                    
Where, f is operation frequency of the circuits, Vdd is the power supply, and C is the 
load capacitance connected between ground and Vdd. To greatly reduce the Vdd to 
sub-threshold range of CMOS transistors can be used to achieve the low-power 
requirements. But if CMOS technology scales down, then the SRAMs are more 
sensitive to process variations in width, length, gate oxide thickness and have great 
different in threshold voltage, which will significantly affect the decrease of the 
supply voltage. The tranditional 6-Transistor SRAM will be out of use when the 
supply voltage is lowered to sub-threshold range, this is because of the greatly 
reduction of Static Noise Margin (SNM). Thus, the first stage is to design and 
functional and stable SRAM against process variation, this is applied to reduce the 
supply voltage which is in order to meet the low power requirements.  
1.1.2 Single Event Upset Detection Design 
Single Event Effects (SEE) in microelectronics are normally appeared when energetic 
particles his sensitive regions or paths of a microelectronic circuit in the natural space 
environment [2]. Once the SEE make a different of logic state, it is called Single 
Event Upset (SEU). For SEUs that applied in memory, there were several reports bot 
in terrestrial and space microelectronics back to 1970’s [3, 4]. They could be induced 
by two different ways: the alpha-particle contaminant packages for terrestrial 
memories and cosmic-rays for satellites concern subsystem. With the scaling of 
CMOS technologies, the major consideration of high reliability microelectronics 
design will be SEUs. Such as rocket science, even the error rate of one per 24 hours 
cannot be neglected [2].  
 
The SRAM which is working under sub-threshold voltage is more susceptible to 
SEUs than the SRAMs which is working under normal voltage, this because of the 
noise margin is limited by the lower supply voltage [5]. Thus, if it is intend to achieve 
ultra-low-power SRAMs design in space or other crucial applications with high 
requirement of reliability, the technology of detecting and correcting SEUs must be 
considered as initial work. The SEUs could be detected by the most recently 
techniques such as Build in Current Sensor (BICS). In traditional way, the SEUs can 
only be detected under the cell standby mode. As the SEUs is possible to appear at 
7 
 
any moment, i.e. either standby or operating mode. Thus, it is important to investigate 
another BICS technique that applied to the memory cells to detect the SEUs with 
higher efficiency. 
 
1.2 Aims and Objectives 
The primary aim of this particular project is to improve the existing memory cell 
structure and develop new approaches to design a new memory cell which is 
functional and highly stable against the nanoscale process variations, as well as 
significantly low power consumption. The effectiveness of the proposed solution will 
be validated through extensive HSPICE and Matlab simulations. In addition, the 
secondary aim is to implement an efficient technique to detect soft errors in SRAM 
Cells. 
 
The main objectives can be briefly described as follows: 
 
1.   Research methods and techniques for low voltage operation of memory cell. 
2. Research and analyze the performance of existing SRAM cells, compare the 
functionality and static noise margin (SNM) under process variation. 
3.   Research the existing test techniques using for soft errors detection in SRAM 
Cells 
4. Design and implement a new approach in order to improve the SRAM 
performance under process variation while reducing power dissipation, such as 
improve cell reliability and stability, increase the read and write margins, speed 
up read and write access time. 
5.   Implement an efficient technique to detect the occurrence of soft error in SRAM 
design. 
6.   Evaluate all the designs or solutions by HSPICE and Matlab simulations.

problem is described first. Next, previous successful low-power SRAM designs will

detail in Chapter 3. The whole architecture, include the involved designs are proposed

Detector (ATD), row decoder and column multiplexer etc. Chapter 5 will present

work will be described in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 respectively.

Chapter 2: Background and Previous work 
Like most sequencing elements in digital systems, memory cells used in on-chip 
memories can be divided into static and dynamic structures. While dynamic structure 
uses a capacitor needed to be periodically refreshed, static structure employs 
cross-coupled inverters to keep the data. Static memories are faster and more stable, 
but require more area per bit. 
 
2.1 Conventional SRAM Cell 
The most common used structure in today’s commercial SRAMs is the conventional 
6-Transistor (6T) SRAM Cell structure. It is the key component to all other kinds of 
memory cells.  
 
 
 
Figure 2.1: conventional 6T SRAM Cell 
 
Figure 2.1 shows the schematic of the conventional 6T SRAM Cell. It consists of a 
cross-coupled inverter pair formed by M1- M4 and two pass transistors M5 and M6. 
The storage nodes are specified by Q and QB. Assume node Q stores data “0” and QB 
stores data “1”. During standby operation when the circuit is idle, the word line “WL” 
is not asserted while two bitlines BL and BLB both remain at precharged value Vdd. 
During the read operation when the data is requested, the word line “WL” is asserted 
which turns on the pass transistors M5 and M6. The values on storage nodes Q and 
QB will be transferred to the bitlines BL and BLB respectively by leaving BLB at its 
precharged value and discharging BL to GND through M5 and M2. As the bitlines BL 
and BLB will have a small difference of voltage between them, a sense amplifier is 
required to sense which line has got the higher voltage and to determine whether the 
output should be “1” or “0”. 
10 
 
During the write operation when updating the SRAM Cell’s contents, first apply the 
new value that will be written to the two bitlines. If the operation is writing “1”, we 
should set BL to “1” and BLB to “0”. WL is then asserted and the pass transistors M5 
and M6 are both enabled. BL will charge storage node Q to Vdd through M5, while 
on the BLB side, transistor M4 will pull BLB down to GND. Therefore, the values on 
storage nodes Q and QB are both reversed which indicate new data has been written 
into the SRAM Cell. 
 
In the conventional 6T SRAM (Figure 2.1), the cell is required to be stable during the 
read operation and writeable during the write operation ignoring redundancy. 
However, the 6T SRAM Cell has poor read stability as during read operation the pass 
transistors M5 and M6 provides direct access to the SRAM cell storage nodes. The 
storage node Q will rise above “0” because of the voltage division between the pass 
transistor M5 and the driver transistor M6.  
 
Therefore, improper sizing of the pass transistors and storage inverters will cause a 
read upset. For example, a stored “0” can be rewritten by “1” if the voltage of node Q 
rises higher than the Vth of transistor M4 to pull node QB down to “0” and 
accordingly pull node Q up to “1”. Ignoring the body and short-channel effects of the 
transistors, the maximum allowed voltage V? on node Q during the read operation 
can be expressed below:

Since the 6T SRAM cell is symmetrical, CR is the same for transistors M4 and M6. 
 
 
The relationship between V? and CR is shown in Figure 2.2 (the cell is simulated in 
CMOS 130nm technology, VVDD 2.1? ). In order to achieve a non-destructive read 
operation, CR should be not less than one and can be varied which lies on the target 
application of the SRAM Cell. Larger CRs cause higher leakage current (speed as 
well) and stability during read access but larger area, while smaller CRs provides a 
more compact SRAM Cell with moderate speed and stability. To ensure the cell 
stability and reduce the leakage current, it is suggested to employ a minimum width 
with a bit larger than the minimal length pass transistors and a minimal length with a 
bit larger than minimal width driver transistors.

Cell Ratio (CR) in a 6T CMOS SRAM cell (simulated in CMOS 0.13 ? m 
technology,Vdd=1.2V) [43] 
 
Therefore, the read stability can be improved if providing strong storage inverters but 
weak pass transistors. However, for reaching higher write ability, the opposite is 
desirable to strengthen the pass transistors while weaken the storage inverters. This is 
because the voltage on the “1” storage node can be defined as a function of the 
pull-up ratio (PR) of a 6T SRAM Cell, which can be expressed as follows:

Since the 6T SRAM cell is symmetrical, PR is the same for transistors M3 and M6. 
 
 
The relationship between pull-up ratio and voltage drop on “1” storage node is shown 
in Figure 2.3 (the cell is simulated in CMOS 130nm technology, DDV =1.2V). The 
pull-up transistors are used to keep the high level on the “1” storage node and prevent 
it will not discharge through the driver transistors due to the off-state leakage current 
during the data retention and to provide data transition( low to high) when overwriting. 
During the data overwriting, in order to pull the voltage on the “1” storage node 
below THnV , it is desirable that the W/L of the pull-up transistor should be smaller than 
the W/L of the pass transistor. So during the write access, it is required to provide a 
12 
 
strong pass transistor and weak pull-up transistors, especially for the worst process 
conditions, such as in the fast PMOS and slow NMOS corner. Thus despite 6T SRAM 
Cell is the most common structure used in today’s SRAMs, the need of read stability 
and write ability cannot be optimized simultaneously because of the same pass 
transistors used during both read and write operation.

2.2 SRAM Cell Stability 
2.2.1 Introduction to SRAM Stability 
The stability of embedded SRAM is usually measured and analyzed by the dynamic 
and static performance during the SRAM normal operation state. As CMOS 
technology scales down in the nanometer region, it makes the designer hard to 
achieve a reliable behavior as the process variation defects the performance of the 
memory cell more frequently. 
 
There are many published designs to evaluate and enhance the SRAM stability. [6] In 
2006, Khellah et al. [7] suggested the wordline and bitline pulsing schemes to 
improve SRAM cell failure rates at low power supply voltages. Another successful 
improvement is published by Suzuki et al. [8] described a SRAM with an 8-T SRAM 
cell that copes with cell disturbances in unselected columns during a write operation. 
In 2007, Khellah et al. [9] presented a method to measure the dynamic SRAM 
stability degradation due to the power supply noise. These popular techniques are 
13 
 
based on the memory cell stability characteristic in both read and write events and 
have improved the overall cell stability. 
 
2.2.2 SRAM SNM and Process Variation 
2.2.2.1 SNM and Process Variation Definition 
Several different ways have been proposed to define the stability of SRAM [10], 
while Static Noise Margin (SNM) and its analytical criteria introduced by Seevinck 
[11], are more common used to estimate the SRAM Cells’ stability. The noise margin 
is defined as the input voltage to output voltage characteristic, VTC (Voltage Transfer 
Characteristic). Generally, it is the maximum spurious signal that can be tolerated by 
the cell while maintaining the cell operating state. Assume that the noise pulse is long 
enough for enabling the circuit to react, such as the noise is static or dc. Therefore, 
static noise margin is proposed if the noise is a dc source and can represent the 
minimum DC noise margin to affect the cell operation state and help to evaluate the 
stability of memory cell with a static approach.  
 
As shown in Figure 2.4, consider that the 6T SRAM Cell has two cross-coupled 
inverters INV1 and INV2, the SNM can be defined as the maximum value of Vn that 
can be accept by the cell to ensure the correct operation.  
 
 
 
Figure 2.4: Cross coupled inverter with noise source [35] 
 
In the conventional 6T SRAM Cell(Figure 2.1),the SNM can be found during the 
SRAM Cell standby and read operations, defined as read SNM and hold SNM 
respectively. During the read access, pass transistors M5 and M6 are both turned on, 
two bitlines BL and BLB are precharged to Vdd, the internal node which stores “0” 
will be possible to pull upward to “1” because of the voltage division effect between 
pass transistors and drive transistors, so the read SNM is degraded. In standby 
operation, the pass transistors M5 and M6 are both off, hence the hold SNM is much 
larger than read SNM which indicate that read SNM has less resilience to noise and is 
14 
 
more crucial in evaluating the stability of SRAM Cell. In the following part of this 
paper, the SNM is represented to read SNM unless specified. 
 
 
Figure 2.5: SNM estimation based on maximum square [36] 
 
From the butterfly characteristic curves of the SRAM Cell, shown in Figure 2.5, the 
SNM can be estimated by the largest square box that can be fitted inside the curves. 
The edge length of the largest square is the SNM. Therefore, the larger square box is 
obtained in the butterfly curve, the higher SNM as well as higher stability of the 
SRAM Cell is achieved in the SRAM cell design.  
 
An effective simulation method for measuring the SNM was also introduced by 
Seevinck [10]. The maximum value of the difference between the outputs 
Vout1-Vout2 can be computed from the simulation, which is equal to the diagonals of 
the largest square fitted in the butterfly characteristic curves. SNM can be achieved by 
multiplying the value of Vout1-Vout2 by 2/1 . Therefore, in the following parts of this 
paper, this simulation method will be applied for the stability comparison of different 
SRAM Cell designs.  
 
As CMOS technology scales down, the feature size of transistor is decreased which 
makes difficult in fabricating such small structure consistently across a die or a wafer 
[12]. Due to the small geometry of the transistor, its parameters are easily to vary die 
to die or within the same die. Therefore, the inability to obtain small geometric 
transistor size and the inability to control dopant fluctuation induced threshold voltage 
will lead to the functional failures in SRAM Cell, as well as unexpected parametric 
yield degradation [13],[14]. 
 
Several factors, such as changes in dielectric thickness, substrate, polysilicon and 
implant impurity levels; surface charge; and lithographic process, need to be 
considered because it may affect these transistor parameter variations. Normally, 
variations in process parameters can be classified into inter-die and intra-die 
variations. Inter-die variations represent the random variations that occur between 
15 
 
different chips in one wafer or different wafers, whereas intra-die variations represent 
the random variations that occur between different devices and interconnects in the 
same chip [13]. 
 
Random intra-die variations which are primarily caused by the threshold voltage 
variation due to the random dopant fluctuations will lead to several parametric failures 
in the SRAM Cell [13,14], such as changes on data during the read operation, 
unsuccessfully write the data into the cell, data flipping at a lower operating voltage 
when the cell is idle. 
 
Environmental factors and physical factors can be considered to be two main sources 
in process variation [15]. The environmental factors depend on the operating 
conditions of the circuit, such as temperature, supply voltage. And another main 
source physical factors is owing to the limitations in the fabrication process, including 
the effective channel length and width, gate oxide thickness and threshold voltage 
variations. SRAM can fail due to any of the above parametric variations. 
 
2.2.2.2 Process Variations effect on SRAM SNM 
As discussed above, process variations in transistor parameters such as channel length 
(L), width (W), gate oxide thickness (TOX) and threshold voltage (Vth) have a 
significant effect on the SRAM Cell functionality, and caused unexpected degradation 
in yield.  
 
Threshold Voltage (Vth) Variation: Vth variations due to dopant fluctuations, line 
edge roughness, poly gate grain size variations and systematic variations will greatly 
reduced the read and write margins of memory cells. If Vth is varied in one of the 
transistors, it will cause the device mismatch which will directly change the shape of 
VTC, and thus lead to a significant impact on the SNM. As the driver transistor Vth 
Variation has the most effect on VTC due to its larger W/L transistor ratio, thus it 
plays a dominant role in SNM variations. Therefore, Vth reduction in the access 
transistor of SRAM cell will improve the SNM.  
 
The dopant fluctuation in the channel region will lead to a random variation in the 
threshold voltage of the SRAM transistor, which acts as a Gaussian distribution. Thus, 
the randomness of channel dopant distribution will become another major source for 
the SNM analysis. It is suggested that cell ratios should be increased to gain an 
acceptable SNM and yield in the future SRAM Cells. 
 
Operating Voltages Variation: variations in power supply voltage (Vdd), bit line 
voltage(Vbl) or word line voltage(Vwl), will greatly affect the SNM of an SRAM cell  
Figure 2.6 shows the results of the SNM during hold and read operations with two 
different power supply voltages Vdd and 2/3Vdd applied to an 6T SRAM Cell with 
16 
 
minimum transistor size. It can be clearly visible that when lowering the supply 
voltage, it will have lower impact on SNM in both HOLD and Read cases.

Figure 2.6: "Butterfly" curve during HOLD & READ operation for different power 
supply voltages. [37] 
 
The effect of bit line voltage variation can be discussed based on Figure 1.7. The 
write operation is occupied in the region with the bit line voltage is lower than the 
write margin. Thus write margin is a crucial parameter to determine the SRAM Cell 
write stability. In Figure 2.7(b), four regions can be found between ground and 
precharge points when the bitline voltage increases. Thus balance between bitline 
voltage variation and cell stability need to be carefully considered. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.7: Read and Write regions in SRAM Cell [37] 
 
Somehow, in fact, if the transistors are really tiny, the parameters of the transistor will 
be varied from die to die or even in the exactly same die. Which means each transistor 
in a die or wafer is totally different. Therefore, the considerations of design based on 
the nominal models may be wrong because the models are either overestimations or 
underestimations of real values, so the resultant circuit may not be practical. 
 
17 
 
In conclusion, with the CMOS technology scaling, process variations are of great 
concerns during ICs fabrication process as they will degrade the performance of the 
cell, and thus deviate the designer’s original intent based on the nominal models. 
Therefore, models and methods for dealing with process variations are needed to be 
carefully investigated for high performance circuit design. In the following part of this 
paper, we will present the impact of such process variations to evaluate the SRAM 
Cell’s functionality and stability.  
 
2.3 Previous SRAM Cell Design 
Different SRAM Cells’ structures have been implemented at various technologies to 
improve the stability and power consumption of the cells. Since in conventional 6T 
SRAM Cell, the conflicting need of read stability and write ability causes the two 
conditions cannot be optimized at the same time, hence most of the previous cell 
designs provide separate read and write port to decouple read and write access. 
Therefore, the read SNM is increased although need additional transistors which will 
increase the cell area. 
2.3.1  7T SRAM Cell 
(i) At 90nm CMOS Technology 
This proposed 7T SRAM Cell develops a novel write mechanism to control the 
feedback connection between the two cross-coupled inverters, as shown in Figure 2.8. 
An extra transistor N5 is used to switch on or off the feedback connection and the cell 
relies only on bitline BL_bar during the write operation.  
 
 
 
Figure 2.8: 7T SRAM Cell  
 
Upon read and write access, the two bitlines BL and BL_bar are precharged to Vdd. 
The write operation starts by not selecting write signal (W) which means turning N5 
18 
 
off to disconnect the feedback between the inverters. Then Word line WL is asserted 
while read signal R is set to “0”, N3 turns on and N4 is off. Since the two inverters 
INV1 (P1 and N2), INV2 (P2 and N2) are one followed by the other one, BL_bar 
transfers the complement of the data to node Q2 through transistor N3, the output of 
INV2 will drive INV1 and then Q_bar is developed. The bitline BL_bar do not need 
to be discharged for every write operation, since during write “0”, BL_bar is kept to 
Vdd. 
 
During read “0” operation, as transistor N5 is turned on, the cell totally behaves like 
the conventional 6T SRAM Cell, the critical path consists of N2 and N4, can be 
shown in Figure 2.9(a). Whereas in reading “1” operation, the critical path is formed 
by N1, N5 and N3, as shown in Figure 2.9(b). The three transistors need to be 
carefully sized to avoid reducing the drive ability of the cell. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.9: Read path (a) Q=”0” (b) Q=”1”  
 
The write power consumption is reduced in this SRAM Cell design as the activity 
factor of discharging the bitlines is below “1”. Proper transistor sizing will provide 
acceptable read delay and SNM of the cell. Compared to the conventional 6T SRAM 
cell, the cell area is increased in this design.  
 
 
2.3.2  8T SRAM Cell 
(i) At 90nm technology 
A dual-port cell (8T SRAM Cell) is implemented by adding two transistors to a 
conventional 6T SRAM Cell, shown in Figure 2.10. The isolation of data retention 
structure and data output structure means that the cell disturbs during the read 
operation are significantly eliminated due to the separate read/write bitlines and word 
lines.  
 
19 
 
 
Figure 2.10: 8T SRAM Cell  
 
As shown in Figure 2.10, during the read operation when node Q stores “0” and node 
QB stores”1”, transistor N5 is kept on and RWL is asserted, therefore read bitline 
RBL is discharged to Gnd through N5 and N6 and data “0” is read out.  
 
This 8T cell design also ensure there is no relationship between the read SNM and 
cell current Icell. The value of read SNM in this design is increased compared to the 
conventional 6T cell, but the cell current Icell is not degraded. It is also possible to 
decrease the threshold voltage of the NMOS transistors to optimize Icell. This 8T cell 
has 30% area overhead than the conventional 6T cell due to the additional two 
transistors and contact area of the WWL within a cell.  
 
 
(ii) At 65nm technology 
 An ultra dynamic voltage scaling 8T cell is proposed to provide a virtual ground for 
read buffer of the accessed cell and remain at Vdd for the cells which are not 
accessed. The MCHd is also a virtual node and its voltage can be pulled down during 
the write operation in order to weaken the pull-up transistor to improve cell write 
ability. In addition, low operating voltage at about 420mv can be successfully 
achieved in this 8T Cell design. The limitations of this cell design are the area 
overhead and design complexity. 
 
As the read bitline RBL will be precharged to Vdd upon read and write access, thus 
no leakage current flows in the un-accessed cells and the cell number added to one 
bitline can be increased. In order to ensure the read buffer sink enough to enable 
more cells attached to one row, a charge pump circuit is proposed which can be 
shown in Figure 2.11. Sense amplifier redundancy concept can be used to decrease 
the sensing error caused by the offset in a given area constraint [16]. 
 
20 
 
 
Figure 2.11:Charge pump circuit schematic 
 
(iii) At 45nm technology 
In the dual-port 8T Cell design, a precharge circuit must be carried out on the read 
bitline RBL to ensure RBL can be discharged to Gnd through the two NMOS 
transistors at the read port when reading “0”. Thus there is a certain amount of power 
consumption during the precharge operation. Besides the precharge circuit, a bitline 
keeper is required, as shown in Figure 2.12. This bitline keeper scheme will worsen 
the read out time and make the delay overhead increases when lowering the supply 
voltage. 
 
Figure 2.12: Bitline keeper schematic 
2.3.3  9T SRAM Cell 
(i) At 65nm technology 
The 9T SRAM Cell is proposed in order to improve the cell stability and reduce 
leakage power, as shown in Figure 2.13. This new scheme separates the data during 
the read access and its read SNM is improved by 2 compared to the conventional 6T 
SRAM Cell. During the standby mode, this SRAM Cell is in the condition of super 
cutoff sleep, which makes the leakage power consumption reduced by 22% compared 
to the conventional 6T SRAM Cell at 65nm CMOS technology. 
 
21 
 
 
 
Figure 2.13: 9T SRAM Cell  
 
2.3.4  10T SRAM Cell 
(i) At 65nm technology 
The dual port 10T SRAM structure can be shown in Figure 2.14. It also consists of 
separate read and write ports which is able to improve and read stability and write 
ability simultaneously.  
 
 
 
Figure 2.14: 10T SRAM Cell  
 
The write bitilines WBL & WBLB and read bitline RBL are precharged to Vdd upon 
the read and write access. During read operation, assume that QB stores “1” and Q 
stores “0”, then RBL will be discharged to Gnd through the read access transistors and 
data “0” can be read out. Otherwise, RBL will remain at Vdd and data “1” can be read 
out.  
 
22 
 
The feature of this SRAM Cell structure is the four decoupled read access transistors. 
They are implemented in order to enable more cells to be attached to one bitline. 
Therefore, the leakage current does not depend on the stored data any more. During 
the standby mode, the drain voltage of P3 is Vdd and the leakage current will flow 
from the cell to the bitline no matter what the data is. If the cell is not idle and stores 
data “0”, then the level of RBL is determined by the read current of the cells that have 
been accessed and leakage current of the other unaccessed cells. If the cell stores data 
“1”, then RBL will be kept at Vdd. Thus the bitline voltage fluctuating during read 
process could be able to achieve as possible as 130mV at a 0.2 V supply voltage for a 
1k cell bitline. [17]. 
 
The main limitations for this design are the area overhead and the cell speed might be 
scarified in order to maintain the low power consumption.  
At 45nm Technology 
A 10T SRAM with a single end read bitline, shown in Figure 2.15, is proposed at 
45nm technology. It has two additional PMOS transistors and an additional signal 
/RWL which is reverse to the signal RWL to control the transistor P4 compared to the 
8T SRAM Cell design. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.15: 10T Single End SRAM Cell  
 
In this design, there is no need to precharge the read bitline RBL because the inverter 
at the read port can entirely charge/discharged the RBL. During the read operation, 
when the signals RWL and /RWL are both asserted, transistors N6 and P4 are kept on. 
The data on the storage node can be connected to the RBL, thanks to the inverter. A 
large amount of power can be saved in this design when take the consideration of a 
sequence of random data in order to keep the transition possibility of the RBL at 50%. 
Since in these single end read access SRAM Cell design, the leakage current of 
bitlines will cause the bitline swing reduction. In order to solve this problem, another 
10T SRAM Cell with differential read bitlines is proposed, as shown in Figure 2.16. 
 
23 
 
 
Figure 2.16: 10T Differential SRAM Cell 
 
In this design, four additional NMOS transistors are appended for read bitlines RBL 
and /RBL compared to the conventional 6T SRAM Cell. The precharge circuits are 
needed for both RBL and /RBL. During the read operation, RWL is set to high and 
read bitlines RBL or /RBL will be discharged from the precharged Vdd to Gnd 
depending on the values at stored node Q and QB.  
 
Since the two write access transistors N3 and N4 are possible to reduce the write 
ability of the cell if the sizes are improper, A higher voltage 4/3 Vdd has been 
employed to the gate of these two transistors to minimum the cell area without 
increasing the sizes of them. The sense amplifier used in this design is replaced by a 
latch-type sense amplifier in order to minimize the sensing margin. According to [18], 
this 10T SRAM Cell design can operate properly when the supply voltage is lowered 
to 320 mV. 
 
Existing SRAM Cell Summary: 
In conclusion, the most important part in the existing SRAM Cell design is to improve 
the read SNM of the cell via different topologies. They use either separate read and 
write port scheme or enlarge the size of read and write access transistors for higher 
SNM. The cell can operate properly at the supply voltage as low as 320mV once 
improving the read SNM. Since the speed of cell is not the top priority in such low 
power SRAM Cell design, sense amplifiers are not recommended to be implemented. 
Therefore, an inverter-type read buffer is more desirable to be used to balance the 
speed of the cell.

2.4 SEU in SRAM Design and Estimation Methods 
2.4.1 SRAM Soft Error and Single-Event Upset 
In recent years, there has been great interest in discussing about the radiation 
immunity of electronic circuit. This issue is particularly severe in a modern processor 
design. Since a great amount of register files/SRAMs will be added in a processor 
chip, then these devices occupy a large area in the chip and catch a large amount of 
the particles in radiation condition which may increase the soft error rate of the chip.  
 
Errors existed in the SRAMs can be divided into hard and soft errors. Hard errors are 
permanent faults which means it cannot be corrected by rewritten [19]. Soft errors are 
caused by the excess charge carriers due to the external radiations and lead to change 
the internal data states [20]. The heavy particle striking on the sensitive nodes of the 
SRAM will cause electron-hole pairs and this ionization impact will lead to the 
changes on data [20]. Therefore, soft errors will significantly affect the functionality 
and reliability of SRAMs. The correction of the soft errors can be achieved by 
rewriting the correct data into the cell to cover the false [19]. 
 
If soft error is the main reason that caused the cell reliability reduction, then it can be 
called as single event upset (SEU) which are induced principally by external radiation 
due to the high energy neutrons that generated by cosmic rays and alpha particles that 
generated by packaging materials. [21]. As CMOS technology scales down, SEU can 
result in a big problem for the system as soft errors are more frequent to occur due to 
the unsteady isotopes in the packaging material of a chip [22]. Therefore, avoid SEU 
is vital for progressing the system towards technology scaling.  
 
The mechanism of SEU in SRAM Cell, as shown in Figure 2.17, is the most approved 
mechanism proposed by Dodd [23]. Assume that node Q is low and node QB is high, 
then transistors N2 and P1 are turned off, and transistors N1 and P2 are kept on.   
 
 
Figure 2.17: Mechanism of SEU in SRAM Cell [38] 
 
25 
 
During SRAM hold mode, the drain junction of N2 and P1 are the two sensitive 
locations due to they are in off state. The drain of these off MOS transistors creates 
the reverse-biased PN junctions and substrates as well, as shown in Figure 2.18, 
which is easy to be affected by particle strikes. When the particle strikes go through 
the PN connections, the electrons will pass through the positive voltage of 
reverse-biased junction and holes move toward the negative voltage side. 
 
Figure 2.18: Particle strike and charge generation [34] 
 
Suppose that the particle strikes on transistor N2, the movement of charges causes a 
transient current flowing through the stuck transistor. The source current of restoring 
transistor P2 is keep trying to balance the particle-induced current. Since transistor P2 
only has a finite channel conductance, it will result in a voltage drop at storage node 
QB. If the voltage drop is large enough to cause the flip of data which means the 
collected charge exceeds the critical charge. The critical charge is defined as the 
minimum amount of charge required to upset a circuit node. Therefore, the generation 
of single-event current transient pulse at the sensitive nodes of the cell causing the 
voltage transient pulse is actually the mechanism that results in the flip of data in 
SRAM Cells. Therefore, SEUs in SRAM Cell are always simulated by injecting the 
current transient pulse at the sensitive nodes of the cell. The shape of the current pulse 
can be expressed below:

Where Q is the charge collection because of the particle strike, rt  is the rise time and

2.4.2 SEUs Estimation Methods 
 
To achieve SRAM Cell SEU immunity, there have been a number of solutions 
published [24]. Most of these solutions can be divided into three categories: 1) 
hardening, 2) recovery, 3) protection.  
 
Hardening technique is proposed by inserting transistors acted as the duplication of 
the SRAM cell to make the cell is not susceptible to SEUs [25]. The main drawback 
of this technique is the SRAM area overhead 
 
Recovery technique is implemented by inserting the current monitor to detect SEUs 
on the fly and mitigate the effects of single event by applying Error Correcting Codes 
(ECC) or redundancy [25]. However, ECC is possible to cause SRAM area overhead 
and more power consumption. This technique only allows the errors to be detected 
and corrected under the reading process of the faulty bit, which leads the delay 
between the appearance of the SEU and correction. Furthermore, this will produce 
accumulation of SEUs. 
 
Protection technique uses capacitors connected to the sensitive nodes in SRAM Cell 
[26]. So when particle strikes on these nodes, the capacitors get charged and absorb 
the excessive charge. The limitation of this technique is it can only function well for 
standby condition. While for operating condition, it will affect adversely cell access 
time.  
 
These drawbacks in the techniques above can be solved by applying Built In Current 
Sensor (BICS). This technique is considered to be an effective approach to detect the 
SEUs in SRAM Cell. Traditional BICS [27] are proposed by monitoring the static 
current consumption in the circuit, as shown in Figure 2.19.  
 
27 
 
 
 
Figure 2.19: Traditional BICS structure  
 
The traditional BICS structure includes two comparators and one asynchronous latch, 
and each comparator basically consists of two parts: 1) the current mirror, which is 
used to amplify the upset current; 2) the current source inverter, which is used to 
convert the amplified current pulse into logic level voltage. In Figure, Svdd is a 1 to 0 
data flipping detector, used for observing data changes from 1 to 0 caused by radiation, 
and similarly Sgnd is used for observing 0 to 1 data changes. Both Svdd and Sgnd 
generate logic level voltage pulses to indicate data flipping and the two output pulses 
are connected to the asynchronous latch. The latch will be triggered and the error 
signal Err1 will be given as high when any of the two outputs goes high. The 
asynchronous latch could be reset by the reset signal (RST) after the upset is founded 
and during R/W operation. The reference voltage generator is presented to provide the 
biasing voltage Bv, Bg for Svdd and Sgnd. This BICS is only capable to detect soft 
error under standby condition.  
 
It is known that the soft error not only occurs during standby condition, but also 
occurs in the SRAM Cell during operating conditions. It has been researched that data 
can flip in SRAM Cell during the read operation or at the end of write access, by 
injecting a current pulse to model the SEUs strikes [28]. Thus, a more reliable BICS 
structure should be investigated which is able to detect soft errors at both standby and 
operating conditions, which will be discussed in the following part of this thesis 
project.

Chapter 3: Challenges in SRAM design 
There are several challenges when the supply voltage is scaled down to sub-threshold 
region, including the stability of cells, reduced number of cells per bitline and sense 
amplifier problems. Modern CMOS nanometer technology and supply voltage 
scalings bring several challenges for future high performance SRAM Cells design. 
They have a great impact on stability of cells, reduced number of cells attached to one 
bitline, sense amplifier problems and soft error tolerance. 
3.1 Stability of SRAM Cells 
When applying the standard supply voltage to the conventional 6T SRAM Cell for 
different CMOS technology, the SNM can be large enough to make the cell stable and 
the soft error rate can be acceptable. However, when lowering the supply voltage, 
especially for scaling down to sub-threshold region, the SNM reduces significantly. It 
was reported that Vdd cannot be scaled down below 0.7 V for a conventional 6T 
SRAM to function well in 65nm CMOS technology [30,31] 
 
Table 3.1summarizes the hold SNMs of cell under different supply voltage in different 
technology [29]. The hold SNMs are 356.2mV, 346.0mV and 335.2mV in 130nm, 
90nm and 65nm technologies when the supply voltage is 1V. But when scaling down 
the supply voltage to 0.4v which makes the SRAM operate in sub-threshold region, 
the SNMs are reduced to 153.8mV, 148.4mV and 142.5mV respectively. Therefore, It 
is known that for traditional 6T SRAM, the minimum value of Vdd will not lower 
than 0.7V for a SRAM to achieve full functionalities in 65mm CMOS technology.

Table 3.1: Hold SNM for different supply voltage in CMOS technologies [29] 
 
29 
 
As CMOS technology scales, the channel lengths of the transistors are variable and to 
be sub-wavelength of light. This will worsen the process variation problem, as it will 
be difficult to control the typical 3? of the critical dimensions within 10% variation. 
Since one chip will be made of several billion transistors, some of these transistors 
may have more than 3? critical dimension variation which will mismatch with the 
others, and hence will lead to the SRAM functional failures and affect SRAM Cell 
Stability. 
 
 
3.2 Sense Amplifier Problems 
In SRAM design, sense amplifier plays an important role as it affects the cell speed 
and power consumption of SRAM Cell. Since sense amplifier are always used in 
SRAM Cell design for fast sensing which typically consists of two matched 
transistors within a positive feedback environment, it needs to be carefully examined 
under process variations due to CMOS technology scaling. The process variation 
leads to mismatch between the pair of sense transistors and hence significant yield 
loss. It was reported that not all sense amplifiers can function well in a wide supply 
voltage range and are speedy enough [32]. Although all transistors in these sense 
amplifiers can work when lowering the supply voltage, the speed of the cell is 
incredibly lower than which under the normal operation condition. 
 
 
3.3 Soft Error Tolerance 
As technology scales down, process variations will also affect soft error tolerance 
which will remain a reliability challenge in the future SRAM Cell design. Critical 
charge in each sensitive node reduces and will cause flip on data more easily. 
Therefore, the total number of nodes per chip increases which will cause reliability 
reduction. In addition, with smaller supply voltage applied, the noise margin of the 
cell is decreased which causes the cell is more susceptible to soft errors.  
 
 
3.4 Reduced Number of Cells attached to one bitline 
The sum of cells that can be attached to one bitline depends on the ratio between the 
read current I read  of the accessed cell and the leakage current I leakage  of the 
un-accessed cells, as shown in Figure 3.1. 
30 
 
 
Figure 3.1: leakage current scheme in one bitline [39] 
 
When lowering the supply voltage of SRAM Cell, this current ratio is reduced and 
hence less cells can be driven to one bitline which will limit the cell density. It has 
been noticed that most of the 64 cells are be able to be attached to one bitline only if 
there is no any other technique was employed. This value is too small when compare 
to more than 256 cells attached to one bitline for most currently available memories in 
the markets. 
 
 
Other elements in SRAM such as decoder design, read and write sequences 
generation circuits, address transient detector, are also needed to be implemented 
properly under the process variation, although they are not the major concerns of 
SRAM design compared to the cell and sense amplifier. In conclusion, the design of 
SRAM will be faced with several serious challenges to achieve no performance 
penalty and minimized power penalty under supply voltage reduction and process 
variation.

Chapter 4: Low Power SRAM memory Design 
4.1 Overview of the chip design 
Figure 4.1 shows an example of the SRAM chip architecture. It consists of row 
address inputs A0 to A7 and column address IOs A8 to A10, as well as data IOs D0 to 
D7. WR and RD signals are used to enable the write and read operation respectively.  
 
 
 
Figure 4.1: SRAM chip architecture [40] 
 
The chip can be divided into two main parts, the memory core and periphery elements. 
The memory core includes the cell, dummy column and row, boost circuit and sense 
amplifiers. Their functions are described below: 
 
?  Cell: the key component in SRAM design used to store the data. In Figure 4.1, the 
example SRAM chip contains a cell array with 8 columns, 256?8 bits on each 
column. 
 
?Dummy Column: This column is designed to produce the activate signal for sense 
amplifiers. For example, in Figure 4.1, the dummy column contains 256 bits, as well 
as same capacitance as that in cell array. But the read current is doubled compared to 
that of cell array in order to generate the Sense Amplifier enable signal.  
32 
 
?Dummy Row: This row is designed to obtain the dummy read wordline signal when 
the cells in dummy column are under read operation. With this additional row 
implemented, it ensures that the dummy read wordline have the capacitance as same 
as that in the cell array of the wordines. 
 
 
?Sense Amplifier: Latch-type SA with two differential inputs is needed in this SRAM 
chip in order to amplify the voltage coming off the bitlines. It also helps to decrease 
the delay times in the chip, as well as power savings.  
 
?Boost Circuit: This circuit is applied to generate the higher voltage to run the write 
access transistors under write process. It also can raise the input voltage to double of 
Vdd. For example, the highest allowed voltage in 130nm CMOS technology is about 
1.4V, then the maximum supply voltage in this SRAM chip can be reduced to 0.7V 
with the effect of boost circuit.  
 
The functions of some other important elements inside this SRAM chip can be listed as 
follows: 
 
?Bitline conditioning circuits: it is used to precharge the bitlines upon both read and 
write operations. 
 
?Row Address Decoder and Column Multiplexer: Row Address Decoder is used to 
select a wordline inside the SRAM chip, while Colunm Multiplexer is for connecting 
selected bitline to the selected dataline. In Figure 4.1, since the chip contains 8 row 
addresses and 3 column addresses, then an 8-256 row decoder and a 3-8 column 
decoder are required for this SRAM chip.  
 
?Address Transition Detector (ATD): Address-Transition Detector (ATD) is 
implemented in asynchronous SRAM to generate a pulse of an expected period on 
every address transition. 
 
?Data Buffer: Since data bus is bi-directional, the data buffer should be designed to 
latch the data during the read access and be turned off during the write access.

4.2 Detailed SRAM Design 
4.2.1 SRAM Cell Design 
A novel 10T SRAM Cell is proposed in this project, shown in Figure 4.2, decouples 
read and write operation by using the isolated read-port transistors (N6,N7,P3). 
Therefore, the cell can achieve no constrained read and write stability optimization 
compared to the conventional 6T SRAM Cell. A cross coupled inverter pair inside this 
cell is used to store a single bit of data. The write bitlines WB and WBB are used to 
transfer the data into the cell by the access transistors N3 and N4 during the write 
operation, while the read bitline RB is used for reading the data from the cell by the 
read-port transistors during the read operation. In addition, the two separate control 
signals, read wordline RWL and write wordline WWL, are implemented in this cell in 
order to manage the read and write operations.   
 
 
 
Figure 4.2: proposed SRAM Cell Schematic  
 
Write operation: 
A tail NMOS transistor N5 which connected to the pull-down transistors N1 and N2 is 
used for saving the power during the write operation. Switching activity of this 
transistor depends on the read wordline RWL. Prior to a write operation, the write 
bitlines WB and WBB are precharged to Vdd. Initially, assume storage node Q stores 
data “0”, QB stores data “1”. In a write operation, first drive the data to the write 
bitline and make read wordline is not asserted so that transistor N5 remains switched 
off during the write operation by providing a virtual ground. The word wordline is 
then set to high to turn on both access transistors N3 and N4 which are connected to 
the word bitlines and thus data can be forced onto storage node Q and QB through the 
34 
 
two access transistors. Since in the conventional 6T SRAM cell, data may get flipped 
due to the strong storage inverter, therefore we use transistor N5 which is turned off 
during the write operation to weaken the cell storage and disable the regeneration of 
data in the normal feedback mechanism, results in improved write ability and speed.  
 
The cell drive current that flows during the write operation and write power are also 
reduced. This is because the floating ground provided by transistor N5 make the drive 
transistors (N1,N2) and access transistors (N3,N4) in series, which will result in lower 
cell current and power consumption.  
 
Read Operation: 
Data read out from this proposed SRAM Cell can be implemented by a separate read 
bitline RB. There is no need to precharge RB before the read operation which can 
save power during the precharge period and reduce the complexity of precharge 
structure in a large memory cell array. During the read operation, the write wordline is 
disabled and read wordline RWL rises from low to high in order to turn on transistor 
N6. Transistor N5 is also switched on to hold a strong “0” or “1” stored without any 
disturbance during the read operation. If node QB stores “1”, since NMOS transistor 
N6 is not perfect in passing “1” which results in the source voltage of transistor N4 to  
below Vdd, therefore, the gate voltage of transistor N7 is decreased and hence 
reducing the gate leakage. The transistor N7 should be designed with low threshold 
voltage at the sub-threshold operation. Therefore, read bitline RB is discharged to 
Gnd through transistor N7 and data “0” can be read out. Alternatively, if node Q 
stores “0”, since NMOS transistor N6 is good in passing “0”, RB get charged to Vdd 
by transistor P3 and data “1” can be read out. Therefore, the separate data retention 
and data output structures implemented in this SRAM Cell provide no disturbance 
during the cell read operation and hence improve the cell read stability.  
 
The proper transistor size in this proposed 10T SRAM design is crucial as they will 
significantly affect the performance and functionality of the cell. If the size has been 
overestimated, then the valuable silicon material will be wasted, the leakage will be 
increased, and the switching power dissipation will be worse. Vice versa, if the size 
has been underestimated, then the speed for either write or read operation would be 
really delayed due to the growing resistance to ground. Since the role of transistor N5 
is only to weaken the cross coupled inverters, thus it can be designed with a minimum 
size. Two pass transistors N3 and N4 should be strengthen with the minimum sizing 
storage inverters in order to increase the pull-up ratio and thus improve the write 
ability and speed. Since the need for lower threshold voltage in transistor N6 
primarily depends on the gate oxide thickness. Therefore, the read-port transistors 
should be provided with minimum dimensions to ensure low resistive path to read 
current, as well as reduce the cell area overhead.  
 
35 
 
Since this proposed cell design is implemented by separate read and write ports, it 
allows the use of a write assist transistor N5 to improve the write ability and speed 
with lower power consumption during the write operation. Another design feature 
enables the cell to obtain leakage power reduction in the read operation by using low 
threshold NMOS transistor N6. As a consequence, this proposed cell design can 
achieve both read and write power savings, as well as speed and stability separately 
improved.  
 
4.2.2 Write Driver Design 
The SRAM Write Driver is used to rapidly discharge one of the bitlines from the 
percharge level to ground. Normally, the write driver is activated by asserting a write 
enable signal and fully discharge the bitlines from the precharge level to gnd. In this 
SRAM design, we use one of the typical write driver circuits, as shown in Figure 4.3. 
 
 
 
Figure 4.3: Write Driver Circuit Schematic 
 
The write driver presented in this SRAM design consists of a pair of transistors on 
each write bitline for the data and the write enable signal W. The sources of both N1 
and N2 are connected to gnd. The input data will turn on one of the transistors N1 or 
N2. When write signal W is enabled, transistors N3 and N4 are both kept on, therefore, 
one of the write bitlines will get discharged from its precharge level to gnd. For 
example, if input data is “0”, then N1 is turned on and WB is discharged to gnd 
through transistors N1 and N4. Therefore, data “0” has been applied to WB.  
 
For large SRAM cell array, only one write driver is implemented for each SRAM 
column, presented in Figure 4.4. Thus, all the SRAM Cell in one column shares one 
write driver and the entire space of the write drivers is nothing to do with the total 
amount of the cells in the column and the size could be larger if it is needed.

4.2.3 Row decoder Design 
The speed of the row decoder has a great impact on memory performance. The 
decoder asserts the word lines based on the input addresses, it is designed to drive the 
capacitance of the word lines of the word lines and have high power efficiency. There 
is only one driver is active at each R/W operation to make the SRAM cells connected 
to the corresponding word line accessible. For most of the decoder structures, there 
will be an initial pre-decoder stage, a process which used to decode the group of 
address inputs to give the pre-decoder outputs. These will be then combined to the 
next stage either of decoders or the wordlines. 
 
Assume that a SRAM chip has 8 row addresses A0 to A7, thus, an 8-256 row decoder 
is realized by using two stages implementation to improve the speed and area 
performance, as shown in Figure 4.5. RD and WR are presented as inputs due to the 
decoupled read and write operation structure in the proposed SRAM Cell.  
 
 
37 
 
 
 
Figure 4.5: Row decoder structure 
 
Although multi-stage SRAM row decoder is quite popular used in large memory cell, 
for small single block memory, a single-stage row decoder is introduced. The 
performance related to the delay and power consumption of single-stage decoder can 
be greatly optimized by applying fast and low power basic gates. Figure 4.6 illustrates 
the various common used gates configurations. 
 
  
 
 
38 
 
Figure 4.6: Different 3 Input Basic Gates: a) CMOS Nand, b) Dynamic Nand, c) 
Skewed Nand, d) CMOS Nor, e) Dynamic Nor, f) Skewed Nor. [41] 
 
The simulation results of all gates configurations based on HSPICE software can be 
shown in Figure 4.7. It could be observed that the Dynamic Nands with shared NMOS 
and PMOS transistors have the least power consumption as they are part from the 
direct VDD/GND path all the time, therefore, it is more desirable in single block 
SRAM decoder design in order to improve the speed and power consumption. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.7: Performances of decoder with various gates configurations [41] 
 
4.2.4 Column multiplexer design 
The column multiplexer is formed by the pass gates that allows the data to be written 
into the memory cell or be passed onto the sense amplifier. The circuitry of the 
column multiplexer could either be wide enough when less resistance is required or 
small enough to fit the size of the memory cell. Furthermore, the PMOS transistors for 
the circuits will be used during the data read operation while the NMOS transistors 
will be used during the date write operation. This set of transistors will be applied to 
every column multiplexer for each column of bitlines.  
 
39 
 
In the column multiplexer design, signals could be either generated by a column 
multiplexers’ tree decoder or a separate column decoder. As shown in Figure 4.8(a), 
signals are generated from the tree decoder, the column address lines enable the pass 
transistors to let the data being routed through. However, both read and write 
operations are slightly delayed due to the series pass transistors. Therefore, the 
increased propagation delay will result in slow usage for large tree-based column 
multiplexer.  
 
 
Figure 4.8(a): Tree decoder column multiplexer [44] 
 
 
Figure 4.8(b): Column multiplexer with separate decoder [44] 
 
Figure 4.8(b) shows a column multiplexer based separate column decoder. The 
multiplexer is faster due to there is only one series transistor for the data from bitline 
to pass thorough. The column decoding is represented in parallel with row decoding 
which is better than the previous one (tree decoder) as this does not affect delay. 
It is easier to employ column multiplexing technique to lay out the sense amplifier 
since it can expand the bit pitch of each column, and multiple columns are enabled for 
the remainder of column circuitry after multiplexing. In addition, the number of 
power-hungry amplifiers required in the array can be reduced by placing sense 
amplifiers after the column multiplexers. 
 
40 
 
4.2.5 Sense Amplifier Design 
Since the memory cells are too weak to discharge the bitlines fast enough, thus the 
sense amplifier is used to amplify the data of bitlines during the read operation. The 
bitlines will continue to slew which will lead significant power dissipation due to the 
large capacitances of the bitlines unless a large differential bitlines is formed between 
them. So the amount of charge pulled down by the bitlines and the power dissipation 
could be controlled by limiting the word line pulse width. 
 
For example, the word line pulse width could be maintained to be wide enough for a 
differential voltage by using external structures like replica bitlines, then the sense 
amplifiers can read the data reliably.  
 
Figure 4.9 indicates the two different kinds of sense amplifiers: linear amplifier 
Figure 4.9(a) and latch amplifier Figure 4.9(b). The linear amplifier only consumes 
biasing power and works under limited supply voltage, these advantages made the 
linear amplifier are more preferred when the design requires low power and low 
supply voltage levels.  
 
The latch type sense amplifier consumes the least amount of power. There are two 
cross coupled gain stages of the sense amplifier and are enabled by the sense clock 
signal. The negative points of latch sense amplifier is that they might be slower due to 
some timing margin is necessary for the generation of the sense clock signal. 
However the sense amplifier could lead to an incorrect output while it is enabled 
before the differential voltage is formed. 
 
               
(a) Typical Linear Type Sense Amplifier         (b) Typical Latch Type Sense 
Amplifier 
    
Figure 4.9: Sense Amplifiers [41] 
 
Since the proposed SRAM Cell has separate read and write bitlines, the sense 
amplifier used in this cell is designed with a static inverter-type read buffer, as shown 
in Figure 4.10.  
 
41 
 
 
 
Figure 4.10: Read buffer schemes for sensing [40] 
 
The virtual ground VGND shown in Figure 4.10(a) can be achieved from a dummy 
column by Replica Technique. It is used to provide lower level than the ground level, 
thus the trip point of the read buffer can be successfully fixed to the middle of the 
RBL’s high and low levels to improve the sensing margin compared to the 
conventional read buffer with zero ground level, shown in Figure 4.10(b). 
 
4.2.6 Bitline conditioning circuits design 
The bitline conditioning circuitry is designed to precharge the bitlines to high prior to 
read and write operations. Three different schemes shown in Figure 4.11: (a) a simple 
bitline conditioner with a pair of PMOS transistors;?b?a weak pull-up transistor based 
pseudo-NMOS SRAMs where on clock is available;(c)To precharge through NMOS 
transistors, this technique improve the speed of single-ended bitline sensing as it helps 
to reduce the swing on the bitlines. On the other hand, this method decreases the noise 
margins and need more precharge time. 
 
                
 
Figure 4.11: Bitline conditioning circuits [41] 
 
 
 
 
 
 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.12: Precharge circuit in the proposed SRAM cell 
 
The precharge circuit used in this SRAM design is presented in Figrue 4.12. It uses 
two PMOS transistors P1 and P2 to drive the bitlines WB and WBB to the precharge 
level Vdd, since PMOS transistor operates faster than NMOS transistor which can 
reduce the precharge times. During the precharge operation, the enabled signal PC is 
set to high which can turn on the two drive PMOS transistors P1 and P2, thus WB and 
WBB will be precharged to Vdd. Since the size of the two PMOS transistors relates to 
the recovery speed of the cell, especially critical for the situation that the bitline is 
discharged after a write operation, thus proper size of the two PMOS transistors 
should be determined. 
 
 
4.2.7 Address Transition Detector (ATD) design 
In an asynchronous SRAM a read or a write operation is initiated by an address 
change or chip enable signal, whereas in synchronous SRAMs a read or write 
operation is initiated by the system’s master clock. The terms asynchronous and 
synchronous relate to the memory-system interface rather than to internal chip 
operation.  
 
Since the SRAM designed in this thesis project is an asynchronous SRAM. Therefore 
there will be no external clock signal to generate the read or write control sequences. 
All the control sequences must come from the signal transient of the input addresses 
and the read or write enable signals. A typical address transition detector is shown in 
Figure 4.13, which is desirable to be used in this SRAM design.  
 
 
 
 
 
43 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.13: Typical Address Transition Detector Circuit 
 
This address transition detector circuit is implemented as a wide-XOR gate 
comprising a set of delay circuits as shown in Figure. Every transition of address bus 
A0- A 1?n  produces a pulse on the output, which initiates a read or a write operation. 
During the write operation, when write signal W is enabled, if A0 jumps from “1” to 
“0”, the output of the XOR gate with A0 and delayed A0 inputs will generate a 
positive pulse. This pulse will turn on one of the NMOS transistors and consequently 
a negative pulse will be generated at the output of the buffer. The transient waveform 
can be found in Figure, in which a small PMOS transistor with gate shorted to ground 
is used as a pseudo resistor. It keeps the output of ATD high while there is no address 
transition.  
 
The key component in ATD is the delay circuits which generate a proper delay time 
of the input addressed. There are two main ways to design a delay component in a 
circuit, including RC delay circuits and inverter chains. In this design, the delay 
circuit is made of inverter chain with irregular transistor sizing, shown in Figure 4.14 
 
 
 
Figure 4.14: Inverter chain based delay circuit 
 
It can generate an approximately 25 ns reading pulse at 0.3 V supply voltage. The 
small first stage inverter will drive the relatively large second stage inverter (25 times 
of the first stage inverter). The second inverter can be viewed as a large capacitor due 
44 
 
to its large gate area. The third and fourth stages are used as buffers to obtain steeper 
signal transient edges. 
 
4.2.8  Input/Output Buffer Design 
Since we want to use bi-directional data bus, the data buffer should be designed 
carefully. It should latch the data in the buffer during read operation and be switched 
off during write operation. In addition, the buffer should have enough drive capacity 
to obtain a reasonable speed at lower supply voltages. This concern of sub-threshold 
drive capacity imposes an additional requirement for this data buffer design. The data 
buffer used in this SRAM design is shown in Figure 4.15. 
 
 
 
Figure 4.15: Bidirectional data bus 
 
During read operation, W is low, the buffers driving the bitlines WB and WBB are 
disabled, therefore they can be pre-charged to Vdd. When the sense amplifier is 
enabled and data is sensed, data will be locked in latch and drive the I/O pin through a 
buffer. This buffer is used to drive the I/O pad’s large capacitance (often several 
pico-farads) and reshape the output data signal. 
 
 
4.2.9  SEUs Detect SRAM Model based on BICS technique 
Since it has been discussed before, SEUs will occur in SRAM Cell under both 
standby and operating conditions which will significantly affect the performance and 
functionality of the cell. The traditional BICS can only detect the soft errors in SRAM 
under standby condition, therefore, an advanced BICS, proposed by N.M Sivamangai 
in 2010[34], is implemented in the proposed SRAM Cell which is able to detect soft 
errors at both standby and operating conditions, shown in Figure 4.16. 
 
45 
 
 
 
Figure 4.16: Advanced BICS SRAM design 
 
This more advanced structure consists of two comparators and one asynchronous 
latch. The comparator comprises one current mirror and one current source load 
inverter. The Svdd part is formed by transistors T1 to T8, where T1, T2 is used as 
current mirror and T7, T8 is used as current source load inverter. The current mirror 
has two source transistors T5, T6. Transistors T3, T4 and T8 provide the source 
current for both current mirror and inverter. All these three transistors are biased 
according to the reference voltage Bv. It is used to compare the voltage drop on line 
vddi to monitor 1 to 0 change by applying the three reference voltages to Bv. 
Similarly, another compartator Sgnd is formed by M1 to M8 with the reference 
voltage Bg. It is designed to monitor the voltage on line gndi to monitor 0 to 1 
flip.The signals Bypassvdd and Bypassgnd are presented to provide vddi and gndi to 
the memory column of SRAM array under read and write operation of the memory.  
 
The feature in this advanced BICS design is the additional logic circuitry with delay 
element being employed to enable the BICS operation under operating process. The 
reset control circuit is formed with one delay element and the transistors Rp1, Rp2, 
Rn1, Rn2 and Rn3 as shown in figure 8. The write wordline WWL is acted as the 
input to the delay element and read wordline RWL is connected to the gate of the 
transistor R3. The WWL will be delayed by the delay element when it is enabled 
under write condition. Buffer can be used as the delay element in order to generate the 
expected delay. The required delay could be 8.5 ns if the write time is assumed to be 
10 ns, then the required delay can be generated by the buffer in such a way that the 
reset signal being activated for first 8.5 ns under write access. After that, the delayed 
signal is transferred to the transistor Rp2, Rn2 and the WWL will be transfer to Rp1, 
Rn1.  
 
46 
 
During SRAM Cell standby condition, WWL is not enabled which turns on transistor 
Rp1, therefore node a is discharged. Reset signal goes to low which makes the BICS 
work, and error signal will be generated if any soft error occurs in the cell. During the 
SRAM Cell read operation, WWL and RWL signals are both set to high, thus 
transistor R3 is kept on. Node a is get discharged and reset signal remains at logic 0, 
so the BICS is able to generate error signal under read operation. 
 
In a SRAM Cell write operation, WWL is enabled and RWL is disabled, the delay 
output will keeps at logic 0 for the first 8.5ns, switching on transistors Rp2 and Rn1 to 
charge node a to Vdd. Therefore, reset signal goes high and the BICS will be disabled 
during the first 8.5ns. After that, WWL signal becomes high for the last 1.5ns and 
node a is discharged forcing the reset signal low. Therefore, it allows the BICS to 
operate at the end of write operation.  
 
The transient current pulse will be generated at the struck node when a particle hit the 
drain of the OFF NMOS transistor. The current flowing from Vdd to the struck node 
through the ON PMOS transistor forces the current flowing through either T1 or T2 
get reduced. This will lead the rise of voltage drop from the drain to source of the 
transistor T2. According to the connection between the drain of the transistor T2 and 
the gate of the transistor T7, the gate to source voltage of T7 will be raised. Thus a 
voltage pulse at the drain of T7 is generated due to the increase of the gate to source 
voltage. The transistors T9 and T10 is designed to amplify and reverse this voltage to 
make full logic value at node Ev. Similarly if the particle hits at the drain of the OFF 
PMOS transistor of the cell then the voltage drop will be generated by Sgnd at node 
Eg. Since the outputs Ev and Eg perform as inputs to the asynchronous latch, the latch 
will be activated to generated the error signal (Error) high when any of the two 
outputs goes high. 
 
In conclusion, this advanced BICS design is able to detect SEUs in the SRAM Cell 
happened at any instant of time at both standby and operating conditions due to the 
delay block and generated reset signal. As a consequence, the BICS technique is quite 
an effective way to detect fault tolerance in SRAM Cell design under radiation 
environment. 
 
In this chapter, an overview of the main SRAM blocks is presented. A 10T SRAM 
Cell is proposed, and the cell performance and stability are improved compared to the 
conventional 6T SRAM Cell. We also discussed the several types of write drivers, 
row decoder and column multiplexer strategies, sense amplifier design, Input/Output 
buffer design and address transition detector used in asynchronous SRAMs. Some of 
the discussed circuit techniques have been implemented in this proposed SRAM 
design. Advanced BICS technique used in this SRAM design can effectively detect 
the SEUs occurred at any instant of time at both standby and operating conditions. 
The following chapter will test this proposed SRAM cell performance and Cell self –
SEUs-detect ability.

Chapter 5: SRAM Cell Design Simulation 
5.1 Simulation techniques 
5.1.1 Monte Carlo method 
Monte Carlo simulation is a method that usually used in complex systems to evaluate 
a selected model through a couple of random parameters. In this thesis project, with 
the need to evaluate the impacts of process variation in SRAM Cell, Monte Carlo 
simulation using statistical models is required. The flow chart of this method is shown 
in Figure 5.1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.1: Monte Carlo method flow chart 
 
 
 
The first step for this approach is to choose a specific cell module under simulation. 
The next step is to select the parameters inside the model and each parameter is 
randomly sampled using a certain specified probability distribution. And the third step 
is to perform cell model simulation once and check the design parameter response. 
Repeat step 2 and 3, and finally aggregate the response of each computation into the 
final results.

5.1.2 Gaussian distribution 
Since the design parameter used in Monte-Carlo analysis are randomly generated 
from probability distribution, a proper distribution should be chosen for the 
parameters that can most closely models the random variation.  
 
In this project, the Monte-Carlo analysis in circuit design will use Gaussian 
distribution for each design parameter to characterize the process variation (the Vth 
fluctuations of each transistor, etc.). This leads to the design parameter will be varied 
around the average of the distribution. The Gaussian function can be expressed as 
follows and its characterization bell curve is shown in Figure 5.2.

From Figure 5.2: it can be seen that the shape of Gaussian Function is varied around 
the peak at the mean. In statistics, the three-sigma rule used for standard normal 
distribution operation, that can include almost all values plotted within 3 normal 
deviation around the mean, as shown in Figure 5.3.

In this project, the design parameter variations inside the SRAM Cell will be 
generated by Gaussian normal distribution within 3 standard deviation of the mean 
?? 3? to estimate the effect of process variations on the cell.  
 
5.2 Simulation Setup and Environment 
 
Different SRAM Cell circuits designed with the minimum transistor size will be 
simulated by HSPICE and MATLAB simulation tools. The CMOS transistors SPICE 
models used for the simulation are gained from the Predictive Technology Model 
(PTM) [45] website in different nano-technologies.  
 
Variable Parameters inside this cell are set to be threshold voltage (Vth), channel 
width (W), channel length (L), gate oxide thickness (tox) and supply voltage (Vdd). 
All variable parameters are being applied with 10% variation with a deviation of 3? 
unless particularly specified and assumed to be independents of each other. 
Simulation temperature is held at 25 Co , thus temperature variations will not be 
discussed in this paper and design parameter response ( power, write/read time, etc.) 
will be analyzed.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
50 
 
5.3 SRAM Cell Function Test 
 
The proposed SRAM Cell is simulated by using HSPICE and MATLAB tools under 
various different CMOS technology. Simulated results are compared with the existing 
6T, 7T, 8T, 10T SRAM Cells. Monte Carlo analysis will be employed to examine the 
impact of process variation on the power, stability, read and write time of the different 
individual SRAM cell. 
 
5.3.1 Write and Read operation test in Proposed SRAM Cell 
65nm CMOS Technology 
Cell Model: Proposed 10T SRAM Cell  
Simulation type: HSPICE simulation transient analysis 
Simulation time: 0 to 1000ns 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.4: Propose 10T SRAM Cell operation waveform 
 
 
Figure 5.4: Proposed 10T SRAM Cell operation waveform 
 
The transient waveforms of our proposed 10T SRAM Cell during the read and write 
operation in 65nm CMOS technology is shown in Figure 5.4. During write “0” 
operation, when write word line WWL is enabled, the state of Q and QB changes to 
“0” and “1” respectively, which can indicate that the write operation is working 
properly as the content of the memory has been updated. Ideally, after the write 
operation, the logical values on WB and WBB should matches with Q and QB 
respectively. The mismatch existed in this experiment is caused by dynamic energy 
51 
 
consumption in charging and discharging write bitlines. In the reading “1” cycle, 
when the read wordline RWL is asserted, the data“1”can be read out from read bitline 
RB. The writing “1” and reading “0” work similarly to the writing “0” and reading “1” 
operations. Therefore, data can be successfully written into this proposed cell when 
WWL is enabled and also can be read out from the read bitlines RB when RWL is 
asserted.   
 
In Figure 5.4, during the write operation, only a small swing of bitlines occurred in 
our proposed SRAM Cell instead of full swing bitlines in the conventional 6T SRAM 
Cell. Therefore, very small voltage swings on bitlines will lead to a significant 
reduction of the active power in the SRAM Cell as we expected, because the active 
power is mainly consumed by charging and discharging of the highly capacitive 
bitlines.  
 
5.3.2   Power and delay comparison for different cells 
45nm CMOS Technology 
Cell Model: 6T, 7T, 8T, 10T and Proposed SRAM Cells 
Simulation type: HSPICE simulation transient analysis 
Simulation time: 0 to 1000ns 
 
Figure 5.5 shows the comparison of average power consumption, read and write time 
in the case of 6T, 7T, 8T, 10T and proposed SRAM Cells. The read time is calculated 
when the read wordline RWL rises to half Vdd, to a time when the output voltage of 
read bitline RB is reached to half Vdd. Similarly, write time is the amount of time that 
taken to change the output of either Q or QB to half Vdd when write wordline WWL 
rises to half Vdd. Our proposed SRAM Cell achieves about 80% power savings 
compared to the conventional 6T SRAM Cell. This power reduction is primarily 
caused by the small swing bitline scheme using a tail transistor N5 to provide a high 
resistive path to the current flow and decrease the leakage during the write operation. 
 
 
Figure 5.5: Average power & read and write time in different SRAM Cells 
52 
 
The read time of our proposed SRAM Cell is 40% higher compared to the 6T SRAM 
Cell because of the low cell read current that causes longer time to discharge the read 
bitline, while the write time is 17% accelerated due to the extra tail transistor N5 
connected to the pull down transistors which will weaken the storage inverters in the 
cell. The write time can be improved if increasing the power supply on write wordline 
WWL or enlarging the size of transistor N5. 
 
5.3.3  SNM measure in different SRAM Cells 
45nm CMOS Technology 
Cell Model: Conventional 6T SRAM Cell, Proposed SRAM Cell 
Simulation type: HSPICE simulation DC analysis 
Simulation time: 0 to 1000ns 
 
Static noise margin (SNM) is often used as a metric to evaluate the stability. In order 
to calculate the SNM of the SRAM Cell, butterfly approach is implemented.  
Figure 5.6 illustrates the butterfly curves of both conventional 6T and proposed 10T 
SRAM Cells with no variability. Conventional 6T SRAM Cell provides a SNM of 
0.095 for a 0.7V power supply whereas the proposed cell achieves a SNM of 0.246 
for the same supply voltage, provides 158% read stability improvement. Thus, a big 
tolerance can be indicated to compare with the read failures for the advanced design 
as the storage nodes Q and QB are difficult to be disturbed under a read process. 
 
 
 
Figure 5.6: SNM in 6T and Proposed SRAM Cells  
 
 
This SNM enhancement in the proposed SRAM Cell results in increasing the expense 
due to the additional transistors compared to the conventional 6T SRAM Cell. 
53 
 
However, the device variation will cause further reduction of SNM in the 
conventional 6T SRAM Cell which can be compensated by increasing the cell ratio to 
enhance the read SNM and thus significantly increase the cell area, whereas the 
proposed SRAM Cell can provide a significant SNM enhancement without any 
transistor size changing.  
 
 
 
Figure 5.7: SNM against supply voltages in different CR 
 
Figure 5.7 shows that increase the cell ratio CR will provide a great SNM 
improvement in both conventional 6T SRAM Cell and proposed 10T SRAM Cell 
owing to the liner relation between sizing of the transistor and transistor drive current. 
However, when lowering the supply voltage, increasing the CR would not be an 
effective method to provide large SNM for future technologies. Because of there is a 
linear relation between the transistor drive current and the sizing, which just as 
opposed to a quadratic or exponential dependence on supply voltage. SNM is reduced 
at a ultra-low power supply, thus, the use of sizing transistor in SRAM design 
becomes less effective.  
 
 
5.3.4  SRAM Cell performance testing under process variation 
i) SRAM Cell simulation results under Vth variation 
45nm CMOS Technology 
Cell Model: Conventional 6T SRAM and Proposed 10T SRAM Cells 
Variable Parameter: Threshold Voltage Vth with a deviation of 3? variations 
Simulation Type: HSPICE simulation DC analysis, sweep monte = 100 
Simulation time: 0 to 1000ns 
 
 
54 
 
In order to investigate the process variation effect on the SRAM Cell, 10% variation 
is applied in threshold voltage Vth with 3? deviation, acted as an independent 
random variable for all the transistors inside SRAM cell with a Gaussian distribution. 
From Figure 5.8, it can be observed that the read SNM of both conventional 6T and 
proposed 10T SRAM Cell is degraded compared to the normal SNMs in Figure owing 
to the Vth variation. The read SNM of conventional 6T SRAM Cell is reduced up to 
45%, whereas in the proposed design approximately 15% SNM reduction, so 
conventional 6T SRAM cell is more susceptible to process variation.  
 
Therefore, the 10% Vth variation to the transistors results in small box inside the 
conventional 6T SRAM cell butterfly curves. Whereas for the proposed SRAM cell, 
the same Vth variations lead to small effect on read SNM which can be tolerated by 
the cell. In addition, the proposed 10T SRAM Cell also can achieve 2.6 times higher 
read SNM as compared to the conventional 6T SRAM cell under the same Vth 
variation. Thus, the proposed 6T SRAM cell provides better read stability and is 
process variation tolerant. 
 
Figure 5.8: Read SNM under Vth variation in different cells  
 
 
Figure 5.9: Write Ability under Vth variation in the conventional 6T SRAM Cell 
55 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.10: Write Ability under Vth variation in the proposed 10T SRAM Cell  
 
Since the 6T SRAM Cell can not function well at a lower supply voltage due to the 
insufficient noise margin, thus in order to evaluate the write ability under the process 
variation of both conventional 6T and proposed SRAM Cells, Monte Carlo simulation 
with 10% Vth variation is applied to both the cells using PTM-45nm models at a 
supply voltage of 0.4V. As it can be observed in Figure 5.9 and Figure 5.10, the Vth 
variation in the 6T SRAM Cell causes the write failures as the data on storage node Q 
and QB in some cases has reached the same level, which violates the principle of the 
write operation. Whereas in the proposed cell, it can achieve a stronger write ability 
although the data on node Q and QB slightly varied during the write operation which 
is caused by the Vth variation.  
 
ii) SRAM Cell simulation results under supply voltage variation 
Different CMOS techniques 
Cell Model: Proposed 10T SRAM Cell 
Variable Parameter: Supply voltage Vdd 
Simulation Type: HSPICE simulation transient analysis and dc analysis 
Simulation time: 0 to 1000ns 
 
Lower supply voltage is considered to be one of the most effective way to reduce the 
power consumption in the SRAM cell design in order to pursue ultra-low power 
operation. Thus, to carry out a comparative analysis of the power in various SRAM 
Cells, we uses the PTM-45nm device models for all the cell designs. Figure 5.11 
illustrates the simulated power consumption under different supply voltage in various 
SRAM cells. When lowering the supply voltage from 1.4V to 0.4V, the average power 
consumption in all SRAM cells are significantly reduced and the proposed 10T 
SRAM cell always achieves the lowest power dissipation at different supply voltage 
56 
 
due to the floating ground that leads to the cell current reduction and the single ended 
read circuitry used to allow no precharge for the read bitline.  
 
Figure 5.11: Power Consumption in various SRAM cells under Vdd variation 
 
 
Figure 5.12: Read SNM in proposed SRAM Cell under Vdd variation 
 
Figure 5.12 shows the simulation results the variation of the "butterfly" curves in the 
proposed SRAM cell at different supply voltage Vdd. We can observe that a 
significant degradation in SNM during the read operation when Vdd is reduced from 
1.0V to 0.5V. Therefore, lower the supply voltage will further aggravate the effect on 
SNM and cause the circuit more susceptible to soft errors. 
 
Lower supply voltage will also increase both read and write time in CMOS nano-scale 
technologies, as shown in Figure 5.13 and Figure 5.14. The proposed 10T SRAM cell 
is simulated at different CMOS technologies in order to evaluate the impact of the 
CMOS technology scaling on cell’s read and write time. It can be observed that when 
using PMT-32nm device models, the write time of proposed SRAM Cell achieves 
highest value but its read time is lowest under Vdd Variation compared to other 
technologies. Thus, the read and write time can not be optimized simultaneously by 
57 
 
CMOS technology scaling down, which requires the designer to strike a good balance 
between read and write time. However, either of the read and write time can be 
compensated by enlarging the size of read or write access transistor.  
 
Figure 5.13: Proposed SRAM cell read time measure under Vdd variation 
 
Figure 5.14: Proposed SRAM cell write time measure under Vdd variation 
 
Figure 5.15 shows the write time plot for different SRAM Cells under supply voltage 
Vdd variation. When lowering the supply voltage from 0.6V to 0.4V, we can see a 
significant increase in read and write time for both conventional 6T and proposed 
SRAM cell.

58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.16: Read time measure under Vdd variation in different SRAM Cells 
 
The proposed SRAM cell provides approximately 27% write time reduction at a 
supply voltage of 0.4V compared to the conventional 6T SRAM cell. Similar write 
time enhancement can be also observed at other low voltages supplied. 
 
As mentioned before, the write time improvement in the proposed 10T SRAM cell is 
due to the weakening of the storage inverters in the cell by switching off the write 
transistor N5 to provide a floating ground terminal of the storage inverters. Since a 
single read transistor N6 in the proposed SRAM cell is implemented for an entire 
world line during the read access, the low cell current makes the cell take longer time 
to discharge the read bitline RB and thus increase the read time of the proposed cell 
compared to the conventional 6T SRAM cell, as shown in Figure 5.16. One read time 
enhancement approach is to size the read transistor in order to increase the read bitline 
discharge speed, but it will also increase the area overhead. 
 
iii) SRAM Cell Simulation Results under device parameter variation 
45nm CMOS technique 
Cell Model: Conventional 6T and proposed 10T SRAM Cells 
Variable Parameter: Channel length L, channel width W, gate oxide thickness 
tox and threshold voltage Vth.  
Simulation Type: HSPICE simulation transient analysis, sweep monte=1000 
Simulation time: 0 to 1000ns 
 
In this experiment, the read & write time and power consumption of SRAM Cells 
owing to the process fluctuation in the channel length L, channel width W, gate oxide 
thickness tox and the threshold voltage Vth are evaluated. Each parameter is assumed 
to own a normal Gaussian statistical distribution with a 3? variation of 10% and all 
parameters vary simultaneously. Monte Carlo Simulations with 1000 randomized 
instances are applied to estimate the effect of process variation on read and write time 
of the proposed 10T and conventional 6T SRAM cells.  
 
59 
 
Figure 5.17 and Figure 5.18 show the Monte Carlo simulation results of power 
consumption under PTM-45nm device parameter variation. The mean power 
consumption of proposed SRAM cell is about 1.3 ? W, which is very close to the 
value of power in Figure 5.5 when the proposed SRAM cell is simulated with no 
parameter variability. Whereas, the mean power consumption in the conventional 6T 
SRAM cell reaches to about 8? W, which is 12% higher than the power (7.2? W) 
shown in Figure 5.5 when the 6T SRAM cell is in the normal operation with no 
parameter variability. In addition, it can be also observed that a 84% decrease in the 
mean power consumption of the proposed cell compared to the 6T cell. Thus, the 
proposed SRAM cell is less susceptible to device parameter variation compared to the 
conventional 6T SRAM cell and consumes less average power.  
 
Figure 5.17: power consumption distribution in the conventional 6T SRAM Cell 
 
Figure 5.18: power consumption distribution in the proposed 10T SRAM Cell 
 
Simulation results of read and write time distribution in both conventional 6T and 
proposed 10T SRAM Cells under PTM-45nm device parameter variation can be 
illustrated in Figure 5.19 and Figure 5.20. Compared to Figure 5.5, as it can be seen, 
the mean of read time in the proposed SRAM cell is approximately 3.6ns, which is 2.7% 
higher compared to the read time (3.5ns) of the same cell under no device parameter 
variation (Figure 5.5), while the mean read time (2.7ns) in the 6T SRAM cell achieves 
a 7.4% increase compared to the read time (2.5ns) without the device parameter 
variation (Figure 5.5). 
60 
 
 
Similarly, the mean of write time (3.6ns) in the proposed SRAM cell, which is 3.3% 
higher compared to the write time (3.5ns) of the same cell under no device parameter 
variation (Figure 5.5), while the mean write time (3.6ns) in the 6T SRAM cell 
achieves a 5.5% increase compared to the write time (3.4ns) without the device 
parameter variation (Figure 5.5). 
 
It can be concluded that the proposed 10T SRAM Cell is less susceptible to device 
parameter variation compared to 6T SRAM Cell. Even in the presence of 10% 
parameter variation, the proposed SRAM cell can still achieve 15% write time 
accelerated compared to 6T SRAM cell. Although both read and write time increase 
due to the mismatch between the transistors which is caused by the parameter 
variation, the two SRAM cells can still achieve high speed performance.

5.4 SRAM Cell Layout 
 
The layout of both conventional 6T and proposed 10T SRAM Cells design with 
minimum sized transistors are carried out in 0.70 ? m process by using Microwind 
Version 3.1, as shown in Figure 5.21 and Figure 5.22. The total size of proposed 10T 
SRAM layout is 42.5 m? ?33 m? , which is 48% area overhead compared to 
conventional 6T SRAM layout due to the four additional transistors and separate read 
wordline and bitline implementation in the proposed SRAM Cell.  
 
However, in practice, 6T SRAM Cell design needs to enlarge the size in transistors to 
compensate the conflict of read and write performance requirement. Whereas, in the 
proposed SRAM Cell, although it has higher area cost than 6T SRAM Cell, lower 
power consumption and high performance can be achieved during both read and write 
operation without sizing transistors, which results in no further area overhead.

Chapter 6: SRAM Cell SEUs Detection Test  
In order to test the proposed SRAM Cell susceptibility to the SEUs and analysis the 
propagation of radiation effect on the cell during the standby, read and write modes, 
the particle strikes is simulated by injecting a transient current pulse at the sensitive 
node Q. 
 
The current will be measured up to a point where it causes the data flip on storage 
node Q and QB. The current pulse that results from the particle strikes is expressed as 
follows: 
)()( rf
t
t

ee
tt
Q
tI
??
?
?
?  
Where Q is the amount of charge collected due to the ion strike, and 
ft  is the fall 
time and rt  is the rise time. 
 
To evaluate the BICS detection capability on SEUs, we choose 32nm CMOS 
technology for HSPICE simulation. According to the three different operation 
conditions (standby, write and read) in SRAM, the reference voltages Bv and Bg used 
in the BICS SRAM model should be determined. Table 6.1 shows the different 
reference voltages used in this experiment. 
 
Operation Mode 
Reference Voltage (V) 
Bv Bg 
Standby 0.5 0.7 
Write 0.4 0.8 
Read 0.6 0.5 
 
Table 6.1: BICS Reference Voltages 
 
Simulation results for SEUs under standby condition: 
 
Figure 6.1 illustrates the simulation results of the BICS Cell during standby mode. 
The current pulse itrans is generated with rt =5ps and ft =100ps. We can observe 
that the current is injected after the write wordline WWL is disabled and thus the 
BICS cell is idle. The data on node Q and QB get flipped when current pulse 
itrans=220uA is injected at 20ns and can be detected by BICS since the error signal 
goes high to indicate the occurrence of SEUs in this BICS cell. 
 
64 
 
 
 
Figure 6.1: SEUs detection in BICS during standby mode 
 
Simulation results for SEUs under operating condition: 
 
As described before, the data upset in the cell caused by the SEUs not only occur 
during the standby condition, but also existed during the cell operating condition, as 
shown in Figure 6.2. During the write operation, since the delay element is used in the 
cell to control the reset signal RST, thus the current pulse should be generated after 
RST becomes low to ensure it is injected at the end of the write operation. From 
Figure, it can be observed that the current pulse itrans=420u injected at 12ns results in 
1 to 0 data flip in the cell and thus error signal is generated. 
 
 
 
Figure 6.2: SEUs detection in BICS at the end of write operation 
 
During the read operation, as shown in Figure 6.3, when the current pulse 
itrans=140uA is injected at 30ns, after the read wordline RWL is enabled, the data 
also gets flipped (Q becomes 0 and QB becomes 1), thus error signal is generated due 
to the particle hits on the cell sensitive node QB. Therefore, our simulation results 
have shown that this BICS cell has obtained high detection sensitivity to SEUs, which 
can clearly indicate the occurrence of soft error at both standby and operating 
conditions.

Chapter 7: Conclusion  
The reduced SNM of SRAM when lowering the supply voltage imposes great 
challenges to the modern SRAM design. The conventional 6T SRAM cell cannot 
function well because it can not achieve enough noise margin due to the conflict of 
read and write operation requirements. In order to achieve low power operation, 
previous research work has demonstrated that the read and write decoupled scheme is 
a good approach to enhance the SNM. 
 
A robust 10T low power SRAM Cell is proposed and simulated in different CMOS 
nano-technologies in this paper, as described in chapter 4. The proposed cell is based 
on asymmetric cell topology and uses separate read and write circuitry to enhance 
read/write stability. The write speed/power is significantly enhanced by providing a 
floating ground during the write operation.  
 
In chapter 5, Monte Carlo simulations indicate a 158% read stability improvement, a 
17% write time accelerated and a 80% overall power saving in new cell compared to 
the conventional 6T SRAM Cell, which fits for ultra-low-power applications. This 
increase comes at the cost of additional transistors, wordline and bitline that have a 48% 
area overhead. The proposed cell architecture can provide high speed and significant 
read and write data stability, even in the presence of process variations and device 
parameter mismatch, by isolating the read path from the write path. The improved 
read and write ability, reduced power consumption and high speed compared to 6T 
SRAM cell makes this new approach attractive for nano-CMOS regime in low power 
applications when the process variation is considered as a major design constraint. 
 
In chapter 6, a single event upsets (SEUs) detection technique BICS is implemented 
in this SRAM design and evaluated through HSPICE simulations. Thus, it is capable 
to detect SEUs at any instant of time by generating an error signal to indicate the 
occurrence of soft errors, especially useful for real radiation environments for the 
applications such as space applications which require high-reliability.

Chapter 8: Future work 
Although a lot of work has been carried out in the concept of the low power SRAM 
design in nano-CMOS technology, a few extensions to this project still need to be 
studied. In this chapter, the discussion based on the existing work and future 
development will be presented. 
 
This project has presented a novel SRAM Cell design methodology for low power 
and high performance. With separate read and write circuitry implementation in this 
new cell, the static noise margin is enhanced as well as significant power savings 
compared to conventional 6T SRAM Cell. Some of the corresponding periphery 
circuit techniques have been discussed in this proposed SRAM design, such as write 
drivers, row decoder and column multiplexer, sense amplifier design, but we have not 
simulated their performance and evaluated the practicability. Thus, in the future, we 
intend not only to enhance the performance of the essential SRAM Cell design, but 
also to change our research motivation into these periphery circuit designs, to explore 
new and effective techniques for these applicants improvement  
 
The impact of temperature variation should be investigated in the future, as it may 
influence the circuit operating conditions and thus the performance. Since the 
nano-CMOS technologies scales down, it has been demonstrated that the process 
variations will greatly affect the performance of SRAMs and may create the 
functional failures in memory. More specifically, the other failure mechanisms, such 
as the data flipping hold failure need to be analyzed in the future. Different directions 
of failure with various falling condition also need to be studied. The SRAM reliability 
could be improved by developing the design of variation tolerant approach to decrease 
the effects of process induced variations. 
 
The single SRAM Cell implemented in this project is needed to apply to cell array 
inside the SRAM chip to enable large memory capacity to meet the modern 
commercial product requirements. The chip applicability and fabrication should be 
evaluated. 
 
During this project, both the impact of radiation effects on SRAMs and various soft 
errors decrease methods are discussed, in addition, a BICS-based SRAM has been 
introduced, which is used to detect the soft errors induced by the radiation. Design 
methodologies to offer the immunity to these particle strikes and soft errors needs to 
be studied in the future in order to implement radiation hardened memories.
