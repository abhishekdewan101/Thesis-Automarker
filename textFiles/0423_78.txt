Executive Summary
The aim of the project was to explain and predict global happiness. This was a cross
sectional study including 123 countries, each having a mean happiness value. This ground
truth was established from survey data, using the answer to a life satisfaction question. The
features used to predict happiness were collected from online sources, and were chosen using
background knowledge gained from a review of previous work.
Initial data analysis was performed to discover patterns in the data using PCA, visualisa-
tions and correlations. PCA found an interesting convex relationship between life satisfaction
and gender equality. The data was prepared firstly by imputing missing values with the k-
nearest neighbour method. Some variables were transformed using log where their relationship
with life satisfaction was found to be exponential.
Prior to performing feature selection life satisfaction prediction was assessed, comparing an
initial feature set with economic variables using a t-test of the correlations of cross validation
folds. The feature set was found to be as predictive as the economic variables. Feature
selection was performed using lasso, least squares and decision trees. The significance of
results was determined by finding test statistic thresholds using permutation testing and
bootstrapping. A key feature set was identified as:
Life expectancy Income distribution Proportion of women in parliament
Freedom Primary education enrolment Secondary education enrolment
Mortality rate
These features were used with several learners to construct models to predict happiness. Model
trees performed the best with a mean correlation of 0.86 across the cross validation folds. This
was not significantly more predictive than lasso (p = 0.52), indicating the relationship of the
key features with life satisfaction is highly linear. The key feature set was significantly more
predictive than using the larger original feature set (p = 2.12?10?16), highlighting the benefits
of feature selection. The performance of our key feature set was compared against economic
variables and gave a significantly better performance for both lasso and decision trees.
Bayes networks were used to assess the relationships of the variables using the following
measures of performance; percentage correct, ROC curve area and degrees of freedom. No
improvement in performance was found when connecting GDP per capita directly with life
satisfaction. This supports the notion that GDP allows other variables to occur which in turn
impact on life satisfaction, rather than GDP having a direct and significant impact.
Finally, Chernoff faces proved an effective visualisation method for our multivariate dataset.
This is an intuitive representation where happier faces correspond to higher life satisfaction,
and hence patterns and anomalies can be easily identified. An interactive visualisation of
results can be found at http://intelligentsystems.bristol.ac.uk/research/Millard/.
In summary, key highlights of this project are:
¥ PCA uncovered an interesting relationship between gender equality and life satisfaction
¥ Decision trees proved an effective method in both feature selection and life satisfaction
prediction
¥ Our key features performed significantly better than economic variables
¥ Graphical models helped investigate variable relationship structure
¥ An effective data visualisation method was used to demonstrate results
The work previously completed consists of a review of previous work and methods, which
contribute to sections 2 and 3 respectively. Also, initial survey data analysis was performed
to determine a ground truth of life satisfaction (contributing to section 4).

1 Introduction
1.1 Overview
Happiness economics is an active area of research. The aim of this work is to use a machine
learning approach, to explain and predict global happiness. At present countries mainly use GDP
to determine progress1 but this has come under increasing criticism as measuring Òeverything, in
short, except that which makes life worthwhileÓ. [Robert Kennedy, 1968]
We investigate a broad range of variables to discover more appropriate measures of progress,
that impact on happiness. A focus is given to variables over which we have control and can change
in order to improve quality of life, and those that governmental policy can directly affect such as
education and health. Environmental variables such as weather are also considered as these are
affected by issues such as climate change on which government policy has an impact. This leads
us to state our meaning of happiness for the purposes of this project. We define happiness as
synonymous with life satisfaction and corresponding to the longer term notion of the quality of
oneÕs life.
Figure 1.1 shows a happiness map generated in 2006 using various survey sources, and large
global variations of happiness are very apparent. Whilst a strong correlation between GDP and
happiness has been shown previously this is certainly not the whole picture, and other variables
are likely to play a key role; ÒEconomic factors are not goals in themselves but are means for
acquiring other types of social goalsÓ [25].

1.2 Methodology
Our contribution from a new perspective using machine learning techniques aims to provide a
new insight into this area. Previous research has used statistical methods predominantly linear
regression. Machine learning techniques will allow the application of powerful methods to the
dataset to find new patterns, such as decision trees and support vector machines, each having
different benefits.
1One exception is Bhutan, a small country in South Asia, which uses an alternative measure called Gross
National Happiness (GNH) to assess progress. This was established in 1972 by the fourth Dragon King, in order
to better reflect the important aspects of his peoples lives, centred on Buddhism and spirituality. [38] More
recently even the UK is considering alternative measures with David Cameron announcing in 2010 plans to measure
happiness; ÒI believe a new measure wont give us the full story of our nationÕs well-being ... but it could give us a
general picture of whether life is improvingÓ[11].

1.3 Report Structure
A review of previous work is given in section 2, followed by an overview of key statistical and
machine learning methods in section 3. Sections 4 - 11 are investigatory. A ground truth of
happiness is established in section 4 and the reliability of this measure is also investigated. Data
analysis is performed to uncover patterns, described in section 5.2. The predictive capabilities of
our initial feature set compared to economic variables is assessed in section 7. Feature selection
is performed in two stages (sections 8 and 9). Several methods are investigated to find the best
happiness prediction in section 10, and structural relationships are assessed in section 11. Finally,
our results are visualised using an effective representation (section 12).

2 Research Review
2.1 Measuring Happiness
Previously it was thought that you could not measure happiness but only behaviour.[31] However,
there have been independent strands of research which provide strong evidence to the contrary.
Biologically, it has been found that specific areas of the brain are active when a person experiences
happiness. An interesting piece of research ([30]) looked at brain activity with respect to the
emotions of happiness, sadness and disgust. They found correlations between these emotions with
activity in multiple regions of the brain, some of which were shared for the different emotions while
others were specific to the emotion and stimulus. The potential to assign a value of happiness
depending on brain activity highlights that happiness is a more tangible and measurable property
than once thought.
A pertinent issue is the contribution of the genome to ones happiness as this could significantly
affect results (the Ònature versus nurtureÓ debate). We are interested in the ÒnurtureÓ causes of
happiness from living in different countries. Research published in 1996 ([33]) looked at the degree
to which happiness may be encoded in our genes. They did this using data of a happiness survey
question but where the recipients were twins, both monozygotic and dizygotic. Monozygotic
twins have an identical genome, whereas dizygotic twins do not. 127 sets of twins were surveyed
twice, with a ten year gap. To investigate the degree to which genomes are responsible for
happiness the results were correlated within twins: (person1, survey1)? (person2, survey2) and
(person2, survey1) ? (person1, survey2). The results were significantly different for the twins
types, where monozygotic and dizygotic twins gave correlation of 0.4 and 0.07 respectively. The
twins with identical genomes had a much stronger correlations between happiness levels. They
conclude that happiness in adults is determined in equal measure by both genes and environmental
factors.
A more recent paper by Frey [23] aimed to find specific genes which code for happiness, using
longitudinal survey data and gene association. Gene association is the process of investigating the
correlation between a genesÕ expression and a particular trait (or phenotype). The gene 5HTT
was selected as the candidate gene as it is known to be involved in brain development and so may
have implications on happiness. They describe happiness as having a baseline which is specific to
each individual and encoded in their genes, and happiness fluctuates about this value in response
to their environment and experiences. This paper highlights the complexity of happiness, where
there is likely to be a complex combination of factors that contribute, including the cumulative
effect of multiple genes in addition to environmental factors.
A happiness coding gene however could potentially affect the results. The central considera-
tion for this is whether the global genetic distribution is clustered such that there would be an
uneven spread across the globe. This is however not thought to be the case, where there has been
sufficient human migration to give an even distribution. There may still be effects on results as
for instance, the existence of a baseline happiness may cause the variance of a countries happiness
to remain fairly constant but the mean may change, as peoples happiness alters with respect to
their own baseline values.
A final point of consideration is how well subjective happiness represents the happiness of a
person. Previous research compared the consistency of happiness measures given from different
sources. A 2009 study by Sandvik et al. ([45]) looked at the correlation between self-reported
happiness and the values given by family and friends. They found these three assessments of a
personsÕ happiness to be highly consistent.
This discussion has highlighted the complexity of this trait, but also shown happiness to
be less abstract and intangible than was previously thought. Establishing a ground truth for
happiness is an important aspect of this project, which must accurately represent our notion of
happiness. The following section investigates deriving a ground truth from the survey data.
3
2.2 Establishing a Ground Truth
A general consensus is that answers to survey questions provide representative values of happiness
or life satisfaction. The three main global surveys used in this type of research are the World
Value Survey (WVS), Gallup World Poll (GWP) and World Database of Happiness (WDH). A
typical question takes the form Òhow satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days?Ó
with an answer scale typically 0 - 10 [16]. The GWP is a large scale survey carried out on a
daily basis. However, the data is not freely available and we only have access to some limited
data through the results of another study2. The WDH is a compilation of happiness values from
different surveys, predominantly the WVS.
The ground truth we use can be either from a single source or a combined value of multiple
sources. The choice we make will be dependent on results of data analysis. Previous work
has tended to keep different happiness labels separate (choosing one or working with several
simultaneously) rather than fusing multiple sources. Using a single source however has short
comings due to the validity of each source. Firstly, the WDH is a secondary source, a compilation
of results from multiple survey sources. We prefer to use a primary source such that we have
a better knowledge of the survey data. Secondly, the different surveys vary with respect to the
countries studied and various details regarding the survey format. This means that one cannot
simply be preferred over the other. Therefore, we will begin with primary data and establish a
ground truth from these values (which may mean several alternative labels). Section 4 investigates
the available survey data and establishing a ground truth. Section 2.4.1 looks at conflicting results
of previous work, and possible causes from differences in surveys.
The Happy Planet Index ([3]) developed by The New Economics Foundation (NEF) is a global
measure indicating sustainable happiness, the happiness component of which came from the GWP
life satisfaction question. This work is of particular interest as data from multiple sources was
used to extend the dataset, using regression to infer a value for the GWP for additional countries.
112 countries came from Gallup, 16 from WVS and 14 from GWPÕs ladder of life question. This
method relies on countries with values for multiple surveys which means a relationship between
the survey values can be inferred. 68 countries had results for both GWP and WVS. Regression
was performed using GWP and WVS as the dependent and independent variables respectively,
such that GWP values are inferred from WVS values. [3]
Stepwise regression was used to improve the correlation between the survey datasets using
additional variables. This is a recursive regression where a variable is added at each step . If this
variable provides a significant improvement to the inference of the GWP value then it is kept,
otherwise it is ignored.
The use of stepwise regression improved correlation, where they found that Òfour variables
are able to predict 91% of the varianceÓ which included the Human Development Index and
an education index amongst others. It is interesting to assess the variables that improved the
correlation between the surveys, as they may indicate the differences between them. For instance
[16] noted that WVS tended to bias their surveying towards more intelligent people in certain
countries to make the sample Òmore comparableÓ. This may be consistent with the use of an
education variable here, showing that the variance between the surveys may be accounted for
to some degree by education levels. WVS has in effect controlled for education by reducing the
difference across countries.
Stepwise regression was also used to correlate the GWP life satisfaction data with the GWP
ladder of life data. This found different variables improved the correlation between the datasets
including life expectancy and geographical variables. [3] The ladder of life question asks the
respondent their life satisfaction relative to their attainable levels; ÒPlease imagine a ladder, with
steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the
best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you.
On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?Ó. This

highlights the affect of seemingly small differences in question format can have on the responses
given. [3]
The use of additional variables improved the correlation between surveys, and gave a larger
set of countries with GWP values. This method is appropriate where the overlap between the
surveys is large enough such that correlation can be accurately inferred. However, we suggest
some concerns of the validity of this. Firstly, the assumption of a linear correlation between
the two surveys. Secondly, the spread of data may affect the results, as it seems that the WVS
countries are much sparser in the lower range of the GWP data.
The use of additional variables is not appropriate for our project because our
happiness label is used to find a predictive feature set. Using additional variables
to derive the label would clearly bias the subsequent correlations. Hence we
would only be able to regress using solely survey data.
2.3 General Research
A 2004 paper by Gundelach et al. ([25]) is of particular interest for two reasons. Firstly, it
includes the use of graphical models to analyse the causal relationships. Secondly, a distinction
is made between life satisfaction and happiness, where they showed that these concepts are
actually two distinct labels, with different independent variables. Gundelach et al. are critical of
previous studies, where mostly life satisfaction and happiness are treated synonymously instead of
accounting for their differences in meaning. [25] shows that GDP and these labels have a Òrather
high but far from perfect correlationÓ [25], indicating there is certainly more to the determinants
of happiness than GDP alone.
The methods used seem distinct from other research in this area. Firstly, they discuss the
importance of looking at distribution of values not just the means. This is because the survey
answers are options over a range of values, usually between 0 and 10. Analysis has typically
focused on the mean values of each country.
A key difference between this research and our study is the choice of entity, where individual
respondents are used rather than countries. Variables always correspond to each individual entity,
and hence in this study come from the survey data together with each happiness value. It may be
useful to work with data corresponding to individual respondents rather than values for countries
as a whole, but this has the disadvantage that survey answers have additional uncertainty as
answers people give may not always be truthful or representative. The use of variables from
global datasets such as the World Bank removes this source of inaccuracy. Further to this, our
aim is to predict happiness without the need for surveys and hence using individual respondents
as entities would be inappropriate.
This work included using Òchain graphical modelsÓ, to produce a Markov graph (figure 2).
The graph contains edges where an edge between two variables means they are directly related
to each other. A Markov graph is one where each node is conditionally independent on all other
nodes give the nodes directly connected to it. To construct the graph it is initially constructed
by hand, where variables have no edge connecting them if it is certain there is no dependence
relationship between them. This therefore requires domain knowledge to reduce the number of
edges in this initial graph. The dependence relationships in this graph are then tested using log
linear analysis to test dependence, and if they are found to be independent the edge is removed.
This results in a graph showing the dependent relationships only.
This work found some interesting results and in particular, the resulting model (figure 2)
shows differences between the causality of life satisfaction and happiness respectively. Both
happiness and life satisfaction correlate with country (with correlation coefficients of 0.40 and
0.22), although this is stronger for happiness. Life satisfaction is found to correlate with Òlife
controlÓ whereas happiness correlated with Òstable relationshipÓ (these variables come from the
survey data also). Of particular note, income is not included in the model as it was not found
5
The main results of the analysis are as follows:
1. Perceived happiness and life satisfaction are highly correlated but
not identical. The relationships between the dependent and inde-
pendent variables differ, and this is evidence that they do not
belong to the same latent variable.
2. Perceived happiness and life satisfaction are both related to coun-
try of residence.
3. The main influences on perceived happiness are the country of resi-
dence and whether the respondent lives in a stable relationship.
4. The main influences on life satisfaction are the experience of life
controlÑthat is, the answer to Òhow much freedom and control the
respondent feels he or she has over the way life turns outÓÑand
country of residence.
It is equally interesting to look at some of the variables that did not
correlate with the three dependent variables. For instance, when
controlled for other variables, income is not related to perceived
happiness or life satisfaction. This is somewhat unexpected. Stud-
ies, for example, by Bradburn (1969) and Easterlin (1974) show
correlations between the individualÕs social status and self-rated
happiness. There may be several reasons for this discrepancy. One
explanation may be technical and owing to problems in comparing
self-reported income in different countries. To make comparisons

to correlate strongly (with a correlation above 0.16) with either life satisfaction or happiness.
However, Gundelach et al. expla n t is with the choice of sample whe e only European countries
were used and hence the variance of wealth may be fairly small. However, we question this as
since this study is on an individual basis it seems there would still be a fair amount of variance
of wealth within a population. This may therefore indicate that wealth is ot a key factor in
happiness or perhaps is evidence supporting the Easterlin Paradox (see section 2.4).
The differences in correlations for life satisfaction and happiness were attributed to the dif-
ferences in meaning of the two terms where Òhappiness is more emotional and life satisfaction is
more cognitiveÓ [25], which intuitively makes sense with regards to the particular correlates of
each.
We are not concerned with the semantic differences of these variables as we think
both contribute to our noti n of happiness f r this project, and consi er both
types of label.
This work ([25]) shows strong evidence for the fact that happiness is ot solely determined by
wealth. The use of just EU countries was an effective way of controlling for wealth such that other
correlations could be determined more easily. It should be noted however, that construction of
such graphical models do no determine the dir ction of cau ality, and in this sense the directed
graph produced in [25] (figure 2) is misleading.
Bayesian networks (see section 3.3.8) are an appropriate machine learning
approach as an alternative to this method of graph construction, which instead
use conditional probabilities.
2.4 Economic Research
The common assumption that wealth causes happiness has led a large amount of research to
focus on this particular area. This research varies in many aspects such as: coverage (global, EU
or a single country), type of data used (longitudinal or single instance), topic focused on (both
general analysis and investigations of specific theories or previous findings). For a survey of such
papers the reader is directed to [13]. It is generally agreed that life satisfaction is strongly and
positively correlated with income shown in much previous work such as [16].
A much debated theory is that of the Easterlin Paradox. Richard Easterlin, a Professor of
Economics has contributed much to this area, most notably a paper written in 1974 entitled ÒDoes
Economic Growth Improve the Human Lot? Some Empirical EvidenceÓ [17] Easterlin used two
survey questions, and investigated them separately. The analysis performed included both within
country (America) and cross country data. A key finding was the relationship between income
6
and happiness, which Easterlin found to be strongly positive for data within countries. However,
the cross country analysis found a threshold of income above which there was no correlation.
These findings were named the Easterlin Paradox.
The Easterlin Paradox has been a central focus of debate since then, and the findings are not
decisive. Easterlin notes; ÒChinaÕs growth rate implies a doubling of real per capita income in
less than 10 y ... one might think many of the people in these countries would be so happy, theyd
be dancing in the streetsÓ [18]. An early view by Robbins in 1938 suggests an opposing view,
where after income has reached a certain level it allows happiness values to increase more, because
then additional factors can contribute to life satisfaction levels as improvements to quality of life
become affordable. The work by Robbins has been supported by more recent research such as
[16], a 2008 study using the Gallup World Poll (GWP). This work showed that life satisfaction
was affected more in the rich countries, shown by a noticeable change in the regression curve.
EasterlinÕs most recent paper on this topic was that of ÒThe happiness-income paradox revis-
itedÓ in 2010 [18]. This is an extension of previous work that focused on America. This research
looks at happiness over a number of years and for a wide range of countries (54 in total), using
time series data from four survey sources. Regression was performed both with the datasets as
a whole, and also with subsets where the countries were split into groups. The three groups
were; developing, developed and those in a state of change from communism to capitalism. OLS
regression was used and this showed no significant correlation between rate of growth and life
satisfaction in all regressions performed. Easterlin shows that while happiness does fluctuate with
economic conditions, there is no correlation in the long term for the diverse range of countries
studied. Previous research by Stevenson and Wolfers in 2008 finding that life satisfaction and
growth are positively correlated but Easterlin comments that they use only short term datasets.
He shows that while this is the case there is no evidence of a longer term correlation. [18]
This paper highlights the affect that a few possibly unrepresentative data points can have on
correlations. As an example, the results by Stevenson and Wolfers in 2008 were repeated removing
a small number of results. A correlation that had been found for a dataset of 17 countries, was
re-tested with 2 data points removed and this change meant no significant correlation was then
found. Easterlin also did this for another test with 32 countries, removing transition countries
and finding this again removed the significance. However, here 11 countries were removed which
is a large proportion and hence would more likely affect the correlations found.
This paper has provided a valuable insight into the dual nature of correlation between growth
and happiness (short term and long term), rather than the rather simplistic view that growth
causes happiness as found previously.
Solely GDP growth and time series data was used in this study. Our research is
interested in the happiness differences between countries and hence it is more
appropriate to use point of time data. We also look at several alternative
indicators such as GDP and relative income, as well as GDP growth rate.
A possible issue with this research is the use of financial satisfaction as a label for Latin
American countries. However, this was due to a lack of reliable life data and therefore this was
probably the most suitable alternative. A positive correlation would not prove a correlation be-
tween life satisfaction and growth, but no correlation with financial satisfaction would render a
positive correlation with life satisfaction highly unlikely as financial satisfaction is the component
of life satisfaction most related to GDP growth. In fact, financial satisfaction showed no relation-
ship with GDP growth which is of much surprise, especially where Latin American countries are
growing at 1 - 3% per year. [18]

2.4.1 Survey data and conflicting results
The debate regarding the Easterlin paradox may be due to differences in survey data. It is
important to understand possible affects that different survey procedures may have to be aware
of possible bias in results. Recent work in 2008 by Deaton ([16]) and Bjrnskov ([7]) respectively
has looked at the possible reasons that results from WVS support the Easterlin Paradox but
results from the GWP conflict.
There are some fundamental differences of the surveys noted by Bjrnskov. Firstly, WDH is
an accumulation of multiple sources (although primarily WVS). Secondly, the time point of the
surveys is different, having taken place at around 2000 for WVS compared to 2006 for GWP.
[7] This is a large time gap and there could potentially have been noticeable changes in life
satisfaction during this time.
Deaton notes how the GWP shows a much gentler slope for the correlation between happiness
and GDP, whereas the WVS gives a much steeper rise for low income countries. Deaton accounts
this to several attributes of the surveys. Firstly, WVS includes a smaller set of low income
countries and this part of the correlation may be skewed by the fact that these countries are
mainly post Soviet Union. These countries may have much lower LS because of this, and without
other poor countries to show a balanced view this has caused the sharp rise at the start of the
graph.
An additional possible cause is the sampling performed by the WVS, which in some cases
is not representative of the population as a whole. The population sample in some countries
was taken from those of higher intelligence.3 [16] This is quite surprising and means the data
could be skewed with higher happiness values for these countries. Deaton claims that this in
combination with the Soviet countries mentioned previously has created two types of country in
the low income range, where they are either unusually satisfied or unusually unsatisfied. [16]
The results in [16] are interesting as they do not indicate that one survey is more
reliable than the other, but instead highlight the limits that smaller datasets place
on the results and correlations that can be found. With this in mind a label with
a large sample is preferred, and hence using multiple sources is also considered.
It is noted in [3] that GWP values are more conservative than WVS values such that ÒIt tends
to find higher life satisfactions for rich countries and lower life satisfactions for poor countries
than, for example the World Values Survey doesÓ [3]. Two possible explanations are given for
this. Firstly, possible differences of the coverage within a country, where for instance one survey
may reach more rural areas. Secondly, the question order is different between GWP and WVS,
where the life satisfaction question is after economic and governmental question in GWP but at
the beginning for WVS. This seems likely to cause the difference where people in poorer countries
are likely to give a lower answer after thinking about the poor state of their countries economy,
with an opposite effect to this for richer countries. Bjrnskov also suggests this, additionally noting
that the answer scale of the question can affect results. [7]
The wording of a question may also affect the results. Bjrnskov discusses this comparing
the ladder of life and the more standard life satisfaction question. The key difference is that
the ladder of life bounds of values are referred to as the respondents bounds, rather than more
general bounds, using wording such as best possible life for you. Bjrnskov says Òthe anchoring
technique employed by the GWP is likely to produce smaller scores on average, as responses are
probably anchored in comparison with an ideal situation instead of the weaker anchoring in a
cognitive state of Ôcomplete satisfactionÕ used by the WDHÓ[7].
Possible issues also exist with regards to normalising question meanings across the globe
such that each respondent is answering the same question. Specifically they note how the word
3This has been checked for 2008 (sampling info at: http://www.wvsevsdb.com/wvs/WVSDocumentation.jsp?
Idioma=I) and no bias can be found.
8
ÔhappyÕ needs to be translated accurately across different languages and Òthe English word ÔhappyÕ
is notoriously difficult to translateÓ. [7]
Whilst this work has focused on the correlation between GDP and happiness, it has highlighted
many general differences of surveys which could affect correlations of many other variables.
Small differences in survey format can severely affect results. The WVS and
GWP surveys are both not ideal for different reasons; the selection of respondents
for WVS, and the position of the life satisfaction question in the GWP.
2.4.2 Relative wealth
A Lorenz curve (figure 3(b)) is a graphical representation of the distribution of wealth. The curve
indicates the proportion of the wealth at each percentage of the population. The more convex
the curve the greater the inequality, where a larger proportion of the population has a smaller
proportion of the wealth. A uniform distribution (straight line) represents complete equality.
The Lorenz curve is the idea behind a common deprivation measure known as the Gini index,
which is defined as:
Gini(A,B) =
A
A+B
, (1)
where B is the area under the curve and A is the shaded area above the curve. The values
range between zero and one from uniform to highly unequal respectively.

Figure 3(a) shows global Gini index values from the CIA World Factbook4 2009. This shows a
large amount of variation between countries and even a visual comparison between global values
of Gini index and happiness (figures 3(b) and 1.1 respectively) shows some similar patterns. For
instance, countries in Europe generally has higher happiness levels and a lower Gini index than
those in Africa.
Distribution of wealth may be a valuable indicator of happiness.
2.4.3 A study of relative income
Relative variables such as the Gini index may be valuable indicators of happiness. The variables
we will consider will represent relativity on a country level. Work by Mayraz et al. in 2009 ([34])
investigated the affects of relative income but considered different groups as the comparison
namely friends, neighbourhood and colleagues. The data used were survey questions asking to
give values for their relative income in relation to the different groups mentioned above, and also
the importance they gave this comparison. In fact, these questions were designed by Mayraz
specifically for this research.

Linear regression was used, with slightly different regression equations to answer different
questions. The regression methods are reviewed in detail as they show the flexibility of linear
regression as a tool for data mining (see section 3.3.4).
The basic regression equation is:
Hi = ?+ ?YRi + ?Yi +
·
k
?kX
k
i + ?i (2)
This includes dependent variable H for life satisfaction, constant ? and error ?. The regression
variables include relative income YR, absolute income Yi and a set of control variables Xi. This is
a standard regression function using control variables to account for variation in H due to other
factors such as age and education.
Firstly, the correlation between relative income and life satisfaction was investigated using
a regression equation as above but using log absolute income. The regression was repeated for
each group and also with and without the absolute income variable. The regression results show
quite surprising results, where a significant correlation is found between relative income and life
satisfaction for men but not for women. The coefficient values are smaller when log absolute
income is included in the regression, which is expected as this shows that absolute income makes
some contribution to a personsÕ life satisfaction valuation.
A second investigation in this research looked at the relationship between a personsÕ happiness,
the importance they subjectively place on relative income, and the actual importance of relative
income with respect to happiness. This is important to show that the subjective value is an
adequate representation of the actual importance (as perhaps people perceive it to be important
but in reality it does not affect their happiness). To do this they use the regression formula of
equation 3, where the key difference is the use of an interaction term, which is the product of
relative income and subjective importance (see section 3.1.1 for details of interaction terms).
Hi = ?+ ?jY
j
Ri
+ ??jI
j
Ri
+ ???j Y
j
Ri
IjRi + ?logYi +
·
k
?kX
k
i + ?i (3)
Put simply, this equation is asking whether the correlation between actual income and happi-
ness is dependent on the subjective importance of relative income. A result where the coefficient
of the interaction term is high, and the coefficient of the other terms is reduced, would show that
the interaction between relative income and perceived importance accounted for the variation
of well being better than the individual variables. This would infer that a personsÕ subjective
importance does bear relation to the actual importance of relative income with respect to happi-
ness. Note how this contrasts to the standard regression equation with only independent variables
where each contribute individually through summation to the dependent variables value. The
results of this regression gave very low coefficient values for the interaction term. This shows that
the relationship between relative income and happiness is not governed by a persons perceived
importance of relative income.
One potential weakness of the methods used was the use of surveys to retrieve values for all
variables including that of relative income. A more robust method may have been to survey
each persons income, and record the individuals within the groups so that relative income can
be determined precisely. This however, would be a fairly arduous task. Mayraz tackles this issue
by analysing the causality between happiness and subjective relative income. The concern was
whether a higher relative income caused people to be happier or whether happier people were
perhaps more optimistic in their estimations of relative income. To test this, relative income was
used as the dependent variable and an interaction term of happiness and importance was included.
This was to test if the relationship between relative income and importance is dependent on
happiness, but the results showed that this was not the case. However this does not show whether
subjective relative income is representative of actual relative income on a more fundamental level.
A final investigation by Mayraz looked at whether the difference in happiness from the mean
is of equal magnitude either side for higher and lower relative income values. For instance, given
10
mean relative income mi with happiness mh, and person X with relative income mI + p and
happiness mH + q. If a person Y has relative income mi ? p is his happiness mh ? q? The
hypothesis tested is that those with low relative income lose more happiness that a person gains
who has high relative income, meaning that with each unit increase in relative income, the change
in happiness decreases. Testing this with linear regression required transforming this hypothesised
correlation into a linear one, by way of a quadratic transformation (illustrated in figure 3). This
is the third term in the regression formula (equation 4 below).

Mayraz notes that the coefficient for this quadratic variable will be negative if there is an
asymmetric relationship. This is because the relationship hypothesised is concave and these result
in negative coefficient values, in contrast to convex correlations which have positive coefficient
values. To see why take a simple regression equation y = ax2 + b and differentiate with respect
to x to give ¶y¶x = 2ax. It can be seen that negative values of a give a decreasing rate of change as
x increases and hence a concave curve. The results for each group however give values very close
to zero, and in fact only 3 of these are negative values. This indicates that the rate of change of
happiness with relative income does not decrease as relative income values increase.
This research has demonstrated the versatility of linear regression to answer a range of ques-
tions regarding variable relationships, using both interaction terms and logarithmic and quadratic
transformations. Of particular note is the use of interaction variables to analyse causality between
variables, showing an additional approach to using longitudinal data.
Other research looks at non economic variables, such as a 2005 paper by Oswald et al. ÒDoes
happiness adapt? A longitudinal study of disability with implications for economists and judgesÓ
[39]. Oswald et al. (2005) analysed time series data to investigate the affect a disability has
on well-being. The results showed a clear trend, where life satisfaction dropped significantly on
gaining a disability, but remarkably bounced back to just below the original value showing the
strength of our ability to adapt in adversity.
2.5 Research of Other Indicators
2.5.1 Health
Health may have a marked effect on happiness, a notion supported by previous research. We
suggest a distinction between health variables depending on whether they are recoverable, due
to the psychological differences between the two situations. For instance the paper above dis-
cussing disabilities showed happiness values returning to previous levels. A long standing but
non permanent health issue however, may have a higher affect on happiness, due to the belief
that they could be healthier than they are. A person becoming disabled does not have this hope
and therefore adapts to this permanent change in their life.
11
Causality relationships with health may be particularly unclear, where conditions
such as hypertension could be effects rather than causes of happiness. This does
not affect a variables viability as an indicator and both types will be considered
for this project.
Blanchflower & Oswald have investigated the relationship between hypertension (high blood
pressure) and happiness [8], with an aim to incorporate hypertension as a variable in a well-being
index. This research used life satisfaction and happiness responses from the Eurobarometer
survey, and the hypertension values were also derived from the survey data. Correlations were
assessed using both Pearsons and Spearmans rank tests, and OLS and logit regression5 were used.
The R2 was used to validate the regression model (see section 3.3.1).
Individuals were used as entities with country dummy variables as controls (a binary variable
for each country where the country of the individual is ÕonÕ and the others are ÕoffÕ). The
dependent variables of the regression tests were hypertension and life satisfaction. The results
showed correlation between hypertension and happiness. For instance, when looking at the very
satisfied responses the countries with the lowest blood pressure gave significantly higher happiness
values (48.5% compared with 22.5%).
While the results are encouraging, some aspects of this research may not be ideal. Firstly the
data sample is not quite small, consisting of just 16 countries. Also, the hypertension data came
from the question ÒWould you say that you have had problems of high blood pressure?Ó, which
makes this a subjective measure. We question whether hypertension can really be estimated
accurately through self assessment, as for instance it does not distinguish between high blood
pressure and hypochondria. However, this was necessary for this research because the entities
were individuals and hence the data needed to consist of happiness and hypertension values for
each person. It may be worth a study into the accuracy of this self assessment through asking
this question to individuals where actual blood pressure readings have been taken and can thus
be compared.
Our project, with country entities uses more concrete health indicators derived
from country records rather than self assessment such as life expectancy.
2.5.2 Light
Light may be an interesting correlate because of possible links with depression. Seasonal Affective
Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression where the individuals are affected only in the winter
months. SAD is thought to be caused by the lack of light, which affects the release of certain
chemicals in the brain causing a change in mood [40]. Depression levels of SAD sufferers can
vary widely throughout the year and this suggests light may have be a contributor to happiness
levels, although no previous data mining work could be found regarding this. Previous research
has however, found correlation between prevalence of SAD and latitude, such as [44].
Light may correlate with happiness and hence is considered as a feature.
2.5.3 Climate
Previous work has found evidence for a relationship between climate variables and happiness.
The implications of a correlation between happiness and climate are vast. The threat of climate
change causing large shifts in weather patterns means that a relationship between climate and
happiness would likely cause changes in happiness levels. Climate variables add much complexity
to this problem as they are likely to be closely related to other variables of interest. A key
5Regression where the data is fit to a logistic curve
12
example of this is health, where weather causes an increase of some illnesses. For instance, flu is
known to be higher in the colder months6.
Rehdanz & Maddison performed a comprehensive investigation into the relationship between
climate and happiness using a wide range of variables [42]. The choice of variables includes some
interesting options. Firstly the climate variables used were annual mean values of temperature
and rainfall and indicators of extremes such as the precipitation of the wettest month. Absolute
latitude was used to represent amount of daylight. Other variables were also included to control
for other differences. Of particular interest is the construction of a variable to control for the
countries that were previously communist, necessary as their initial analysis showed that these
countries were the ones with the lowest temperature. A variable is needed to control for this or
else the results would be biased and incorrect. Other variables included are taken from previous
research such as religion and life expectancy.
Of particular note was the pre-processing of the variables to produce appropriate indicators.
This is needed to ensure the values are representative of the country as a whole, because climate
variables vary across countries and this is independent of the distribution of populations. The
values assigned should be values representative of the populated areas. [42] accounted for this by
taking the weighted average of several cities of a country, weighted by the population.
Care should be taken to ensure the variables are representative of a country, such
as by using a weighted average as in the example above.
Several regression tests were performed using different groups of climate variables, together
with the control variables. This segregation was needed to remove collinearity, which would affect
results. For example, two variables are the average mean temperature and the number of months
where the temperature exceeds 20?C, and these variables clearly have a close relationship. A
regression equation with both these variables would attempt to attribute the same variance of
the label to both of these variables.
This research performed separate regression using the different variable groups as explained
above, and therefore it is interesting to compare these results. The results showed that the max
and min temperature variables correlate negatively and positively respectively, which is expected
as this infers people prefer medium temperatures to extremes. However, the regression using
count variables of the number of cold and hot months, showed a negative correlation between
number of cold months and happiness and a positive correlation between the number of hot
months and happiness, indicating a preference for warmer climates. This is supported by the
final regression which used mean values, and found a strong positive correlation between annual
mean temperature and happiness. The t-statistic was however lower than that of mean rainfall
in this regression showing that this has a stronger correlation than mean temperature.
The variable groups represented similar concepts but resulted in different
regression models, highlighting the sensitivity of variables selection and the
importance of trying different alternatives that represent similar concepts.
The regression with maximum / minimum values proved to be the best representation, with
the highest R2 value of 0.7918 (possible values range between 0 and 1 where 1 means the variables
completely predict the dependent variable), although this is only marginally larger. In fact, all
three models showed significant correlations with happiness, with a highest f-statistic of 0.0081.
Also, all models generated using the different groups of climate variables passed the RESET test
showing these models were able to represent correlation with happiness.

These results show interesting results, primarily that climate indicators are good
correlates with happiness.
2.6 Causal Inferences
Causality of happiness is an interesting subject as there are many possible correlates where the
direction of causality is unclear. There has been only a limited amount of work looking at this.
Investigating causality is beyond the scope of this project.
Previous work has found married people have higher happiness levels and research by Stutzer
et al. in 2006 looked at the relationship between marriage and happiness [47]. Establishing
causality required the use of longitudinal data7; a dataset recording values related to the same
entity over time. The relationship between changes in variable values over time can indicate
causality. For instance, does happiness increase after marriage to infer that marriage makes
people happy? Or are happier people married because one is more likely to find love if they are
happy?
The dataset was split into three groups; remaining single, married and marry later in life. The
life satisfaction scores were adjusted for different factors such as age and gender, but the methods
for this are not specified. Even so, the results are fascinating, and simply through graphing the
data and visual examination interesting results can be detected. For instance, at age 20 the people
who go on later to marry have much higher life satisfaction than those that stay single. Also
for these people, there was a steady increase in happiness in the years prior to marriage, which
returns to the previous value in approximately the same length of time afterwards. Additionally
they find this trend is also found for people who marry and subsequently divorce but at lower
levels of happiness. This shows that people who are less happy are less likely to marry and more
likely to divorce, indicating happiness causes marriage.
Longitudinal data analysis is a valuable way of determining causality and as can be seen from
this paper the causality can often be very apparent. However, this has also highlighted the fact
that happiness is often not changed suddenly, but gradually over a period of time. For instance,
increased happiness caused by marriage is not suddenly altered but gradually increased over a
number of years prior to marriage, perhaps due to the hope and thoughts of marrying in the
future or being in a long term stable relationship. This means that analysis needs to be over a
wide time span to fully investigate causal affects.
This indicates that variables may have better correlation if several years are used.
One option is to construct a weighted average where more distant years have less
contribution.

3 Methods Overview
3.1 Data Preparation
The success of classifiers and prediction methods depend heavily on the quality and choice of
the data used. [5] Domain knowledge is important to be able to choose features that are likely
to bring good results, and previous work reviewed in section 2 provides important background
information of this subject area. Data preparation and feature selection are two critical parts of
a data mining project.
3.1.1 Feature construction
The data collated can be used directly or can be manipulated to provide alternative features
which may be more effective in models. This stage is an opportunity to use domain knowledge to
construct appropriate features for analysis. This includes simple techniques such as combining
values into a single feature, or more complex methods such as principal component analysis
(PCA).
Feature variables can be constructed in the following ways:
¥ Time correlations Time series data can be used to calculate the relative change of a
variable, which can be used as a feature.
¥ Transformations Data transformations such as log, square-root, square and PCA (see
below).
¥ Interactions Features can be constructed using mathematical functions on several vari-
ables. Many of these are readily available such as GDP per capita.
Transformations Transformations are common in linear regression, as the linear nature
would otherwise be restrictive when non-linear relationships exist. Performing transformations
allows non linear correlations to be found when using linear techniques.
Transformations with logs is particularly common, and additionally this gives an additional
property beyond just changing the relationship between the variables. Standard variables corre-
late with the dependent variable in the standard way of the formulation a = bx + c, such that
when the value of x changes by 1 the value of a changes by b. However the values of the coeffi-
cients produced depend on the units of the variables. Introducing logs changes this so that the
relationship between the log of the independent variable and the dependent variable is now in
percentages such that it represents the relative rather than the average change. [20]
Interaction terms Interaction terms are useful when the relationship between several vari-
ables needs investigating, such as where the correlation between an independent and the depen-
dent variable may additionally depend on a third variable (see section 2.4.3 for an example using
this). This is a simple regression function with two variables X and Y that are also interaction
terms:
f(X) = ?0 +Xj?j +Xk?k +
·
XjYj?j , (5)
3.1.2 Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a powerful method to find hidden patterns in datasets, by performing an orthogonal8
transformation of the dataset into a set of new variables called principal components. Given a
set of data points we can view these as points in a multidimensional space, where the axes are
8Orthogonal refers to the fact that the axes of the principal components are perpendicular to each other, just
as the x and y axis in a typical 2 dimensional space
15
just arbitrarily defined. The axes can be moved such that they correspond to the directions of
highest variance, and this can reveal hidden patterns in the data.
To perform PCA it is important to first normalise the data, so that all variables have mean
zero and variance 1. If variables with different variance are used this would affect the PCA
results. The problem involves solving an eigenvector/eigenvalue problem and the derivation is
given below.
PCA derivation Given a data matrix X, where each row is the transpose of a data point:
xi =
[
xi(1)
xi(2)
]
X =
[
x1(1) x1(2)
x2(1) x2(2)
]
X =
[
xT1
xT2
]
,
PCA finds vectors w representing new axes, along which the variance of the data points is
maximised. The position of xi along this axis is found by projecting onto w: x
Tw. For example,
if x =
[
2 1
]
when projected onto vector
[
1
1
]
is:
[
2 1
]? [ 1
1
]
= 3
The variance of a set of values is given by V ar(X) = E(X ? µ)2. Under the assumption that
the data is centred (µ = 0) then V ar(X) = E(X)2. Therefore, the variance of X along w is
E(xTw)2. Therefore the aim is to find:

where n is the number of data points. This equates to:

wT (XTX)w [15] (7)
Increasing the values of w will always increase the results of this however, so w is bounded
by wTw ² 1. This value will always equal 1 in solutions because for any w where wTw < 1 a
higher value of equation 6 will always be found by increasing w such that wTw = 1.
This is incorporated into the problem equation using a Lagrange multiplier. These are com-
monly used to find the solutions of problems seeking to minimise or maximise a function subject
to a particular constraint. In this case we are maximising equation 6 subject to the constraint
wTw ² 1. Equations using Lagrange multipliers take the following form:
f(W,w)? ?(g(X,w)? k), [6] (8)
where f is the original function, g is the constraint and k is a constant such that g(X,w)?k = 0.
Hence in this case k = 1 because wTw? k = 0 and wTw = 1.
Therefore the PCA formulation becomes:

and the left side equates to the variance (we are back to the original equation 6). [15] The
eigenvector w is a new axis and itÕs eigenvalue ? represents the degree of variance along it.
W is a matrix of vectors of the directions of greatest variance, ordered by eigenvalue. Those
w with low ? typically have little variance and can often be ignored.

(14)
The original data points can be transformed into the new space by projecting onto the vectors
in W:
Xnew = XW (15)
The relationship between eigenvalue and variance means that each principal component p1 to
pd, ordered by eigenvalue contains the highest amount of information (variance) not accounted
for by p1 to pd?1. This is important for data analysis as the key principal components are often
highly informative. Additionally, the dimensionality can often be reduced by using the PCs
instead of the original data and ignoring PCs containing a low proportion of the variance of the
original data.
3.1.3 Missing values
The data used in this project will contain some missing values, as it is collated from different
sources. Machine learning methods often require that all the features have values, although many
have inbuilt methods for dealing with this. We may prefer to choose to remove missing values
prior to using ML methods and there are three main ways of doing this; reduction of the dataset,
indicator variables, and imputation. Reducing the dataset involves removing entities where the
data is incomplete. This is not feasible for this project as this will remove whole countries from
the analysis (although the coverage will be considered when choosing potential features).
In some cases there is an underlying reason why values are missing from the dataset and
this may in itself contribute valuable information. As an example, time series data of a country
may have missing values during periods of conflict or natural disaster, and this may itself be a
correlate with happiness. Data analysis using background knowledge is important to determine
the significance of a null value and whether it may have relevance. If so the null values can
be replaced with an indicator variable to represent the underlying cause. [53] However, for this
project it will usually be the case that the data is missing because a country was simply not
included, as each data source will have slightly different coverage. Indicator variables may be
appropriate in a minority of cases but inference of missing values (imputation) is likely to be of
most use.
17
3.1.4 Imputation
Imputation is the technique of using the data available to infer a value that is missing from the
dataset. Features are used to complete the data of another feature, which can then be used in
the data mining methods. Two well known options are mean (or mode) or nearest neighbour.
Regression can also be used to infer values, an example of this is given in section 2.2 where linear
regression was used to infer values of GWP from other survey sources. Often ML methods have
built in methods for imputation. For example, decision trees have in built methods to infer a
missing values, such as the surrogacy method of the M5 algorithm (section 3.3.6).
Mean or mode This is a naive approach of replacing a missing value with the mean or
mode values of the entire dataset. The value assigned is the same for all instances and no attempt
is made to infer a value more representative using other variables of the instance.
Weighted k-nearest neighbour The nearest neighbour algorithm is a simple inference
method for numeric variables where the missing value is assigned the value of the entity closest
to it according to a specified distance measure. The k-nearest neighbour (KNN) is an extension
where it is assigned the average value of the k nearest elements, and weighting gives closer nodes
a larger contribution to the value. [53]
Previous work has investigated the performance of weighted k-nearest neighbour imputation.
Work by [29] included testing on several datasets, by removing values to create data with artificial
missing values. The missing values were then imputed and could be compared against the true
values by calculating the average error of the predicted values. The tests were performed both
with the Euclidean and Manhattan distance measures. The Euclidean distance is given by:
d(X,Y ) =
ÃÃÃÃ n·
i=1
(Xi ? Yi)2, (16)
and the Manhattan distance by:
d(X,Y ) =
n·
i=1
(Xi ? Yi), (17)
The Manhattan distance is the sum of the individual distances between the variables, whereas
the Euclidean is the distance moving directly from point X to point Y in the variable space. The
key difference is that the Euclidean distance prefers fewer larger deviations to many smaller
deviations. As an example consider two feature sets X and Y with two features. Consider
the following two situations for the distance di between X and Y for the two features; {d11 = 1,
d12 = 3} and {d21 = 2, d22 = 2}. The distance between both these feature sets for the Manhattan
distance is 4. However, the Euclidean distance gives different values; e1 = 3.16 and e2 = 2.8. In
this situation the first feature set would be deemed closer according to the Euclidean distance,
but this may not be ideal as one of the variables has a larger distance and is hence less similar.
Imputation was also performed with the mean method to provide a comparison. KNN with
Euclidean distance was found to predict the values better than both KNN with Manhattan and
the mean imputation method. Both NN methods showed better results than the mean method.
This was expected, but in fact NN was better in 71% of cases and we might expect this to
have been higher. The Manhattan distance proved better than the Euclidean, although these
results were quite similar. Manhattan may be preferable because of the bias in the Euclidean
measurement for longer distances.
An important consideration when using KNN is the variable units, as KNN is sensitive to the
scales used. For instance, a distance variable may be given in miles or metres and this affects the
KNN results. Therefore normalisation needs to be performed so that the scales are consistent
and comparable. Also, the features may have different importance. Therefore it is necessary to
18
determine which features are most relevant. Incorporating features that bear no correlation to
the missing value can skew results. Variables may have different relative significance, and it may
be preferable to weight the distances according to this. [53]
A further difficulty is the choice of K, which needs to be optimised manually. A K that is too
small means that only a few instances are used which may not give a good approximation of the
missing value as it over fits the data. A K that is too large will mean instances that are quite far
(and hence perhaps quite different) contribute to the instances value. Finding the optimal value
of K requires testing with different values. [4]
KNN will be useful to impute missing values in our dataset. The data available to us contains
variables representing different aspects of human life such as health, education and wealth with
multiple variables of each. We ideally would use a single variable representing a single concept to
prevent dependence between features. The missing values of a feature could be imputed from the
set of features representing the same concept, which is appropriate as the features are likely to
have a good correspondence with these variables. For example, using several educational variables
impute missing values of another education variable may be effective.
19
3.2 Statistical & Machine Learning Methods
We use both statistical and machine learning methods throughout this work. ML techniques can
be divided into two main types; black box or white box. The methods used to classify or regress
can be understood and analysed with white box techniques, which is useful to gain understanding
of the relationships between the input and target variables. We intend to use several statistical
and ML methods, and describe those of particular interest.
3.3 Statistical Tests
The main statistical methods to determine results significance are correlation with R2, t-tests
and permutation testing.
3.3.1 Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (R)
R is a measure of correlation of two datasets with values ranging from -1 to 1 where -1 and 1
represent perfect negative and positive correlations respectively. More specifically, this measure
represents the variance of the label that is explained by the model relative to the unexplained
variance. A value of 0 indicates that there is no correlation between the variables. R is the
covariance of the variables relative to their individual variance, given by the formula:
rx,y =
Cx,y
?2x?
2
y
, (18)
where C and ?2 are the covariance and variance respectively.
Quantitative measure for results analysis A consistent measure is needed to compare
results and the correlation coefficient (R) will be used. This is appropriate because it is a measure
of the goodness of fit of a model. The correlation value is not affected by the number of features of
the model, which is important as we are comparing tests involving a variable number of features.
P-value A p-value indicates the significance of a result, representing the probability the
result would occur by chance. A low value means the result is unlikely to occur randomly and
hence is statistically significant. Threshold values of 5% and 1% are commonly used, below which
a result can be stated as significant. Statistical tests can be relative to test parameters such as
the size of the dataset, and a p-value provides a comparable value that takes into account such
aspects of the data.
R2 and Adjusted R2 R2 is also known as the coefficient of determination, and is an
extension of the R value. It represents the proportion of variation in the label that can be
accounted for by the regression model. However R is relative to the number of variables used in
the model and therefore is not comparable when this differs. Adjusted R2 takes into consideration
the number of variables used in the regression.
3.3.2 T-Test
A t-test calculates the likelihood that two datasets are generated from the same probability
distribution. We use this measure to compare results such as the performance of two learners. A
t-test performed on the results of 10 fold cross validation for instance determines the likelihood
that these two results sets come from the same distribution. A result indicating they are from
different distributions indicates that one performs significantly better.
20
3.3.3 Significance testing with permutation testing
Permutation testing is used to compute a p-value of results when the probability distribution is
not known. For instance, suppose we find a model with a correlation value and we wish to know
the likelihood that a model with this correlation would occur by chance for data from the same
distribution. The null hypothesis states that the correlation is likely to occur on random data.
Therefore the null hypothesis is rejected when the result is unlikely on random data and hence
is significant.
Permutation tests amount to sampling from the distribution of a data set by randomly per-
muting the data. The samples are taken many times and the test performed and this gives a
probability distribution of results for the random data. The proportion of times the results are
ÔbetterÕ than that originally found is the p-value:
p? value = #p ? P : T (p) ³ v
#p ? P , (19)
where v is the original test value, P is the set of permutations and T is the test performed.
Equivalently, a threshold value t? such that at most 5% of the permutation tests give a value
ÔbetterÕ than this value can be found:
#p ? P : T (p) ³ t?
#p ? P ² 0.05, (20)
This value can then be compared against all results to determine if it is significant. This
is a useful alternative where the significance of several results needs assessing, because a single
threshold value can be compared against many results rather than calculating a specific p-value
for each.
3.3.4 Linear Regression
Linear regression is a method to model the output value as a linear contribution of the inputs.
With respect to this project this can be used to determine a function f : X ? Y , where X is a
vector of feature values and Y is a happiness ground truth. The linear nature of the representation
produced can sometimes be too simplistic, as the target may not be linearly correlated with the
feature set. However, linear regression is well known to produce accurate results and can also
outperform more complex non linear methods.
A typical regression formula is:
f(X) = ?0 +
n·
i=1
Xj?j , [27] (21)
with bias ?0 and weight ?j of feature j in X. The feature space is a multidimensional space
and the aim is to find a line in this space that best fits the data points. ?0 would then represent
the intersect on the axis of f(X).
There are several methods to estimate the coefficients ?j for the model. These include; least
squares, principal component regression, ridge regression and the lasso.
Least squares The least square is a simple and common measure of error of a regression
model given by;
RSS(?) =
n·
i=1
(yi ? f(xi))2. [27] (22)
with n elements in the training set, target value yi and regression output f(xi). Linear
regression using this measure aims to minimise the sum of the squared error (or residue) on the
training data. The square of the error is used instead of just the absolute error to give a preference
for smaller deviations from the target values.
21
3.3.5 The Least Absolute Shrink and Selection Operator (Lasso)
A significant weakness of OLS regression is that it cannot regress to the correct function where
the feature variables are not independent. There are three key methods which improve OLS
regression; subset selection, ridge regression and lasso. [49] Lasso, was originally proposed in
1996 by Tibshirani as an alternative to ridge regression and subset selection. [49]
Subset selection and ridge regression have some drawbacks and TibshiraniÕs aim, described
in [49], was to combine the best of both, and he describes the following shortfalls with these
techniques. Subset selection includes methods such as stepwise regression, and these methods
involve fairly large discrete changes to the model, as variables are added or removed. Also, this
method is quite sensitive to changes to the input data. Ridge regression is an improvement
on subset selection because it uses continuous changes to the model by altering the size of the
coefficients in the regression function. However, it is unable to reduce any coefficient to zero and
therefore does not remove any completely from the feature space. [49]
Ridge regression and lasso are both a specific type of regularisation method known as shrinkage
methods. Regularisation methods constrain the search space by using penalties, and specifically
for shrinkage methods this reduces the size of the coefficient in the regression function. The
search space is the set of all possible regression functions for a feature set, with all possible
coefficient values. As an example, the error calculation could incorporate the sum of squares
of all coefficients, such that when the coefficients have lower values the error is also lower (this
example is the penalty for ridge regression as detailed below). [6] Regularisation prevents over
fitting by imposing pressure towards simpler functions with small coefficients.
The aim of lasso is to perform constrained regression, such that the minimum number of
features are used that are required to explain the data. This is done by finding features that
highly correlate and removing all but one of these from the feature space. It does this by reducing
the coefficient size in the regression function, such that some can be reduced to zero and hence
are removed from the feature space. Therefore lasso combines the gradual changes of shrinkage
methods with the ability to reduce the feature set, the valuable aspects of ridge regression and
subset selection respectively.
Equation 23 shows the lasso optimisation problem, where n and m are the number of data
points and features respectively.

wj is the coefficient of variable j in the model, and regularisation constrains the sum of these
coefficients. ? is the bias in model, such that under the assumption of standardised data such

N = 0 the data is centred and the ? can be omitted. [49] This results in the following
equation:

It is interesting to note just how similar this is to ridge regression, where the regularising
component of the equation is instead ??w?2. [49] This difference gives lasso the key property of
often reducing coefficient values to zero providing much value for feature selection.
How lasso works Lasso is not a greedy approach but uses least angle regression (LARS)
to find the model. LARS is similar to forward stepwise regression (FSR). FSR works by firstly
starting with an empty model, finding the variable most correlated with the label and adding
this to the model. The residual is taken, which is the difference between the label value and the
22
value predicted by the model. Then recursively the variable is found that is most correlated with
the residual and this is added to the model. Thus gradually the model accounts for more of the
variation in the model by incorporating more features.[48]
LARS is different because it does not add a variable to the model with the real coefficient
value. Instead the coefficient is the lowest value such that it is not the variable most correlated
with the label. This is done by increasing the coefficient gradually and at each step taking the
residual. The correlations of this residual with each variable is taken until another variable has
the same correlation with the residual as the original variable. LARS maintains a variable set,
and the process is repeated with this gradually growing set of variables. The coefficients of
the variables in the set are increased together (equiangular such that it is proportionate to their
current coefficient values), until another variable has the same correlation with the residual, which
is then added to this set.[19] This is continued gradually adding more variables until all predictor
have been incorporated. This can be demonstrated with a simple example, for the relationship
y = a+ 2b and the example data of table 4(a). The starting model is: y = ?0 + ?aa+ ?bb, where
all ? are zero.

Figure 4: Example lasso walk through
The steps taken to create a model are:
¥ Find correlations of each variable with the label (y): a = 0.6358 and b = 0.8954.
¥ b has the highest correlation. The coefficient of b is increased until the correlation with the
residual is higher for variable a (table 4(b)): ?b = 0.9.
¥ Find ?ab: ?ab(a + 0.9b), increasing until correlation is reduced to zero (which is the corre-
lation of the bias variable because it is constant) (table 4(c)): ?ab = 1.7.
¥ All predictors are now in the model therefore we can find the bias. Take the mean of the
residual: -0.5600.
¥ Therefore the model is: y = 1.7a+ (1.7 ? 0.9b)? 0.56 ? y = 1.7a+ 1.53b? 0.56.
¥ The sum of squared error (ss) is: 2.6056. Comparing this with a model where ?ab is not
increased far enough and the error is higher: betaab = 1.0 then ss = 4.8400.
Lasso vs OLS Lasso is more stable than OLS regression because where several variables are
similar they are both included equally in the model, rather than one representing both and the
other being excluded.[49] The lasso uses LARS to generate the model but regularises to bound
the total size of the coefficients.[48] Regularising reduces overfitting, as an unregularised model
can have any coefficient values and hence may fit the training data too closely. Lasso uses 10
fold cross validation to find the best ? value to regularise such that the error on the test set is
minimised. A ? value that is too large does not regularise sufficiently and the model overfits the
training data. A ? value that is too restrictive such that the model cannot represent the stable
patterns (that are present in both the training and test data).
3.3.6 Decision Trees
Decision trees are an effective ML method, with a simple and intuitive construction algorithm.
They are a white box technique where the generated tree can be analysed to gain understanding.
Tree construction takes a vector of instances as input, consisting of a set of input variables
and a target variable. The tree is constructed by starting at the root and choosing a variable at
each node to split the dataset, a process known as recursive partitioning. At each node down the
23
the tree this is repeated, with progressively smaller subsets of the original dataset. This process
ends when a stopping condition is met, such as a minimum number of instances at a node, and
this node is then a leaf of the tree.
Decision trees use a greedy approach where the best split at each node is used without looking
at the tree as a whole. This is necessary as the search space of all possible trees is too large to
search exhaustively. This property means the tree may be sub-optimal, but also that it is a simple
and fast method that can be applied to big datasets.
Decision trees automatically perform feature selection where an impurity measures determines
the variable chosen at each node, and hence variables that do not help predict the target value
are automatically ignored. This selection of variables with the highest information gain also
means there is a bias for smaller trees. Decision trees therefore seek to model relationships in the
simplest way. Also, there is no assumption of a specific type of correlation between the variables
and the target value, unlike other algorithms such as linear regression. [53]
The tree structure can give valuable insight into the strength of the correlation between each
variable and the target value. In addition, the tree can be converted to a set of rules, known as
classification rules. This is done by starting at the root and constructing a rule for the path from
the root to each leaf.
There are several algorithms for constructing decision trees, differing in how they determine
which attribute to use at each node to split the dataset. ID3 and C4.5 are common examples
but these are not suitable for our needs as they are classifiers and cannot be applied to regression
tasks.
Regression trees There are several alternative construction algorithms for regression trees
where the main difference is the measure used to split the data at the internal nodes. A classifi-
cation and regression tree (CART) uses the Gini index as an impurity measure, which is similar
to entropy9 but for continuous values. The Gini gain indicates the increase in inequality in the
child nodes compared to the parent node, when splitting on a particular feature. Alternatively
variance can be used such as the implementation of REPTree10 by Weka.
Model trees Regression trees can be further extended to contain linear regression func-
tions at each leaf node, and these are known as model trees. [53] Model trees are built in the
same way as regression trees except that additionally linear regression is performed at each leaf
using the instances assigned to it. The m5 algorithm is a model tree generation algorithm. A
further alternative is logistic model trees, using logistic regression at each leaf rather than linear
regression. This may be preferable where a logistic correspondence between features and labels
is more representative than a linear relationship.
Model trees have several benefits over regression trees including smaller trees and greater
accuracy. This is because a single leaf represents a range of values and thus a model can fit these
better than a single value. In addition, they can also be used for extrapolation, as the linear
function generalises to values that are outside those of the original dataset.
Missing values Decision tree algorithms handle missing values automatically, using differ-
ent methods to do this (or imputation can be performed prior to using ML, see section 3.1.3).
CART and M5 algorithms use a technique called surrogate splitting. This involves a second vari-
able at a node, that is used to split the instances where an instance does not have a value for the
main variable. The split used for the second variable is chosen such that it is most representative
of the split of the first variable. [22]
9Entropy is used by ID3 and C4.5 and represents how well a particular attributes divides the dataset with
respect to the target variable.

Size of tree (number of nodes)
On training data
On test data
Figure 5: Overfitting [37]
Overfitting Decision trees are prone to overfitting,
where a tree fits the training data well but does not gen-
eralise well to the unseen case and hence performs poorly
on test data. Pruning is a common technique which can be
carried out either during or after tree construction, named
pre-pruning and post-pruning respectively. [53] Prepruning
constrains the tree size while it is being constructed, using a
stopping condition to prevent further child nodes. Commonly,
the number of instances at each node is used, which ensures
the rules in the tree are generalised to cover several instances.
Prepruning model trees means the regression model at each
leaf is formed using more instances.
Post-pruning is carried out after the tree is built. This involves using a separate test set and
checking each node from the leaves to the root by comparing the error of each node with that of
itÕs parent. If the parent has a lower error the child nodes can be pruned. This can be seen in
figure 5, where a large tree has a low accuracy on the test set and this improves by reducing its
size until the test and training error values are similar (around size 20 in this example). Post-
pruning can be more effective than pre-pruning as it uses an independent dataset to test the rules
of the tree.
Decision tree critique Decision trees can be used for feature selection as explained above.
Here we look in more detail at the algorithms behind tree construction to highlight any limitations
of using this learner for this purpose. We look specifically at WekaÕs ([26]) M5P tree11 which
implements the standard M5 model tree algorithm. [41] One concern for this algorithm is the
construction of the linear models at the leaves as we would like to infer information from these
models, but if a linear model includes dependent variables the model is unstable and cannot be
used in this way.

Figure 6: Tree pruning
limitations
The M5P algorithm does make use of the information gained from
tree construction to create the leaf models. These models are gener-
ated after post-pruning using only the features part of the sub-tree
just pruned, and this reduces the likelihood of dependent variables
within leaf models. Each leaf will use only the features most appro-
priate for that portion of the dataset in its model.[51] However, de-
pendent and irrelevant attributes can still occur, due to differences in
subtrees. For instance, given a subtree such as that in figure 6, where
pruning is performed such that node A is a leaf, and subtrees B and
C are pruned. Attributes used at nodes B and C may be highly cor-
relating dependent variables where small differences in the instances
down these branches meant one was preferred (marginally) over the
other. These could be two variables representing similar concepts,
health expenditure and immunisation rate for instance. Additionally,
as the depth increases in tree construction the subsets at each node become smaller and thus it
becomes more likely that irrelevant / non optimal features are chosen.
The pruned nodes consist of rules that perform badly on unseen data and so are a poor
generalisation. The features above this node in the tree are more stable splitting criteria because,
they havenÕt been pruned and so these rules are good generalisations to unseen data (largely
because they were constructed using a larger proportion of the dataset because they are higher
in the tree). Therefore, it is unclear why the variables of the pruned nodes are used to construct
the models rather than those of the nodes above.
M5P does attempt to drop terms from the leaf models with the aim of minimising the expected
error on unseen data (to prevent overfitting of the training data). This is done using equation 25,
11class: weka.classifiers.trees.M5P
25
where n is the number of training examples and v is the number of features in the regression
model. [51]
Errorexpected = Errortrain ? n+ v
n? v (25)
The VC dimension12 of a linear model increases with the number of variables, which increases
the likelihood of overfitting. Incorporating this value into the error estimation therefore gives a
preference for models with low VC dimensions. The method used for removing variables in the
model in order to minimise Errorexpected is a greedy algorithm, where the features are tested
sequentially to see if removing them reduces Errorexpected.
It is clear that this method, although not intended for this use, may be quite effective at
removing the dependent variables. For instance, returning to the example of figure 6, this algo-
rithm would try removing A and B in turn. If the variance of the label accounted for by A is
also accounted for by B then removing A would have little affect on the error, but Errorexpected
will be lower because the feature set is smaller, and thus A is removed from the model.
This is however quite a crude approach, with the use of a greedy algorithm. Assessing the
variables sequentially can cause a variable to be removed when it may be preferable to remove
an alternative one. For instance, suppose that removing variable B gives a lower Errorexpected
to removing variable A. Since A is considered first this means that A is removed rather than
B, and this is not the optimal solution. This problem is heightened by the division of the data
set such that each leaf has only a small subset, which adds instability because a small dataset is
more likely to affected by variations or anomalies.
Therefore, decision trees can be used (after pruning) for feature selection using the internal
nodes. However, the features used in the leaf models cannot be used. This is because the variables
included in the leaf model are from pruned nodes, and the method of reducing the expected error
is a crude greedy approach which may produce models containing a suboptimal feature set.
During feature selection regression trees may be preferred to model trees, to
construct larger and more informative trees.
Summary Decision trees have may beneficial properties. Firstly the automatic feature se-
lection is useful where there are dependent variables. Also, the tree structure that is generated
can be highly informative. Decision trees can represent non linear patterns, where different seg-
ments of the trees can contain different rules. The variations of decision trees such as regression
and model trees, and the ability to use both numeric and nominal features, provides much flexi-
bility. These features in combination with the ability to analyse the tree structure makes this a
useful learner for this project.
However, we have also highlighted some areas of concern. Firstly, further down the tree smaller
subsets of the data are used and hence it becomes more likely to select irrelevant attributes.
Additionally, dependent attributes can still be selected where they are preferable to split the
data at different points in the tree. Therefore, when using model trees dependant attributes can
still be used to construct the leaf models.
3.3.7 Support Vector Machines
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were created by Vladimir Vapnik in 1992 and are a powerful
machine learning technique that can be used for both regression and classification problems.
This method uses theory and techniques from machine learning and statistical theory that were
already well known. [14]
Support vector regression (SVR) is a special type of SVM. The standard SVM is used for
classification and will be introduced briefly (but SVR involves some alternate methods). The SVM
12VC dimension specifies the degree of complexity of a hypothesis that can be generated by a learner

hyperplane is positioned to give the largest margin between itself and the nearest classification
points (and hence is known as a maximum margin hyperplane). The points sitting on the margin
constitute the support vectors, and since a support vector is the ÔfrontÕ of an output value (see
figure 7(a)), there must be at least one for each class value. For example, a boolean output will
have two support vectors, with the maximal margin hyperplane sitting directly between them.
SVMs seek to find the parameters of the hyperplane given by a weight vector w, which
amounts to a constrained quadratic optimisation problem: [53]
min
1
n
n·
i=1
? + ??w?2, [15] (26)
where ? is a slack variable, used to remove the minimisation over two variables:
? = max(0, 1? yixTi w) [15] (27)
yi is a points classification with a value of either +1 or -1. yix
T
i w is negative when a point
is classified incorrectly, which also means that ? > 1. No cost is associated to a point where it
sits on the correct side of the hyperplane and beyond the margin, otherwise they are linear in
the distance from the hyperplane.
The most useful property of SVMs for this project is the ability to transform the data, such
that any linear patterns found in the new data space will correspond to a non linear pattern
in the original space, as illustrated in figure 8. This is possible because the problem can be
reformulated in terms of inner products of the data items, which is known as the Ôkernel trickÕ13.
Kernel versions provide several useful features such as that the resulting dimensions are not
dependent on the size of the feature space and therefore can be used on data sets with a large
number of features. A kernel function is specified to transform the data and hence kernel versions
can be used to find complex patterns. This also gives great flexibility with the ability to choose
the most appropriate kernel for a particular problem.

tions 28 and 29 respectively).

(29)
Support vector regression differs slightly from the classification case, as a maximally margin
hyperplane is not used. Alternatively, an -insensitive loss function (equation 30) is used to
minimise the error on the data. An  value is specified which is a threshold distance from the
hyperplane and instances are only said to result in an error if the error value falls outside of this
threshold. Errors within this threshold are small enough and are thus synonymous with a correct
classification and impose no cost. [10] This provides a way of defining an error for regression
problems that allow for some noise. The value chosen as  determines the acceptable error size
and therefore the degree to which the function fits the data. The cost of a point ?, is given by:
? = max(0, |Xw? y| ? ) (30)
The cost therefore depends on the distance from the hyperplane, and these two properties
always hold; ? ³ 0 and ? ³ |Xw? y| ? . A point nearer than  to the hyperplane incurs no cost,
and for those past this point the cost is linear in the distance (and these points constitute the
support vector).
In addition to the loss, a parameter called the cost should also be optimised. This cost
parameter specifies the magnitude of the cost relative to the distance from the hyperplane, where
increasing the cost means the fit will be closer and overfitting may occur. If the cost is too
low the fit is not representative of the data as the penalty for being far from the hyperplane
is too low. The RBF kernel additionally has a gamma value (?2 in equation 28), which is a
regularisation parameter that specifies how closely the fit to the data. The polynomial kernel
requires an exponent parameter (d in equation 29).
In summary, SVMs are a powerful and flexible method for regression problems, in comparison
to standard linear techniques such as least squares. The two objectives, minimising both the
error and the complexity of the hypothesis (called optimisation and regularisation respectively)
means SVMs are able to learn a hypothesis with an inbuilt method to prevent overfitting the
data. They have greater modelling capabilities due to the transformation of the feature space
and hence can find non linear patterns. The appropriate kernel function can be chosen according
to the problem. SVMs cope well with noisy data as they regularise to prevent overfitting and
incorporate a margin to allow for a degree of deviation from the hyperplane. They are less affected
by outliers as the cost function is linear in distance from the hyperplane, compared to quadratic
for least squares.
3.3.8 Bayesian Belief Networks
A Bayesian belief network (BBN) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). BBNs are useful to visualise
the interaction between values, based on the conditional probabilities.
Each node represents one variable and contains a probability table. This states the condi-
tional probability of each value given each value of the nodes that point to it. Each variable is
conditionally independent of the other variables, given the value of its parents (the variables that
lead directly to it).14 [36]
The conditional probability tables are computed using the frequencies of the attribute values
given each of the possible combinations of parent value. This means a variable with 4 nominal
values having a parent with 3 would have 12 different probabilities in itÕs table. Once the network
is constructed, the probability of a set of variable values called the joint probability can be found.
14X is conditionally dependent of Y given Z if where a value of Z is given X is not dependent on Y.
28
We will be able to determine the probability of a certain range of happiness given specific values
of features. The joint probability15 is the product of the conditional probability values of the
variable values in each node. Formally:
P (y1, . . . , yn) =
n¸
i=1
P (yi | Parents(Yi)) (32)
The probabilities can be calculated using the frequencies of the variable values:
P (x = x1|y = y1) = |instancesx1,y1|+ n|instancesy1|+ n áN (33)
This creates a maximum likelihood BBN with respect to the probabilities (and not the struc-
ture). The n and N variables incorporate a Laplace correction into the probabilities to ensure
that no values are ever zero in the probabilities. Data used to construct a BBN is only a small
sample used to represent more general concepts and so zero frequencies may exist in the sample
where the true probability is small but non-zero. Incorporating a correction prevents zero prob-
abilities which would give a large bias such that any joint probability calculated with it will be
zero. The correction effectively assigns each variable value to one extra instance. Therefore in
this case N is |x| á |y|, the number of possible combinations of these two variables, and n is the
weight of this correction. A larger n value will reduce the ÔfreeÕ probability assigned.
Discretization A Bayesian belief network can only use discrete values. Our variables in-
cluding the happiness variable are continuous, and these need to be discretised prior to construct-
ing the network. This involves defining a set of ÔbinsÕ which are categories (a range of values) of
the variables, to convert from continuous to nominal values. Binning can be either equal interval
or equal frequency.[53] Equal interval splits the range into equal sized segments, whereas equal
frequency ensures the same number of elements occur in each bin. The latter is often preferable
as where many elements are clustered around a similar value these values can be segmented to a
finer degree and hence keep more information about the distribution of values.16
This is a possible drawback of BBNÕs where discretising the values will inevitably lose some
information in the data. As an example, consider the following situation:
Instance X : i = 10
Instance Y : i = 11
Instance Z : i = 19
Suppose two bins were for ranges 1-10 and 11-20. X would be assigned a different bin to Y
and Z. Instances X and Y are very close but after discretising it performed it is Y and Z that
appear most similar. The number of bins chosen is important to represent the data most appro-
priately in nominal form, to reduce the amount of information that is lost. If too many or too
few are used then the nominal values do not show some data patterns. Additionally, the degrees
of freedom of a network (the number of changeable parameters) is exponential in the number of
bins. This should be minimised to reduce the complexity and prevent overfitting.
15The joint probability is derived by the chain rule. Generally P (A?B) = P (A | B)P (B). Given 3 nodes with the
following structure: A? B ? C. C is conditionally independent of A given B such that P (C | A?B) = P (C | B).
Therefore:
P (A ?B ? C) = P (C | A ?B)P (A ?B) = P (C | B)P (B | A). (31)
16Weka provides a Bayesian network classifier.[43] All inputs must be discrete, pre-processing is not part of the
tool. [43] Discretising can be done with WekaÕs discretise tool, which provides both binning types described here.
29
Missing values WekaÕs implementation of a BNN handles missing values by assigning them
the mean of the dataset. This is a naive approach and hence it may be preferable to impute the
values before constructing the network.
The following are points to consider when creating a BBN:
¥ The number of nominal values or ÔbinsÕ to choose
¥ Equal interval or equal frequency binning
¥ Preprocessing of missing values (see section 3.1.3)
BBN will provide a useful tool for this project to visualise and assess the relationships between
the variables and happiness label. However, we must be aware that this method does not infer
the direction of causality, but just dependence between variables.
3.3.9 Testing the accuracy of classifiers
Overfitting is a common issue with ML algorithms, and occurs when the learned hypothesis too
closely represents the training data such that it is unable to generalise to unseen examples. This
results in a low error on the training set but a much higher error on the test set. To determine
the accuracy on unseen data the dataset should be split into training and test sets. This can
often be problematic when there is limited data available.
With regards to this project, ideally survey data and feature variables from multiple years
would be used, to provide independent sets of data on which to train and test. However, this
is unlikely as there is limited data available. Alternatively, methods exist to work with separate
training and test sets, such as 10 fold cross validation. This makes best use of the data available
by testing the algorithms multiple times on the same dataset. The dataset is divided into 10
parts, and the algorithm is run 10 times. Each time 9 parts are combined and used for training
the learner and 1 is used for testing. In this way the training and test sets are distinct and the
accuracy can be assessed with 10 different tests.

4 Survey Data Analysis
There are several sources of survey responses with a question on life satisfaction. This analysis
investigates the correlation between the survey data with two aims. Firstly, to ensure survey
data is a reliable and representative measure of happiness. This can be shown where the data
from independent surveys have a high degree of correlation. Secondly, analysis of the data will
provide information in order to decide the best choice of happiness label.
The surveys are correlated using the corrcoef function in Matlab, which also provides p-values
but under the assumption that the data has a multivariate normal distribution. However, the
histograms of figure 10 show that this is not always the case and therefore permutation testing
(see section 3.3.3) may provide more reliable results.
CorrelationCorrelate
Survey 1
Survey 2
Figure 9: Survey analysis test design
Figure 9 shows the test design performed. Permu-
tation testing is performed to find a threshold value
above which the correlations are significant. The null
hypothesis states that the correlation found between
two surveys is likely to be found in the random case.
The threshold is found for each pair of values because
each survey has a unique probability distribution (the
distributions shown in figure 10 are mostly quite differ-
ent).
Eight surveys were analysed, which were carried out on or around 2008 (details in ta-
ble 28,Appendix A), and this includes 4 global, 3 European and 1 Latin American survey. Prior
to analysis the data was transformed to a consistent scale of 0 - 10 (for details see the ÔStandard-
isationÕ column in table 28).
The descriptions in table 28 show several differences between the surveys. These can be
summarised as:
¥ Respondent age
¥ Question
¥ Answer scale
¥ Countries surveyed
¥ Year
¥ Sample size
¥ Position of question in survey
¥ Sample methods
Table 1 details the sample size of each survey. The coverage varies largely and is an important
consideration in choice of ground truth. Patterns found in larger samples are more reliable as
small samples are less robust to anomalies and outliers and any patterns are more likely to occur
by chance.

4.1 Results
The histograms in figure 10 show some interesting distributions. Two of the global surveys have
approximately normal distributions. A normal distribution may be expected because we would
expect many countries to have average LS values and fewer to have extreme values. It may be
tempting to apply the central limit theorem (CLT) here which states that the mean of a large
number of random variables will be normally distributed. Our country LS values can be thought
of as the mean value of random variables (the LS of each recipient in the country). However, the
CLT only holds under the assumption that the random variables are independent and identically
distributed, and this is certainly not true in this instance.
The HPI data has a larger variance than the WVS data. This may be because of the position
of the question in the survey, as discussed in section 2.4.1. The Gallup life satisfaction question is
after governmental and economic questions and this may cause the rich and poor to give higher
and lower life satisfaction values respectively.

Figure 10: Survey data correlations & distributions
The two types of OECD data do not show a normal distribution, and in particular the Positive
Experience Index (OECD POS in column/row 3) shows two clusters centred around 2.5 and 7.0.
It is unclear why there is such a clear split for this survey. This measure is very different from
the others, as it is a compiled index created from OECD consisting of data from six questions
related to what they call Ôpositive experiencesÕ. However, the answer scale was still 0 - 10 and a
unimodal distribution was expected.
The distribution of Gallup life satisfaction (LS) and Gallup ladder of life (LOL) questions
show the latter has a larger variance with lower values also. This is unexpected as we would
expect the LOL questions to give higher values because the question is relative to ones situation;
Ôbest possible life for meÕ rather than Ôbest possible lifeÕ for the LS question. The upper bound of
onesÕ attainable happiness decreases with decreasing life satisfaction, as the standard of life that
is reachable also decreases.
The results show a high degree of correlation between the data, shown in figure 10. Table 2
shows the correlation values for each survey, and the p-values output from the corrcoef function.
Each pair of surveys has a different number of countries in common and the p-value incorporates
a correction to account for this. The significant p-values are highlighted indicating 20 survey
cross-correlations are significant compared with just 4 that are not. 3 of these are for this OECD
Positive Experience Index with the anomalous distribution discussed above. 4 results give no
value where there is no overlap between the countries covered.
Permutation tests gave similar results, shown in table 3. A 1 value denotes a significant
result, such that the surveys were significantly more correlated than the random case. The main
differences are with regards to correlations involving the OECD surveys, and this is consistent

with the distributions which are not Gaussian. WVS, HPI(Gallup) and EVS all show Gaussian
distributions and the results for these in tables 2 and 3 are highly similar. It is interesting to
see how the correlation thresholds of the permutation testing results vary. Correlations involving
surveys with smaller sample sizes need to be very high in order to be significant, because good
correlations are more likely to occur purely by chance for smaller datasets. For instance, the
thresholds of the two largest and two smallest surveys are 0.258 and 0.971 respectively.
The results found above and the survey coverage are used to establish the best choice of life
satisfaction ground truth. The unusual distribution of the OECD POS survey leads us to discard
this data source as a potential label. The LOL data is a small sample and much of the data
missing is for countries having lower values for the LS question. In a country listing, ranked by
Gallup LS value 26 countries (with LS values between 2.4 and 4.9) precede South Africa, which
has the lowest LOL value of 2.05 (and having a LS value of 5.0). This adds further anomaly to
our findings, as the LOL results have a lower minimum without the countries at the lower end
of the scale. The close correlation of LS and LOL data indicates that if LOL did have values for
these countries this would decrease the lower bound of LOL values further.
This indicates two reasons why we should discard LOL as a happiness label. Firstly, we do
not find it appropriate to use a measure that anchors responses by attainable life satisfaction.
Secondly, the OECD LOL dataset is much smaller and lacking values for countries at the lower
end of the scale. Previous research has shown the sensitivity of analysis when using smaller
samples. Furthermore, we will discard the three European and the Latin American dataset, as
we prefer to use global data. This gives us two happiness labels to use; WVS and Gallup LS.
These have very strong correlations to each other with p ? value < 0.0001 (or equivalently a
significance threshold of 0.258 with a high correlation of 0.79). However, there are fundamental
differences in survey methods which mean one cannot simply be preferred to the other.
In conclusion, these results are very encouraging. The independent surveys have very strong
and often significant correlations showing that survey data can provide a consistent measure
of happiness. The HPI (Gallup) and WVS data have been selected as appropriate happiness
labels, to be used in parallel throughout the study. These will be referred to as GAL and WVS
throughout this report.

5.1 Feature Collection & Construction
Previous work (such as that described in section 2.5.3) has highlighted the importance of ensuring
the variables used are representative of the intended notion. Locating sources that give appro-
priate representations of particular concepts, and there is difficulty locating good data sources
with enough coverage.
Where required, features are constructed from the available data. For instance, to represent
gender labour equality a ratio was created from the individual variables of male and female labour
participation rates. Also, latitude is used to represent light. This variable was also adjusted using
the population of cities in a country, to ensure the latitude was most representative of the location
of the population in the country.

Table 7: Ranking significant results (by
p-value)
The features and labels were correlated, and the Pear-
sonÕs r and p values are shown in tables 5 and 6 re-
spectively. A significant correlation can be seen be-
tween many of the features and labels. This is to be
expected and is a challenge of this research; finding
informative and stable models where the variables are
highly dependent.
Table 7 shows a ranking of features that are signif-
icantly correlated with the two surveys. Highlighted
are the variables significant to all. All the features
found to be significant for WVS were also significant
for GAL. The p-values are lower for GAL, which is
likely to be because it is a larger study.
This initial analysis highlights potential differ-
ences in the two labels. The ranking are in differ-
ent orderings, and it is particularly surprising that
GAL correlates better with some of the features than
it does with WVS. The potential causes of the dif-
ferences in happiness labels are discussed in sec-
tion 2.
GDP-growth is shown to be significantly and negatively correlated with both labels. This
is consistent with previous work on the subject. This is very encouraging as evidence of the
unsuitability of GDP as a measure of success of a country.
GDP-growth has a significant negative correlation with LS
GDP-per-capita is however strongly and positively correlated, which is expected, as a degree
of wealth is necessary to enable other variables to occur. This is shown in figure 11(a) and
figure 11(b)), and highlights an important difference in coverage between the two surveys, where
WVS is particularly sparse at lower happiness / GDP values.
GDP-growth, life-expectancy, mortality-rate and population-urban are more
significantly correlated than GDP-per-capita with at least one label
Four health indicators were used and all were found to be significant; 3 for WVS and 4 for
GAL. Mortality rate (% under fives) was not significant for WVS, which perhaps corresponds
to the fact that this variable relates to poverty and WVS lacks data for many of the developing
countries (see figure 11(b) for graph of happiness vs GDP). Figure 26(a) shows that countries
with a lower LS have a much greater variance of mortality-rate.
Life-expectancy was strongly correlated with both surveys, ranked 2nd and 1st for WVS
and GAL respectively. This is particularly apparent for GAL having a correlation of 0.83
(p = 3.68 ? 10?29), and this can be clearly seen in figure 26(b). Life expectancy has a higher
correlation than health expenditure with LS, which is intuitive as it is more directly related to
LS. A person is likely to be less concerned about their countries health expenditure than the
quality of the health care it produces.

Figure 12: Life expectancy vs LS
Life expectancy was strongly correlated with b th surveys
C02-emissions and mammals-threatened are strongly and positively correlated with LS. How-
ever this may be because they are strongly related to GDP per capita. C02-emissions is signifi-
cantly correlated with both GDP-growth and employment, negatively and positively respectively.
In fact, it is more strongly correlated with GDP growth (p = 1.21? 10?17) than it is to WVS (p
= 0.01) and Gallup (p = 2.21 ? 10?12). The fact that it is more strongly correlated with GAL
than WVS is also consistent with this as GAL has a stronger correlation with GDP-per-capita
than WVS.
Variables may appear good indicators of LS due to confounding with GDP per
capita
These correlations use a simple linear correlation but have given a useful insight into potential
indicators. However, it is likely that nonlinear relationships exist, and investigations and methods
in the following sections will look at both linear and nonlinear relationships.

5.3 PCA
PCA is a useful method to uncover patterns in the data (see section 3.1.2 for details). PCA was
performed on the feature set and figure 14 shows principal component (PC) 1 against PC2. These
are the directions with the greatest variance in the data, where PC2 is the direction of greatest
variance that is not accounted for by PC1. A threshold value of PC1 (approximately 0 because
the data is centered) splits the data set such that either side shows a similar but opposed effect
of a change in value of PC1.
The convex shape shows two sets of countries (at near the maximum value of PC2) where they
have very different values for PC1 but the same values for PC2. There looks to be an interesting
split of countries (the colors represent geographical proximity) between African with PC1 = -4
and European PC1 = +4 (approximately).

Table 8: Principal component results
PC1 and PC2 account for 99% of the variance (77 and 22 % respectively) and the coefficient
values are shown in table 8. The individual features are correlated against the PCs to indicate
the dominant features that constitutes each PC. PC1 correlates significantly with 18 of the 22
variables, the very low p-values such as for population-over-65, life-expectancy and pupil-teacher-
ratio. PC2 however shows high coefficients for both gender-labour-ratio and proportion-women-
parliament (both representing gender equality), and these are the only variables with a higher
correlation for PC2 than PC1. This indicates that gender equality is not linearly (and positively)
correlated with variables which can generally be thought of as representing living standards
(GDP, health, education etc). Countries with average living standards such as Egypt tend to
have poor gender equality, and increasing or decreasing GDP etc corresponds to an increase in
gender equality.
The feature set includes latitude (light) and hence perhaps this is grouping the countries
together. Removing the light feature and a highly similar graph is produced.
The correlation of GDP-per-capita with gender equality variables
gender-labour-ratio and proportion-women-parliament is negative and positive
either side of a GDP threshold value

A note on representing equality The gender equality variables are naturally convex
in the sense that inequality can exist where the minority is either males or females. However in
reality the data is such that the women are almost always in the minority. Only the gender-labour-
ratio of Rwanda and Burundi and proportion-women-parliament of Rwanda ÔfavourÕ women. We
manipulate the data such that the variables truly represent equality. Gender-labour-ratio is
changed to a value between 0 and 1, where 1 represents perfect equality:
V arnew = 1? abs(varold ? 1) (34)
The proportion-women-parliament was originally a % and this is changed to a value between
0 and 50, where 50 represents perfect equality (Since only Rwanda has a value above 50 this
amounts to just changing this value from 56.3 to 43.7):
V arnew = 50? abs(varold ? 50) (35)
Data subset R (gend-lab-ratio) P (gend-lab-ratio) R (prop-wom-parl) P (prop-wom-parl)

GDP > 1.9973? 103 0.3823 0.0004 0.4666 9.9377? 10?6

LS(GAL) > 6.7 0.2885 0.0834 0.4727 0.0031
Table 9: GDP-per-capita vs gender equality (gender-labour-ratio and proportion-women-
parliament)
To further investigate equality the data was split into two subsets to correlate these with
GDP-per-capita and LS separately. The split was done using EgyptÕs GDP value (1.9973? 103)
41
and LS value (6.7) respectively as this country sits at the bottom of the convex relationship
shown in figure 14. The results, shown in table 9, clearly show two different correlations for these
subsets. 5 are significant at the 0.05 level and a further 2 at the 0.1 level with signs consistent
with the PCA results.
The question is whether this is equality or inequality of a different form. For instance, is
the female/male labour ratio ÔbetterÕ for low GDP countries because they have no choice but
to work in order to survive, in contrast to countries with better conditions where they are more
comfortable and in effect have the choice of inequality. However, this reasoning is less appropriate
for proportion-women-parliament and we cannot suggest a possible reason for a convex correlation
of this feature. Investigating this is beyond the scope of this project, but this demonstrates the
complexities of the semantics and relationships of these variables.
Figure 15 shows the correlations of labels against principal components. The GAL correlations
are expected, having a linear and convex correlation for PC1 and PC2 respectively. LS is strongly
and linearly correlated with many of the variables and as such the correlation with PC1 is linear.
The WVS correlations are less clear because the sample is small. A convex relationship with PC2
is not clear because WVS does not have many countries with low LS values and so in effect may
only be showing the upper portion of this relationship. The remaining PCÕs account for very
little of the variance and so are not considered here.
The correlation of LS (GAL) with gender equality variables gender-labour-ratio
and proportion-women-parliament is convex (negative and positive either side of
a LS threshold value)

6 Data Preparation
6.1 Imputation
Many of the features have at least some missing values (see table 13.3). Particularly pupil-
teacher ratio has 30 missing values and so it is important to keep the error as low as possible.
The following section details work to attempt to impute the missing values with minimal error.
This involves firstly testing the imputation to investigate how to minimise the error.
The KNN method is used because previous work has shown that this method performs better
than mean values (see section 3.1.4). There are two aspects affecting the effectiveness of KNN,
the value of K and also the subset of features used to impute each variable. KNN is affected by
irrelevant attributes and therefore we will expect that a subset of relevant variables (specific for
each feature) will give the lowest imputation error. A test script was used to test the imputation
of each feature for each value of k (see pseudocode of algorithm 1). The experiment was first run
on the whole feature set and then repeated using our knowledge of the variables to restrict the
features used to impute each feature.
Table 10 shows the results, and table 11 shows a sample of results for imputing GDP-growth
and income-distribution using various subsets. The RMSE is used to compare error results of a
single feature, whereas the average error is preferred to compare results between features because
they use a variable number of tests and the RMSE is relative to this. These results show that
the error can be reduced by removing irrelevant attributes.

6.1.1 Imputation summary
We need the data to be as accurate as possible and KNN has obvious shortcomings to impute
values of features. After imputing and visualising the results it is clear some errors may be
quite large. We therefore opt to improve the data by completing some missing data values
using alternative sources, to minimise the number of values that need imputing using KNN. The
remaining features were imputed using the optimum K (feature specific) and a subset of features
where this was found to give better inference during testing. This was done in a stepwise fashion
starting with the features with the fewest variables missing such that latter imputations could
use more features to infer the values. This is an area of concern, as independent data sources can
have differences due to collection methods. However, the number of missing values is very small
and so this will have a limited impact on the data.
Imputation with KNN did not give consistently low errors and therefore it was
preferred to instead find alternative reliable data sources where possible
6.2 Transformations
The relationship of each feature with the labels was assessed visually (Figure 13), to find any
clear nonlinear correlations, as these could be transformed to a linear relationship to use in our
investigations. This is beneficial as we use several linear methods and additionally decision trees
which have linear decision boundaries.
It can be seen that the population density of Hong Kong is an outlier by Hong KongÕs
extremely high population, and therefore these were re-plotted excluding Hong Kong to assess
the correlation (shown in figure 16), but these show no obvious relationship however.

Figure 16: Population-density with Hong Kong removed
The following 4 variables were found to have non linear relationships: GDP-per-capita health-
expenditure, population-over-65 and C02-emissions. The transformations are shown in figure 17(a)
and figure 17(b). A new feature set was created using the logs of these 4 variables18. The transfor-
mations are used in conjunction with the standards features, as we will be using feature selection
techniques which will enable the learner to choose itself which is more indicative.
18A value of zero has a log value of -Inf, and so this was altered to log(1? 10?7) to solve the problem of dealing
with this

7 Models to Predict Life Satisfaction
The aim of this section is to answer an initial question: Can LS be predicted using a feature set
without GDP growth? More formally, the aim is to find a feature set such that the results of
tests with and without GDP do not show a significantly worse result. This involves performing
tests both with and without GDP and statistically comparing the results.
The main economic variable is GDP-per-capita. However, there are others that are likely to
be representations of this variable also, and these are also removed. This is somewhat subjective
depending on how directly they are felt to represent the intended concept to provide beneficial
information in results, rather than a confounder for economic success. As an example, C02-
emissions is closely related to industry and thus GDP, and hence finding that this variable helps
to predict LS would likely mean that it confounds with GDP. Confounding is a big issue in this
work, and for our next feature set (section 9) we will choose variables more carefully to attempt
to avoid these problems. The variables removed are; GDP-growth, GDP-per-capita, population-
growth, population-density, and C02-emissions. The choice of potentially confounding variables is
selected cautiously, such that a larger set is preferred. This only makes our results more rigorous
as a smaller feature set is less likely to be predictive than one also containing these features.
Three methods are used to investigate the predictive power of this feature set; decision trees,
least squares, and lasso. 10 fold cross validation was used and a t-test (see section 3.3.2) performed
on the correlations of the folds. The algorithm for DTÕs and least squares involve standard CV,
but the lasso method is a little more involved.

Using lasso Lasso is a regularisation method and
hence the regularisation parameter (?) needs to be op-
timised. This should be done for each test, rather
than the dataset as a whole as it is specific to the
data given to lasso. The pseudocode is shown in algo-
rithm 2, and figure 18 shows how the error varies with
? value, where the optimum ? value minimises the er-
ror on the test set. Sub-optimal ? values either con-
strain lasso too much such that it cannot model the pat-
terns in the data, or not enough such that overfitting oc-

7.1 Results and Analysis
Decision Trees Model trees are used (see section 3.3.6) where each leaf has a regression
model. This means that all trees generated are smaller as some of the data patterns are accounted
for in the leaf models. The trees constructed including GDP (for both labels) consisted of a single
node with a regression model. This infers that labels can best be explained by simply using a
linear model rather than a decision tree structure.
The trees constructed when excluding economic variables are shown in figure 19. The trees
have 3 and 2 leaf nodes respectively, splitting on health variables; health-expenditure and life-
expectancy. This indicates the possibility of a more complex relationship between the features
and labels. Subspaces of the attribute space are represented using separate models at the leaves.
We will not analyse the coefficients of the linear models as they may contain sets of dependent
variables and hence are likely to be unstable.

7.2 Statistical Methods
Table 12 shows the results of 10 fold cross validation using the three methods with and with-
out GDP-per-capita. The models give different correlation values. A t-test is used to test the
statistical significance of the difference between the results, for each method/label. The t-test
compares the cross validation results to determine if these are likely to have come from the same
distribution. The null hypothesis states that the difference between the results sets has a mean
of zero, and hence a statistically significant t-test result indicates that the two result sets are
significantly difference. Therefore, we aim to show that the results are comparable such that H0
is not rejected (or the feature set excluding GDP-per-capita performs better and H0 is rejected).

7.2.1 Conclusions
Table 12 shows there is no significant difference (p < 0.05) between the results when removing
economic type variables, for 5 of the 6 tests performed. This is very encouraging, as we are using
just 15 variables to predict LS and are able to do this without a significant difference when GDP
is removed. Its interesting to note that the correlation values of these tests are very similar, and
in 4 of these tests actually increases with GDP-per-capita removed (although this difference is
not significant). Additionally, it is likely that other variables that may be effective in a model to
predict happiness and these will be included later.
Result: Feature sets excluding economic variables are able to predict LS as well
as GDP-per-capita
48
8 Feature Selection (1)
We have shown that LS can be inferred when using a feature set excluding GDP. We now investi-
gate which features in particular are key in these models. Two approaches are used for this; lasso
and least squares regression. Permutation tests using bootstrapping are used to determine the
significance of the results. This work amounts to a pattern discovery problem, where the patterns
are feature subsets or individual features. Therefore the size of the pattern space is all possible
patterns considered. There are 17 features (15 features plus 2 log versions) and hence the pattern
spaces are 217 for feature subsets and 17 for individual features. Significance of results is assessed
using permutation testing to provide a threshold test statistic t? (see section 3.3.3) such that:
p(T ³ t?) ² 0.05 (36)
where T is the test statistic on permuted data.
8.1 Lasso Feature Selection
Lasso19 finds a subset that gives a good correlation, but where there are several dependent
variables lasso results are inherently unstable as small changes in the data set supplied to the
learner can affect the variables chosen in the model. This is because when several variables have
very similar relationships with the labels the learner chooses the best to include in the model,
and repeating this on different data can cause the learner to select a different feature each time.
Therefore performing lasso on different bootstrapped data subsets results in a set of models.
Although the coefficient values are unlikely to be the same, often the same subset of features are
used (the coefficients of the same feature set have not been reduced to zero). Therefore tests
must be performed many times to improve the stability of the results, by finding frequent exact
subsets.
Lasso is used here to find both dominant subsets of features and also individual features. To
discover important feature sets we aim to identify key exact subsets where they are produced
significantly often by lasso, which will indicate relationships between variables to predict LS.
The number of features is constrained to 6 in these tests20, as we are interested in small
predictive subsets of features. Although the correlations will be slightly reduced it is still very
comparable to when not constraining (in fact some of the models produced when not constraining
the model size are < 6)21. A t-test of constrained (< 6) against unconstrained gave p-values of
0.6914 and 0.9077 for GAL and WVS respectively, showing the results are comparable.
The lasso tests aim to answer three questions. These are all based on a test method involving
bootstrapping 100 times, and returning an individual feature or feature subset and a test statistic
using the results of the bootstraps. Three questions are posed:
1. Are there feature subsets that are generated frequently by lasso? We will call this frequency
the vote.
H0: The most frequent subset generated is no more frequent than the most frequent
subset found on random data
Pattern: Feature subset
Output: Most voted (exact) subset.
Test statistic: Vote of most voted subset
19glmnet Matlab library was used
20default setting is numFeatures + 1
21The models are also constrained to > 0 features, which is necessary because in permutation tests where there
is no correlation between (random)label and features lasso often prefers a model with no features (just a bias), but
we are interested in the best model containing at least 1 feature
49
2. Are the most voted subsets significantly correlated with the label? When permuting the
label is a correlation greater than this likely?
H0: Lasso models generated using the most frequent subset are no more correlated
with LS than with random labels
Pattern: Feature subset
Output: Most voted (exact) subset.
Test statistic: Correlation value
3. Is the highest feature frequency in the bootstrap models likely to occur by chance?
H0: The most frequent feature is no more frequent than the most frequent found with
random data
Pattern: Individual feature
Output: Most frequent feature
Test statistic: Feature frequency: number of bootstraps it occurs in (rather than the
number of unique feature sets)
Methodology Figure 20 shows the test design and the three test statistics corresponding
to the questions specified above. 100 bootstraps are performed and the 3 test statistics and
variables are output. In actuality a sorted listing is returned to provide more information, sorted
by test statistic so the significance threshold can be used to assess models that are lower in this
ordering. For instance, if the second result is greater than the threshold then it can also be
deemed significant.

We can define the most frequent subset as:
f? = argmaxf?F (vote(B, f)), (37)
(38)
and then formally the test statistics are as follows:
T1 = vote(f
?) (39)
T2 = correlation(f
?) (40)
T3 = maxf?F (frequency(B, f)) (41)
where F and B are the set of features and bootstraps respectively, and
vote(B, f) = #b ? B : (lasso(b) = f) (42)
50
The significance thresholds t? are found with permutation testing. The test (figure 20) is
repeated many times with permuted labels, giving a set of T values. The value of T where it is
greater than 95% of these is the significance threshold (with p = 0.05):
0.05 ³ #p ? P : T (Bp) ³ t?
#p ? P , (43)
where P is the set of permutations, such that under H0:
p(T (B) ³ t?) ² 0.05 (44)
Results: Feature Subsets Tables 13 and 14 show the most voted subsets in 100 boot-
straps. Permutation testing found significance thresholds for T1 of 7 for both labels. 3 significant
models were found for GAL but none for WVS. The GAL significant subsets always contained
log-health-expenditure, income-distribution, health-expenditure and 2 of either mortality-rate,
gender-labour-ratio, and proportion-women-parliament.
All GAL significant feature subsets contained: log-health-expenditure,
income-distribution and health-expenditure
mortality-rate, gender-labour-ratio, and proportion-women-parliament were each
found in 2 of the 3 significant GAL subsets
Lasso with WVS generated few repeated subsets with 88 different subsets for 100 bootstraps.
Compared with GAL these results are much more unstable and this may be because WVS has
a smaller less varied sample of countries. The most voted model is however quite prominent
with a vote of 5 in comparison to votes of 1 or 2 for all other subsets found. This model con-
tains: life-expectancy, child-immunization, log-health-expenditure, mammal-threatened, income-
distribution, and health-expenditure.
The most voted WVS model also contains the three features found in all
significant GAL models: log-health-expenditure, income-distribution and
health-expenditure
The significance thresholds for correlations of the most voted subsets (T2) were 0.3284 and
0.4369 for GAL and WVS respectively. The correlations of all subsets were higher and thus
significant, with mean correlations of 0.8620 (GAL) and 0.7660 (WVS).
All subsets found are significantly predictive of LS (compared to random case)
Results: Individual Features Tables 13 and 14 show the feature frequencies in the models
generated by lasso in the 100 bootstraps. A conservative approach to discarding features is taken
due to the high dependency between variables. For instance, given two variables v1 and v2 that
are part of a feature set on which lasso is performed, and where v1 ? v2. Due to the random
selection of instances in the bootstraps and the small differences between v1 and v2 we can expect
that their vote will be shared approximately equally between them. Hence the votes of each are
reduced and this could potentially cause two significant variables to fall outside of the significant
range.

Therefore, in addition to the 95%
threshold we also take a 5% threshold to
find features that are significantly infre-
quent, to aid us in discarding irrelevant
features. The two thresholds help assess
features with high correlation and depen-
dencies, as illustrated in figure 21. A min-
imum threshold value will help us discard
those features that have significantly little
contribution to the models, such that the
coefficient is often reduced to zero (signifi-
cantly more often than the random case).
Table 15 shows these three types of re-
sults.

Table 15: Feature significance in lasso models: significantly infrequent (7), intermediate (-) and

7 features are significantly infrequent for both labels and can be discarded from the feature
set (if both surveys find them infrequent). 3 are significantly frequent for at least one label; life-
expectancy, log-health-expenditure and income-distribution. Log-health-expenditure dominates
the results, used in all models for GAL and 97% for WVS. GAL and WVS have some different
results. They both have two significant features but the second differs, being child-immunisation
and income-distribution for GAL and WVS respectively (the survey not finding significance also
did not find the feature significantly infrequent either and so this is not a big inconsistency).
52
Significantly frequent features: life-expectancy, log-health-expenditure,
income-distribution
Notable features: employment, mortality-rate, mammals-threatened,
gender-labour-ratio, proportion-women-parliament, population-growth,
health-expenditure
Significantly infrequent features: child-immunisation, time-start-business,
pupil-teacher-ratio, light, homicide, log-population-over-65, population-over-65
The results indicate a set of core features present consistently in the models, and
others that are interchangeable and hence often present
Sample Models We can gain some insight from these generated models, and the type of
contribution of each feature, indicated by the sign and size of the coefficient values. Examples
equations 45 and 46 show two models for the top ranked subsets of GAL and WVS respectively.
LSGAL = 0.7815 + 0.7232 life? expectancy + 0.1569 log ? health? expenditure ? 0.1143 mortality ? rate
?0.1588 gender ? labour ? ratio + 0.2694 income? distribution + 0.3291 health? expenditure (45)
LSWV S = 2.5259 + 0.1902 life? expectancy + 0.0906 child? immunisation + 0.3218 log ? health? expenditure
+ 0.1525 mammals? threatened + 0.4660 income? distribution + 0.1968 health? expenditure
(46)
All health variables included in the models have an intuitive sign. For instance, mortality-rate
has a negative coefficient because mortality rate is negatively correlated with LS. However, the
remaining variables show unexpected coefficients with respect to the concept each is representing.
These variables are income-distribution, gender-labour-ratio and mammals-threatened.
The income-distribution coefficient is positive indicating a higher value is associated with
higher LS. However, this is unexpected because high income-distribution means greater inequality
of income. At first thought, this may be due to confounding with GDP but the initial correlations
are not consistent with this. LS is correlated strongly and positively with GDP but GDP is
correlated negatively with income-distribution.
In fact, work by Verme [50] details how previous results of the relationship between LS and
relative income have been inconsistent, finding both negative and positive correlations. It is noted
how the type of data might affect the results such as using small datasets, particular noting cross-
country studies. Hence, perhaps income-distribution may be more appropriate as an indicator
when people are entities and the relationship between LS and income equality can be directly
analysed. One suggested explanation of a positive coefficient is the affect of relative income on
social mobility.[50] A greater degree of income inequality relates to more potential to Ôclimb the
ladderÕ, to have ambition and progress in life, which improves LS.
The variable mammals-threatened contributes positively to the WVS model. However, with
hindsight it is unclear what this variable is representing and therefore will be discarded. A higher
gender-labour-ratio value corresponds with a more equal gender employment, but the GAL model
includes gender-labour-ratio with a small but negative coefficient. However, we showed with PCA
analysis in section 5.3 that gender equality has a convex correlation with life satisfaction and
therefore this may be the reason why the coefficient is not intuitive.
53
The unexpected coefficients highlight the restrictions of a linear model. Although the model
has a high correlation it is constructed in a way which is contradictory to previous work and our
own intuition. Lasso is an effective method for generating models, but these models are still only
simple linear models and this is limiting. Further analysis with decision trees will be useful to
investigate non linear patterns in the data.
Some features (e.g. mammals-threatened) have unexpected coefficients and one
possible cause is confounding with economic success (GDP-per-capita)
8.2 Least Squares Leave One Feature Out
We use least squares to provide an independent alternative approach to finding key features, by
analysing the effect on correlation values when removing a feature in turn from the feature set.

Figure 22: Least squares test design
Methodology Figure 22 shows the test design where the difference in correlation is cal-
culated for each bootstrap with and without each feature. These values are averaged for each
feature, and the features are output, ranked by average reduction of correlation. The first feature
therefore causes the biggest reduction in correlation when removed from the feature set. The test
statistic is the average correlation difference:
T = maxf?F (av(f)), (47)
where function av computes the average difference for a feature over all bootstraps. The signif-
icance threshold t? (with p = 0.05) is found by performing the test many times with permuted
labels and finding T such that 95% of the results on random data give a smaller test statistic.
Results Tables 23(a) and 24(a) show the results of these tests, with the features ranked by
test statistic. The permutation tests found significance thresholds of 0.0592 and 0.0571 for GAL
and WVS respectively. Therefore, the results are not significant compared to the random case.
However this is likely to be because the features are highly related and thus removing one feature
and another feature can in effect represent much of the variance of the removed variable.
Tables 23(b) and 24(b) show t-test results of comparisons between the set of bootstrap outputs
of each feature. This shows most are significant indicating the feature rankings found have
significant differences between the results of each feature (such that the ranking is stable and not

trivial). For example, log-health-expenditure is the first ranked feature and on removal caused a
reduction of correlation significantly different from the other variables.
log-health-expenditure is the top ranked feature for both labels, causing a
significantly larger reduction in correlation if excluded
8.3 Lasso / Least Squares Results Comparison
Feature selection using lasso and least squares has found some similar results. Firstly the features
found to be significant with lasso are near the top of the least squares rankings. In particular
log-health-expenditure is ranked first for both labels. Income-distribution was ranked second and
third in least squares and was present in 0.64 and 0.9 of the lasso models, for GAL and WVS
respectively. Life-expectancy is ranked fourth and eighth which is consistent with the lasso results
where this variable was found in 1.0 and 0.59 of lasso models for GAL and WVS respectively.
55
Both tests find log-health-expenditure, income-distribution and life-expectancy to
be important features
With respect to the highly infrequent features in the lassoÕs model, least squares also found
population-over-65 to be very infrequent.
population-over-65 has been found significantly less important than the other
features in predicting LS
8.4 Results Summary
LS predictors Health variables have shown particular prominence in the results, partic-
ularly health-expenditure and life-expectancy. These variables were key in tests of all three
methods, and were the only variables used as internal nodes in the decision trees. Health expen-
diture is quite a general term and therefore this is now removed from the feature set as more
direct notions of health care quality are preferred.
The variables proportion-women-parliament and gender-labour-ratio, which were intended to
represent gender equality, were present in the significant feature subsets of the GAL lasso. It is
interesting to note how the top two feature subsets contained one of these, thus perhaps they
represent the same concept and lasso chose between them. This is also consistent with the fact
that these features were neither significantly frequent of significantly infrequent (table 15).
The feature income-distribution was consistently a key component of the models with a pos-
itive coefficient, which infers that income inequality indicates LS. However, the reason for this is
unclear, and previous work has shown conflicting results on this topic.
Methods Lasso and least squared gave some similar results but also many differences. Lasso
is ÔfairerÕ with respect to variable selection (see section 3.3.5) and therefore is more powerful and
informative than the greedy approach of least squares. Least squares provides a useful comparison
for the lasso results but more importance will be given to the lasso results as it is able to cope
with dependent variables better and so is more reliable. The models trees are very short due to
the regression models at the leaves and therefore it may be more informative to use regression
trees. Lasso and least squares are restrictive because they produce linear models, and hence we
will investigate further machine learning approaches to find non linear patterns.
Features discarded The features discarded from this stage and reasons:
¥ health-expenditure, log-health-expenditure: Too general (replaced with more direct health
indicators)
¥ GDP-growth, GDP-per-capita: Economic variables
¥ population-urban, population-density, C02-emissions, mammals-threatened: Likely con-
founding with GDP
¥ population-over-65, log-population-over-65, homicide, light,pupil-teacher-ratio, time-start-
business: Significantly infrequent in lasso tests

Table 16: Feature set 2
The additional features were chosen based on previous research and also the results found so
far. Climate has been found to affect happiness such as work described in section 2. The results
for pupil-teacher-ratio were surprising and hence this is investigated further by using different
education variables. Freedom is an important subject but only one variable, time-start-business,
has been used to represent this which was perhaps not highly representative of freedom. Religious
indicators are also included to represent religious freedom / equality, as well as a generic freedom
index.
Freedom Index [28] We prefer to use primary sources but freedom is very difficult to
quantify, and therefore in this case we use a freedom index22. This is derived from survey
data and covers the following freedom areas; politics, expression and belief, religion, academic,
associational and organizational rights, law and personal. The index values range from 1 to 7
representing highly free and not free respectively, and figure 25 shows the freedom of the world.
Military Expenditure We investigate any relationship of military size with LS. The orig-
inal variable is military expenditure as a percentage of GDP. The models generated included this
feature with negative coefficients. However, this may be due to confounding with GDP. This
variable is investigating the relationship:
?
MilExp
GDP
= LS. (48)
Assuming that MilExp stays constant then ? would be strongly negative because GDP-per-
capita has a strong positive correlation with LS. Therefore, where the covariance with LS of
military expenditure is small compared to that of GDP, using this variable relative to GDP is
in fact just incorporating a measure of GDP in the models, rather than military expenditure as
intended. Therefore this variable is adapted to be relative to health expenditure instead. It can
now be thought of as a measure of the investment in military relative to the investment in health
care. As is shown in the subsequent tests this variable gives different results to the original.

9.2 Initial Analysis and Correlations
The new features (figure 26) do not show many clear relationships on visual inspection. Freedom
appears linear (and negative) but quite ÔfatÕ, with alot of variance at each LS value. Secondary
enrolment does show a linear and positive correlation with LS. The difference between primary and
secondary school enrolment is quite striking, where primary-education-enrolment has much less
variance with LS. Also, the countries with lower LS appear to have greater variance of primary-
education-enrolment, both above and below 100, whereas those with high LS are clustered much
tighter around the mean (100%). These enrolment variables are gross enrolment figures, relative
to the population that officially corresponds to that education level. Hence primary enrolment
may be above 100% for countries of lower LS because there are older members of the population
taking primary level education.

9.3 Finding Significant Features: Decision Trees
Regression trees are used for feature selection to generate larger trees than that of model trees.
REPTree in Weka is used which used reduced error pruning to improve the stability of the tree.
The WVS tree, shown in figure 28 is the same as was generated previously. The GAL tree
(figure 27) however is much larger and uses 6 different features as internal nodes.

9.4 Finding Significant Features: Lasso
Lasso significance tests are repeated using the feature set of table 16. Table 17 shows the sig-
nificance of each feature. 4 features are significant with at least one label, and life-expectancy
is significant for both. Again some of the signs are not consistent with our knowledge of the
features, such as income-distribution.
Significantly frequent: life-expectancy, proportion-women-parliament, freedom,
secondary-education-enrolment
9.5 Assessing Significant Features

Table 17: Lasso results
We compare this subset with GDP-per-capita as done previously using 10 fold cross valida-
tion for lasso and decision trees. This test is comparing a single feature with a subset of features,
hence the latter has a higher VC dimension. This means is can fit the data more closely during
training. The use of 10 fold CV is highly important here where the correlation is calculated on
new test data such that there is no advantage given to the larger feature set. If this feature set
overfits the training data it will perform badly on the test data. 10 sets of tests were performed
to increase the reliability of the results (the folds are randomly chosen each time).

Table 18: Lasso correlations & significance
Table 18 shows the mean correlations and the p-values of t-tests comparing the significant
subset(4) with variations of economic variables. Our feature subset gave significantly higher
correlation than all economic variable sets tested. This was the case for both labels and for both
lasso and DTs.
The feature set {life-expectancy, mortality-rate, proportion-women-parliament,
freedom, secondary-education-enrolment, income-distribution,
primary-education-enrolment} can predict LS significantly better that economic
variables using Lasso and DTs
61
Comparing the lasso correlations with the previous results of table 12, they are marginally
reduced. However, the difference is small and not significant, with p = 0.4451 and 0.2456 for
GAL and WVS respectively. The first feature set contained 17 variables but the one used now
has just 7, which shows some variables used initially contribute a small degree to the predictive
ability of a LS model.
The feature set {life-expectancy, mortality-rate, proportion-women-parliament,
freedom, secondary-education-enrolment, income-distribution,
primary-education-enrolment} can predict LS as well as the 17 original features
The GAL and WVS models are highly consistent. The most frequent model includes the
same features for both labels, and each coefficient has the same sign. There are also similarities
with regard to the coefficient magnitude, such as having large coefficients for life-expectancy
and income-distribution for both labels, although the life-expectancy coefficient seems quite a
bit larger for GAL. This may be due to the sample where GAL has many more poorer coun-
tries with low health care which may make it more sensitive to changes of life expectancy.
Primary-education-enrolment has a negative coefficient and this is quite unexpected, especially
as secondary-education-enrolment uses a positive coefficient.

Table 19: Lasso frequent subsets
Lasso was run again using just the 7 key features
and GAL label in order to find frequent subsets.
There are 7! = 5040 possible subsets. However over
100 bootstraps lasso used just 17. The significance
threshold for subset vote is 13 at a 5% level, and
table 19 show the significant subsets found.
5 features are present in both frequent subsets.
Mortality-rate is not included in either and addi-
tionally itÕs coefficients are not stable as the sign
varies in the results, whereas all other variables are
only ever included with the same sign. The votes
show that the first subset has a much lower p-value,
whereas p ? 0.05 for the second (because the vote
equals the threshold). The only difference is the inclusion of primary-education-enrolment and
this indicates this variable should be included in the model.
Significant features subsets:
{life-expectancy, proportion-women-parliament, income-distribution, freedom,
primary-education-enrolment, secondary-education-enrolment}
{life-expectancy, proportion-women-parliament, income-distribution, freedom,

10 Best Prediction
Linear and nonlinear methods are used to find the optimal prediction of LS. We test with both
the whole feature set (of stage 2) and our key feature set to provide a comparison. The GAL LS
label is used as it provides better coverage, and again 10 fold cross validation is used to prevent
overfitting.
10.1 Optimising SVM
SVMÕs have several parameters that must be optimised for each dataset (See section 7 for more
details). A grid search was used to optimise the loss and cost values. Two kernels were tried;
RBF and poly. RBF is a gaussian kernel and hence the gamma parameter was optimised also.
This was done after the grid search using the optimal loss and cost values, trying gamma values
at 0.5 intervals. This gives a good but non optimal result as the gamma is not optimised in
conjunction with the other parameters. However the optimal correlation was very near to that
found with the original gamma value (that used in the grid search).
10.2 Results
Table 20 shows the p-values of t-tests comparing the results of 10 times 10 fold cross validation.
This was done using linear and nonlinear learners and also using the significant features and
whole feature set to provide comparisons. These show a significantly better correlation for the
key feature set, compared with the whole feature set for both the model tree and SVM. The
lasso predictions did not significantly improve using only the key features, which indicates lasso
is effective at feature selection.
Using key features significantly improved the best prediction found for model
trees and SVMs

Best mean correlation: 0.86 (model tree)
The best correlation was found for model trees with a correlation of 0.86. However, this was
not significantly better than lasso which indicates a highly linear relationship such that LS can
be represented using a linear model.
The relationship between the features and LS is highly linear
Using the large feature set gave significantly worse performance. For instance, a t-test compar-
ing the two feature sets for model trees gave a p-value of 2.1212?10?16. Decision trees naturally
perform features selection, but can still be affected by irrelevant attributes as lower down the tree
63
the number of instances at each node reduces and the chance of choosing an irrelevant attribute
to split the data increases. Also, model trees use a linear model at the leaves which irrelevant
attributes can affect. Lasso appears much more robust to irrelevant features, with no significant
difference in performance between the two feature sets.
Lasso is robust to irrelevant features
10.3 DT & PCA
PCA can be an effective transformation method when using decision trees because the variance
of the principal components are orthogonal to the axes (because the axes are by definition the
direction of highest variance in the data). Decision trees split the data into ÔboxesÕ with boundaries
that are orthogonal to the axes and therefore principal components may be more easily split during
tree construction.

Table 21: PCA decision tree results (10 x 10 fold Correlation)
The key features performed the same as using both principal components and key features
alone. The results of table 21 show that using PCs alone gave significantly worse results. Using
only key features gave the highest mean correlation across the folds. This is not significantly
better (p = 0.0986) than using the combined features, which is expected due to the feature
selection capabilities of trees (where if the PCs do not split the data well they can simply be
ignored). However, the p-value is significant with a 1% level and this again supports the results
of section 10.2 where using only key features improved results.
The correlations of PCs against key features shown in table 22 indicate from which features
the principal components are composed. PC1 is clearly representing health and education, where

Table 22: Correlations of key features against principal components
high values correspond to lower LS, lower life-expectancy, higher mortality-rate, lower secondary-
education-enrolment, better income equality, and lower freedom. The decision tree infers countries
with lower PC1 values have a higher LS. Here income-distribution is related negatively with LS
such that a greater income equality relates with higher LS which differs from our earlier results.
The decision tree also uses PC3. This correlates with income-distribution, proportion-women-
parliament, freedom and primary-education-enrolment. A high PC3 value corresponds with
greater income inequality, lower proportion-women-parliament, higher freedom, and higher primary-
education-enrolment. Income-distribution has the same sign for PC3 and PC1 but these PCs have
opposite relationships with LS. PC3 is used to split those countries with the highest living stan-
dards (according to PC1 and life expectancy), where the lower PC3 values are related to lower LS
for these countries. Therefore, for these countries the decision tree is inferring that more equal
income-distribution relates with lower LS values. This indicates that the relationship between
income-distribution and LS appears to differ when LS reaches a certain level. Income equality
may be important for LS in poorer countries to improve the standards of lives. However once
quality of life reaches a certain level, income inequality may relate positively with LS to provide
opportunities, aspirations and social mobility.

11 Graphical Models
Bayesian networks are described in section 3.3.8. Our aim is to use BBNs to assess the relation-
ships between the key features we have identified.
11.1 Discretizing
Bayesian networks require nominal data and so the data is converted from the original numeric
features. Discretizing using equal width caused some bins to hold very few instances, which may
cause more unreliable results because it is easily affected by each of these instances. Therefore
equal frequency was used to give approximately the same number of instances in each bin in the
network. The bins are slightly different sizes because the number of instances cannot be divided
exactly into 4 bins. Some of the variables have only a small number of values such as freedom
where the values are between 0 and 7 in 0.5 intervals. This means that the number of instances
in the bins is more variable, because of the groups of intervals with identical freedom values.
The number of bins was chosen by experimentation, where the class distribution of the bins
was visually compared. A balance is needed between simplicity and loss of information. A small
number of bins is preferred such that the degree of freedom of the network is kept low. However,
there needs to be a sufficient number of bins to capture relationships between the variables, as
reducing the number of bins reduces the information content of the network. We found 4 bins to
be appropriate (named VLOW, LOW, HIGH, VHIGH respectively).
11.2 Network Structure
There are several methods for automatically generating networks, but these are not able to
infer causality and therefore the network structure is built manually. The probabilities are then
calculated using estimates of the probabilities (see section 3.3.8).
The networks use the key features, and additionally GDP-per-capita is included. Figure 31(a)
shows a basic structure, which we are confident represents the variable relationships. This struc-
ture represents the notion that GDP affects the levels of other variables and these in turn impact
on LS. We investigate some alterations to this basic network, shown in figures 31(b), 31(c) and
31(d). These have one or two additional edges connecting GDP-per-capita to proportion-women-
parliament, freedom and also to LS directly.
11.2.1 Metrics used for assessment
We use % correct, ROC curve area and degrees of freedom to assess the networks, to look at the
performance of each structure.

A 13 1236
B 14 4308
C 14 4308
D 15 16596
Table 23: BBN details
Degrees of Freedom The degrees of
freedom (DF) are the number of parameters
that can change in a model. This is an im-
portant consideration as models with higher
DF are more easily able to fit to a pattern.
The DF of a network is the number of
probabilities in the probability tables of each
node. These are probabilities of each value of
this node conditional on each combination of parent node values. For instance, one probability
of node mortality-rate is p(mortality ? rate = V LOW | LS = V LOW ). The number of values

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves A ROC curve is a graph of false
positive rate against true positive rate. The area underneath (AUC) indicates how well the
test instances are classified. This combines both the rate the class is correctly identified (true
positive) and the extent that instances are classified as this class incorrectly (false positive).

Figure 32: ROC curve (basic
structure low LS)
With respect to this work, a ROC curve is generated for each
band of LS, and figure 32 shows the ROC curve for VLOW LS
and the network in figure 31(a).
Specifically, for a ROC curve of class c and given two ran-
dom instances i1 and i2 where c(i1) = c and c(i2) = Âc, having
p1 = p(c | i1) and p2 = p(c | i2). The AUC corresponds to the
probability that p1 > p2.[21] An instance that is misclassified
but only just such as if p(c | i1) is only slightly smaller than
p(Âc | i1), will reduce the area, but by less than if the difference
in these probabilities is much greater (given that the points of
other classes lie between these values). In this sense this value
can be seen to quantify the distribution of values in a confusion matrix into a single value.
Each ROC curve corresponds to a class value (discretised LS value), and here we use the
average AUC (across LS values) as a measure of how well LS is predicted by each network. A
value of 1 indicates no false positives and 100% true positives (and 0.5 is as good as the random
case). Hence this metric is a useful measure as it indicates class prediction relative to other
23For our network all nodes have 4 values. None: 4, 1 : 42 = 16, 2 : 43 = 64, 3 : 44 = 256, 4 : 45 = 1024, 5 : 46 =

instances, rather than the actual prediction values. [21] Instances ranked in the correct order
(according to the ratio of p(c | i) and p(Âc | i) such that p(c|i)p(Âc|i) is always larger for instances of
class c) will give an optimal AUC, but in this case it is still feasible that the classifications are
incorrect. For instance, if no instances are classified as V LOW but also if the V LOW instances
are ranked higher such that they are more likely to belong to this class than the other instances,
then the ROC curve will be optimal. As such we combine use of this measure with others such
as the % correct to provide an overview of the effectiveness of each network.
In addition, weighted ROC area is assessed. This takes into account the class distribution of
the test instances of each fold24, and this gives more importance to the results of more frequent
classes.
11.2.2 Results
Table 24 shows the affect of structural changes to the original network (figure 31(a)) which
are shown in figures 31(b),31(c) and 31(d). These results compare 10 sets of 10-fold cross-
validation tests (100 result values per network)25. Firstly, the proportion correct is surprisingly
low (approximately 58%). This may be because the numeric data is discretised which loses much
of the information is contains. Confusion matrices shows the magnitude of the errors, such as that
of graph A (table 25) where mistakes of smaller magnitude are more common. For instance, no
countries with an extreme LS value (VLOW or VHIGH) were classified as the opposite extreme
value.

Table 25: Confusion matrix of graph A
The t-test result sets for the 3
measured values are first considered
independently. The % correct was
highest for graph A, although this
was not significant. In fact A and
B showed identical results and no
significant difference was found be-
tween A,B and D. Graph B gave the
largest ROC area, marginally larger
than A. Again, no significant difference between A,B and D. The weighted ROC area results did
however find a significant improvement, for graph D when compared to all other graphs.
Therefore, all three tests showed graph C performs significantly worse than the other network,
with respect to the % correct and weighted and unweighted ROC curve areas. It also has a larger

68
degree of freedom than graph A and hence graph A is preferred for this reason also. With respect
to graphs A,B and D, only weighted ROC curve area gives a significant difference, and this is
in favour of graph D. However with p = 0.0395 for graph A versus graph D this is significant
at a 5% level but not at a 1% significance level. These results are less than definitive, and it is
only when considering model complexity that we prefer one graph over the others. Graph D has
16596 degrees of freedom, which is much larger compared to 1236 of graph A. This means that D
is much more prone to overfitting as there are many more tunable parameters in the model. This
reason leads us to believe it is reasonable to accept graph A as an appropriate graph compared
to the three variations considered. Also, according to OccamÕs razor when two models perform
equally well then the simpler one should be preferred.
A degree of improvement was expected when connecting GDP-per-capita directly with LS.
There are several possible justifications for this representation, firstly that this does indeed show
that GDP-per-capita has a direct impact on LS. Alternatively, this may have occurred if there
are other relationships not captured in our network involving variables we have not considered.
The feature set considered is small compared with the potentially relevant features which may
impact on LS, which is likely to be a large number of variables. Therefore, these results are in
line with our expectations.
Connecting GDP-per-capita directly with LS shows no performance improvement
of the network

12 Data Visualisation
Chernoff faces (CF) are a method for visualisation of multivariate data.[12] Each facial feature
corresponds to a feature in the data set and changes shape or size according to the feature value
(relative to the values of the other data points). Facial expression is closely associated with
happiness and hence LS, and as such it is an ideal representation. Satisfied countries can be
easily identified using facial expression as well as differences between particular facial features,
and hence trends and anomalies are easy to identify. Two star visualisations have been generated
for a comparison (figure 33(c) and 33(d)) and these are clearly much less intuitive.
12.1 Label Value Inference
To maximise the data available, we infer GAL values from the WVS where the GAL values are
missing, by regressing WVS against GAL. The resultant model is
GAL = 0.9525 WV S + 0.1938 with p = 1.4054? 10?10 and a correlation of 0.6287. Therefore
while the overall correlation is good there are some differences which may affect the country order
for the two labels.
12.2 Face Generation
The faces for each country are shown in figure 27 and these results are ordered by LS such that
the trends can be identified. Table 26 shows the key for the face features, chosen such that
high LS relates to happier looking faces. For example, eyebrow angle is used to represent gender
equality and hence proportion-women-parliament was negated such that angry eyes relates to
poor equality.
Face feature Data feature Visual meaning
Face size life-expectancy large = high
Length of nose mortality-rate large = high
Eyebrow angle proportion-women-parliament unhappy = unequal
Eye: dist between income-distribution close = equal
Forehead shape freedom round = more free
Shape of jaw primary-education-enrolment round = high
Smile secondary-education-enrolment smile = high

Figure 33: Chernoff and star exam-
ples
The similarities and differences are easily recognisable,
now the features are represented visually. For example,
two countries having very low and high LS values are Zim-
babwe and Norway respectively, shown in figures 33(a)
and 33(b). These show very different values for each fea-
ture. However we can see that primary education rate is
very similar (shape of jaw line). Even though ZimbabweÕs
primary enrolment is high, the secondary enrolment is
very low (sad smile). This highlights our findings that
secondary education is more predictive of LS than pri-
mary education.
Health was shown to significantly predict LS and our
CFs show this with both increasing face size (life ex-
pectancy) and decreasing nose size (mortality rate).

12.3 Interactive Results
A website26 was built to provide an interactive visualisation of the results. The core technologies
used are: Google maps, Google visualisations, HTML, JavaScript and JSON. The Chernoff faces
were overlayed onto a map such that the LS and feature values can be easily analysed by global
location. The standard map pointers are replaced with faces, which when clicked display charts
of the feature values for this country next to the map (see figure 36). There is also a separate
page where the correlations between features can be viewed where on mouse over the country
details are displayed.

13 Project Conclusions
Drawing conclusions It is important to first note the extent to which conclusions can be
drawn from our results. We have found key features and models to represent and predict LS.
However, justifying these results with common sense reasoning has limited worth as demonstrated
by Paul Lazarsfield, a mathematician and Professor of Sociology. [2] Lazarsfield switched findings
of military research looking at the stress of soldiers. The research found that education was
positively related to the stress a soldier experiences, which could be justified by environmental
differences such that farmers are more used to the tough conditions. However when switching
the result, he showed that this could just as easily be justified by another reason, that education
provides skills to cope with stress. This shows how we should only be guided by results rather
than our intuition and common sense. [32]
13.1 Results Summary
13.1.1 Feature selection & construction
Variables were constructed such that they were most representative of the intended concept. For
instance, latitude was used to represent light, and this was weighted by population to ensure it
was representative of where people actually live.
Military expenditure was initially found to be significant. However, this variable was the
amount relative to GDP per capita. Confounding was found to be the underlying reason for
itÕs inclusion. This was determined by altering the variable to military expenditure per health
expenditure, after which it was no longer found to be a significant feature (see section 9.1).
We found much sensitivity to choice of variable to represent a concept. For example, several
education indicators were considered; primary enrolment, secondary enrolment, literacy rate and
pupil teacher ratio. Literacy rate and pupil teacher ratio were not significant features, but the
enrolment variables (particularly secondary) were prominent in the results.
Visualising the data indicated some variables have an exponential relationship with LS. Trans-
forming these with logs was found to be beneficial, where these variables were often selected
instead of the original (section 6.2).
13.1.2 Key features & feature subsets
The key features identified are:
¥ Health: life-expectancy, mortality-rate
¥ Education: primary-education-enrolment, secondary-education-enrolment
¥ Equality: proportion-women-parliament*, income-distribution
¥ Freedom: freedom index
* Additionally, PCA found an interesting relationship between gender equality and both LS
and GDP per capita (section 5.3).
Although mortality rate was found to be significant as an individual feature, it was not present
in the significant feature subsets. The following frequent subsets were found using lasso tests:
{life-expectancy, proportion-women-parliament, income-distribution, freedom, primary-education-
enrolment, secondary-education-enrolment}
{life-expectancy, proportion-women-parliament, income-distribution, freedom, secondary-education-
enrolment}
73
13.1.3 Key Models
Tests have shown that our models using the key features are significantly more predictive of LS
than economic variables alone (section 7 and section 9.5). The best correlation used was 0.86
for model trees. There was no significant different between the results of linear and nonlinear
methods, indicating the relationship of our feature set with LS is highly linear (section 10). A
regression tree for the GAL label is shown in figure 37.

Figure 37: Decision tree: Key features & GAL label (not standardised)
The models generated using lasso and least squares consist of coefficient values that were often
against intuition. For instance, primary education enrolment has a small negative coefficient. This
is to be expected as only using a small number of features are used and thus this is only a ÔgoodÕ
but less than perfect model of life satisfaction. Therefore some compromises are built into the
generated models to account for this as best as possible.
13.1.4 Graphical Models
Tests with Bayes networks investigated slight variations and found no significant improvement
in prediction when connecting GDP per capita directly with life satisfaction. Additionally, the
performance was poor with a mean prediction of 59 %. This is likely to be due to discretisation
where to keep the degrees of freedom low a small number of ÔbucketsÕ was used, which causes
much of the information in the data to be lost.
13.1.5 Consistency of results & data quality
Tests results for WVS and GAL found some similar results but also some differences. For instance,
models for WVS preferred freedom whereas proportion-women-parliament was used for GAL. Life
expectancy however was a consistently significant feature throughout this work for both labels.
The availability of a suitable ground truth is a constraint of this project, where there are
differences between the sources that are not ideal (see section 4). In brief, WVS is too small
and missing many countries with low LS, whilst GAL is larger but possibly skewed by question
positioning. Additionally, the variables used as features included some missing values and these
were inferred. This involved both using alternative sources and also imputation using the k-
nearest neighbour method. Imputation (section 6.1) did not give good results and was used only
where reliable alternative sources could not be found. The reliability of alternative sources is a
concern, as small differences between the sources can affect the data. Therefore, future work in
this area will improve with better data availability and coverage.

13.1.6 Results visualisations
Chernoff faces provide an effective visualisation of our key feature set. They have shown to be
an excellent method to visualise multivariate data where patterns and anomalies can be easily
identified. Facial expression was a particularly appropriate and intuitive representation for this
work, corresponding to life satisfaction.
13.2 Assessing progress
The main objective was to predict happiness using a feature set excluding economic variables.
Results surpassed expectations, having identified a feature set significantly more predictive than
economic variables. Structural tests that identified no direct relationship between GDP and life
satisfaction further support the notion proposed: ÒEconomic factors are not goals in themselves
but a means for acquiring other types of social goalsÓ. [25]
We have proven GDP to be inadequate as a measure of progress and shown the opportunity
and value of an alternative concise but highly informative variable set. GDP by definition27
is driven by consumption, but this is not the case for our feature set. Therefore, a measure of
progress incorporating these could help lead us to a happier, more sustainable and planet friendly
future.
13.3 Areas of further work
Our work found an interesting relationship between gender equality and GDP / life satisfaction
and this needs further investigation. The two variables represent gender equality only (labour
participation and equality in parliament), and hence more equality variables needs investigating
to look at other types of equality.
An interesting area of future work would be to learn using more structured data to allow
information that cannot easily be expressed in typical attribute value learners. For instance,
Tilde is an ILP learning system able to learn decision trees (including regression) using first
order logic. This may be of much use to investigate relationships and structure in the world
such as political allies and country neighbours. Our results indicate close relationships between
countries, such as the PCA graph (figure 14) where nearby countries have similar values of some
variables. It would be interesting to investigate the extent to which a countryÕs LS is determined
by their own actions or heavily constrained by other properties such as the countries they border.
Finally, the relationship between income distribution and LS is an open question, and the
uncertainty behind this is highlighted by our conflicting results regarding this. The constraining
factor regarding research into this is the lack of available data.
27Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the value of the goods and services produced by a country in a year.
Formally, GDP is: The sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes
and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. [1]
