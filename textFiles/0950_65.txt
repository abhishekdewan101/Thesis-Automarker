Summary
In hard knapsack problem, all known polynomial time algorithms fail to
break. There are two algorthms called Schroeppel-Shamir and Howgrave-
GrahamJoux (HGJ) that can solve hard knapsacks in exponential time. Al-
though, in paper [17], balanced knapsack problem has been fully discussed, it
does not cover unbalanced case too much. Hence, in this dissertation, I will
focus on unbalanced case by analyzing complexity. To support my analysis,
I will implement experiment to demonstrate its correctness. Moreover, some
extension and improvement strategies are also discussed.
In this dissertation, several works has been done:
1. Analyze the time and memory complexity of priority queue and modu-
lar version Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm. See section 5.1.1 and 6.1
2. Discuss the time complexity if using early abort strategy. See page 30 and 39
2. Point out an error in original priority queue 4-way merge algorithm and
come up with an modified version of algorithm. See page 31.
3. Implement experiments both modified and original version to see running
time and correctness. See page 33.
4. Analyze and implement experiment to show that the best value of parameter
M in modular 4-way merge algorithm is the same as the input list size. See
page 40.
5. Present parallel version of modular Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm and simple
HGJ algorithm. See page 37 and 47.
6. Fully discuss the complexity of HGJ. See section 7.1. Implement experi-
ments to demonstrate the correctness of analysis. See page 51.

1 Introduction
0-1 knapsack problem which is also called subset sum problem (SSP) is a special kind
of knapsack problem. 0-1 knapsack problem as a famous NP-hard problem interests
both theoreticians and practitioners. It also has numerous applications. To cite one
example, to allocate task to parallel independent machines with setup times gives rise
to a 01 integer program. In this program, its coefficient reduction problem can be
seen as a subset sum problem [1]. More importantly, since this problem is easy to
compute in one direction but hard to calculate in inverse direction, subset sum prob-
lem can be a very useful cryptographic tool. In fact, a number of cryptosystems are
constructed on the basis of hardness of subset sum problem, such as Merkle-Hellman
public key cryptosystem [4], Impagliazzo and NaorÕs cryptographic schemes [8] which
is as secure as the subset sum problem and more recently, GentryÕs fully homomor-
phic scheme [22] [2] [25]. NTRU cryptosystem can also be reduced to an unblanced,
approximate modular vector knapsack.
1.1 Problem Description
In the broad sense, knapsack problem can be regarded as an optimization problem.
Namely, under the constraint of capability of the knapsack, to find a subset from
given items whose value or objective function is the greatest. However, in cryptog-
raphy, to find the greatest value or a value close to the target sum is meaningless.
Cryptographers care which subset sums up to exact given target sum. In this paper,
the definition in the cryptography will be used.
More precisely, the subset sum problem or 0-1 knapsack problem is that
Given 1. a vector A which consist of a set of positive and pairwise different inte-
gers, i.e.
A = (a1, a2, . . . , an), ai 6= aj, if i 6= j
In this paper, we call this vector A as knapsack vector and any ai as elements in
knapsack vector.
And given 2. A positive integer s, called the target or target sum.
Then the goal of the problem is to find a subset A? = (a?1, . . . , a
?
l) of A which satisfies
s =
·
a?1,...,a
?
l?A?
a?i (1)
We define the subset we are looking for (i.e. satisfying Equation (1)) as answer
subset.
5
Or equivalently, if we define another n-dimensional vector X = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) with
values of xi in {0, 1}, subset sum problem then converts into finding a vector X
satisfying
s = AX =
n·
i=1
xiai, xi ? {0, 1} for all i (2)
In other words, xi means whether ai is in the answer subset which sum up to target
s. If xi equal to 0, ai is in the subset. If 1, ai is not in the subset.
We call vector X as indices vector. Similar with the difinition of answer sub-
set, we call indices vector represents the answer subset which sum up to target s as
answer indices vector or solution.
We call a given problem with a knapsack vector and a corresponding target sum
as a knapsack. Please note that, even though the elements in the knapsack vector
and target sum of two knapsacks are same, if the elements arrange in different order,
they are different knapsacks.
If we consider the target sum s as the capability of a knapsack and ai as volume
of an items, then subset sum problem can be considered as given a list of items how
to fill a knapsack exactly with some collection of those items. That is why we call it
knapsack problem.
1.2 Classification of Subset Sum Problem
The subset sum problem is in the complexity class NP. There are two forms of
knapsack problems. One is decision knapsack problem, where one should determine
whether there exists an answer subset for a given knapsack. The second form is
the computational knapsack problem. One should try to find out the solution. The
decision problem and the computational problem are equivalent within polynomial
factors. If decision knapsack problem can be solved efficiently by an algorithm or
oracle, one can also compute computational knapsack problem by calling n round of
the oracle- i.e. if we want to know the answer subset of a n-dimensional knapsack
A = (a1, a2, . . . , an), we can ask the oracle whether there exists a solution of the
(n-1)-dimensional subknapsack whose knapsack vector is A? = (a1, a2, . . . , an?1). If
there exists, xn equals to 1, else xn equals to 0. If one repeats asking existence from
n? 1 to 0, one can find all the value of xi. The decision problem is NP-complete [3]
and the corresponding computational problem is NP-hard. Since, general speaking,
there is no polynomial time algorithm for the problem in the complexity class NP,
repeating oracle n-times will not effect the time comlexity.
According to Impagliazzo and Naor [8], knapsack problems can also be classified
6
in terms of their density, which is defined as:
d =
n
log2(maxi ai)
When d < 1, usually, there is only a unique solution for a given target s, therefore,
this set of integers can be used for encryption. When d > 1, most target sum s will
have many preimages which makes these sets can be used for hashing scheme. It
is proved by Impagliazzo citeImpagliazzo, when the density is close to 1, it is the
hardest case of subset sum problem. So this case is informally called hard knapsack
problem.
1.3 Subset sum based cryptosystem
Subset sum based cryptosystems are one of the earlist public key scheme, which was
believed to be very hard to break, since its security relies on the hardness of a classi-
cal NP-complete problem. But in fact, it turns out that almost all subset sum based
system is shown to be insecure.
The basic idea of subset sum based cryptosystems is that there are two sets of in-
tegers. In one set of integers, subset sum problem can be solved easily, whereas,
in the other set, it can be solved hardly. There is a trap door behind these two
sets, making these two sets are equivalent to each other when solving subset sum
problem. Certainly, no one except decryptor owning the secret key can find out the
link between these two sets. So when encrypting, one can use the hard set as pub-
lic key and get the ciphertext in the form of sum s. When the decryptor gets the
ciphertext, he can use easy set as secret key to recover the message from target sum s.
The first and most famous subset sum based scheme was introduced by Merkle and
Hellman [4] in 1978. Merkle-HellmanÕs public key cryptosystem tries to hide superin-
creasing knapsack problem as an easy one into general knapsack problem. But unfor-
tunately, a polynomial time attack method come up from Shamir [5] in the spring of
1982 announced the fall of singly-iterated Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem using lattice
reduction. After that, a number of other knapsack based cryptosystems were broken
due to lattice reduction, too. In addition to the attacks on specific knapsack systems,
a low-density attack introduced by Lagarias and Odlyzko [6] and later improved by
Coster [7] provide a very ideal choice to break subset sum based system. In fact,
even Lagarias-Odlyzko low-density attack is solving shortest vector problem (SVP)
in lattices which is NP-hard for randomized reduction shown by Ajtai [9]. But due to
lattices reduction algorithm such as LLL [10] or the BKZ algorithm of Schnorr [11],
in practice, Lagarias-Odlyzko low-density attack works very well when the density
d < 0.64. After that, the knapsack cryptosystems with density d < 0.94 are proved
to be insecure after the attack from [7] [12] [13]. On the other hand, a similar attack
proposed by Joux and Granboulan [14] which tries to find collision is efficient (mildly
7
exponential time O(2n/1000)) to break knapsack based hash-function with d > 1.
However, there is no a quite efficient way to break the system whose density close to
1 which is so-called hard knapsack problem. In fact, Impagliazzo and Naor [8] proved
that the density 1 is the hardest knapsack problem. Before 2009, the known best
algorithm for hard knapsack problem was an brute force algorithm called Schroeppel
and Shamir algorithm [15] [16]. Schroeppel and Shamir algorithm is improved on
the base of birthday algorithm. Its running time is O(n ? 2n/2) and memory in bits
is O(n ? 2n/4). If using O÷ representation (i.e. O(g(n) ? log(g(n))i) is represented as
O÷(g(n)), since g(n) is much larger than log(g(n))i thus dominates the running time),
the time and memory complexity of Schroeppel and Shamir algorithm is O÷(2n/2) and
O÷(2n/4) respectively. In this dissertation, we will always use this notation.
At Eurocrypt 2010, Howgrave-Graham and Joux introduced a more efficient algo-
rithm [17] for hard knapsacks. While in Schroeppel-Shamir Algorithm, two lists
are constructed implicitly so as to searching collisions in two lists without overlap,
Howgrave-GrahamJoux algorithm (HGJ algorithm) divides original knapsack prob-
lem into several subknapsacks with overlap, which allows more freedom. Thus, it
lowers the running time down to O÷(20.3113n) and space requirement down to O÷(20.256n)
for almost all knapsacks of density 1.
1.4 Security of subset sum based cryptosystem
Since almost all subset sum based cryptosystems have been shown to be insecure, the
major question about subset sum based cryptosystems has always concerned their se-
curity. From a high level to analyze subset sum based cryptosystems, there is a doubt
asked frequently which also applies to the RSA as well, ÒWhat if P = NP , somebody
comes up with a wonderful new algorithm that solves all problems in NP efficiently?Ó
Even if we put this cliche aside and admit that P 6= NP , why most instances of the
knapsack problem can be solved easily? In fact, the so-called NP-completeness prob-
lem deals with the worst-case situation, which only means that there is no a efficient
way to be bound to find the answer. In other words, NP-completeness is indepen-
dent to the truth that many NP-complete problems are easy to solve on average [19].
Moreover, most these cryptosystems are not pure subset sum problem, since there is
a trap door behind the public hard knapsack problem and the private easy knapsack
problem.
Besides the general doubt that worries public key cryptosystem metioned above,
another cause for suspicion is caused by a result of Brassard [20]. On the very ab-
stract level, it says that if the problem of breaking a cryptosystem is NP-hard then
NP = CoNP , where CoNP is the complement of NP . That means when facing a
cryptosystem like Merkle-Hellman scheme, the only way to break is to come up with
8
an algorithm which will solve any subset sum problem. However, if NP 6= CoNP ,
there should be an attack on these cryptosystems which takes much less time than
the algorithms that break subset sum problem.
There is a more specific suspicion about the security of subset sum based cryptosys-
tems Ñ the linearity of such schemes, namely,
·n
i=1 xiai+
·n
i=1 yiai =
·n
i=1(xi+yi)ai.
For instance, supposing that not all the ai are even, by observing the last bit of cipher-
text (i.e. the target sum s) we can know whether there is at least an even integer in
the plaintext subset. Although, this is such a bit of information about plaintext that
it does not even reavel a single bit of plaintext and there is no attack found is based
on this linearity, it may lead to defect in its security since linearity in cryptosystems
is known to be dangerous.
Anyway,though the security of the subset sum based system are often suspected,
subset sum problem is a NP-hard problem after all. We have reason to believe that
subset sum based cryptosystems have the potential to be secure if it is designed per-
fectly.
1.5 Advantages of subset sum based cryptosystem
The main attractive feature of knapsack cryptosystems including Merkle-Hellman
knapsack cryptosystems is the speed, which is often the drawback of most public key
scyptosystems.. Symmetric encryption system, such as the Data Encryption Stan-
dard (DES), When implemented on the dedicated chip, its encryption speed can be
up to tens of milions of bits per second. Even if it is only used in the appropriate size
of the software, it can still encrypts at the rate of 100000 bits per second. The RSA
system is often criticized for its low speed. In the case moduling at a size about 500
bits, even the speed of the fastest dedicated chip can only be 104 or 2 ? 104 bits per
second. If implemented by software, the speed is as low as 100 bits per second. In
other words, the RSA encryption is 100 or 1000 times slower than that of traditional
symmetric encryption.
The subset sum based cryptosystems seem to provide a possibility with a higher
speed compared with other public key systems. Taking Merkle-Hellman subset sum
cryptosystem as an example, with parameter n Å 100 (which is an appropriate value,
Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem seemed to be 100 times faster than RSA
with modulus of about 500 bits [21] at the time it was introduced. Either used in
software or chips, although the speed of subset sum based scheme still does not ex-
ceed the speed of symmetric encryption system, it is much faster than general public
key scheme. This is because the number (200 bits) in the Merkle-Hellman knapsack
cryptosystem is smaller than that in RSA (500 bits) and moreover, there is only one
modular multiplication in Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem. Though, there is
a slight disadvantage in that twice the communication capacity is needed which means
9
the size of plaintext will be expanded twice in ciphertext and the size of the public
key is larger (when n Å 100, the key size for Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem
is 20,000, compared with 1000 bits for RSA with modulus of about 500 bits).
1.6 Variant of Knapsack Problem
1.6.1 Modular knapsack problem
Similar with the original definition of knapsack problem, modular knapsack problem
is given a modulus M , knapsack vector A = (a1, a2, . . . , an) where ai ? {0,M ? 1}
and a target sum s, looking for answer subset. Namely, find a indices vector X =
(x1, x2, . . . , xn) that can be written as
s mod M = AX mod M =
n·
i=1
xiai mod M
Actually, the knapsack problem defined over integers is equivalent to modular knap-
sack problem, in exponential time algorithm. Any algorithm that can solve integer
knapsack problem can be used to solve the modular knapsack problem, and vice versa.
Obviously ,in one direction, given an algorithm that can solve modular knapsack
problem, when modulus M is large enough, modular knapsack problem will be ex-
actly the same as integer knapsack problem. More precisely, to solve integer knapsack
problem, one input modular knapsack algorithm with modulus M , original knapsack
vector and original target sum, where M satisfies M ³ max(s,·ni=1 ai) + 1. Thus,
integer knapsack problem transforms into a modular knapsack problem with a huge
M which leads to whether modular M will not effect the numbers in the problem.
In the other direction, assuming that knapsack vector A and the target sum M
is represented in the range [0,M ? 1], then all the possible sums are in the range of
[0, nM ? 1]. Hence, in modular knapsack problem, if all the possible target sum is
representd in integer, it will be s, s+M, . . . , s+ (n? 1)M . If given an agorithm that
can solve integer knapsack problem, by repeating calling integer knapsack algorithm
n times with target sum s, s+M, . . . , s+ (n? 1)M , modular knapsack problem will
be solved. As before, n times iteration will not effect the time complexity of a expo-
nential time algorithm.
1.6.2 Random knapsacks
Given the length of knapsack vector and prescribed density D, random knapsack
problem is that all n elements in knapsack vector A is generated in random and
10
the density of knapsack basically meet the prescribed density D. Random knapsack
problem is constructed as follow:
Algorithm 1:Random kanpsacks problem generator
Input:
n: the number of elements in knapsacks
D: prescribed density
Create vector a and vector x
for i from 0 to n-1
pick a[i] uniformly random in the range of [1, b2n/Dc]
pick x[i] uniformly random in the range of [0, 1]
if x[i]==1
s=s+a[i]
end if
end for
output:
a: knapsack vector
x: answer indices vector
s: target sum
Note that there is some probability that the actual density d of knapsack is big-
ger than prescribed density D. However, as n increases, the probability that d and
D are different will be gradually reduced. Finally, when n tends to infinity, the two
values become arbitrarily close with overwhelming probability. When the problem is
generated by the algorithm described above, Coster et al. solved all random knapsack
problem with prescribed desity D < 0.94 [7] using lattice based algorithm.
1.6.3 Unbalanced knapsack problem
The hamming weight (abbreviated as weight) stands for how many values in a vector
is non-zero. The hamming weight of indices vector is often denoted as l. Formally,
hamming weight of indices vector l is defined as l =
·n
i=1 xi. Thus, the hamming
weight of answer indices vector in random knapsack problem may be the arbitrary
value in the range of [0, n]. But when n is big enough, we generally believe that l is
n/2. For the reason that the hamming weight l greatly effects the density that can
be applied by lattice reduction attack [7] [6], it is natrual to come up with the idea of
knapsack problem with different hamming weight which is defined as ?-unbalanced
knapsack problem.The value of ? is defined as ? = l/n. ?-unbalanced knapsack
11
problem can be constructed as follow:
Algorithm 2:?-unbalanced kanpsacks problem generator
Input:
n: the number of elements in knapsacks
D: prescribed density
?:proportion of the value that equals to 1, in answer indices vector
Create vector a and vector x
let l be b?nc
while the weight of x doenÕt equal to l
generate a random a
for i from 0 to n-1
pick a[i] uniformly random in the range of [1, b2n/Dc]
if x[i]==1
s=s+a[i]
end if
end for
output:
a: knapsack vector
x: answer indices vector
s: target sum
Even though a well balanced knapsack with exactly half zeros and ones in knap-
sack vector, we can use the notation of ?-unbalanced knapsack as well and call it
1/2Ðunbalanced knapsack.
1.6.4 Complementary knapsacks
Given a knapsack problem with knapsack vector A = (a1, a2, . . . , an) and target sum
s, trying to find answer indices vector X = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) is equivalent to solve its
complementary knapsack problem which is
given:
original knapsack vector A = (a1, a2, . . . , an)
new target sum s? =
·n
i=1 ai ? s
to find:
answer indices vector X ? = (x?1, x
?
2, . . . , x
?
n)
12
Since s = AX and s? =
·n
i=1 ai ? s = A?X, s + s? =
·n
i=1 ai. Thus, these two
answer indices vectors suffices
For all i : xi + x
?
i = 1
In other words, to solve original knapsack problem, one can first solve its complemen-
tary knapsack problem. Then using 1?x?i to recover the answer indices vector of the
original problem.
Moreover, if we denote l? as the hamming weight of complementary kanpsack prob-
lem, l and l? satisfy the relation l + l? = n. In other words, if original knapsack
is a ?-unbalanced knapsack problem, then the complementary knapsack would be a
(1??)-unbalanced knapsack problem. Therefore, when we solve any knapsack prob-
lem, we can always assume the hamming weight of answer indices vector l ² bn/2c.
1.7 Aims of dissertation
As we described above, for hard knapsack problem, there are 2 generic algorithms.
One is Schroeppel and Shamir algorithm and the other one is HGJ algorithm. These
two algorithms are both exponential time algorithm. In original paper of HGJ algo-
rithm [17], the balanced case of knapsack problem has been discusses in detail, but
it only outlined the unbalanced case briefly. The aim of this dissertation is to fully
analyze time and memory complexity of 2 algorithms in unbalanced case. If possible,
try to extend the application and come up with some strategy to improve algorithms.
1.8 Dissertation structure
First, in section 3 we will introduce Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm and HGJ algorithm
by outlining their processes and giving a short analysis in balanced case. Next, in
section 4, we will show how to adapt Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm and HGJ algo-
rithm into unbalanced case by rearranging knapsack vector. This rearrangement is
important for our analysis, which helps to reduce the size of list in algorthms and
thus meet bound of complexity. Since HGJ algorithm is constructed on the base
of Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm, our analysis starts from original Schroeppel-Shamir
algorithm. In section 5, complexity of priority queue Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm
is discussed in brief. Whereas, we find and correct an error in original algorithm,
which will not effect the result in general case. Then in section 6, we will analyze the
complexity of modular Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm and best choice of modulus M .
A parallel version of modular Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm is also presented in this
13
section. Then we will discuss simple version of HGJ algorithm in detail including its
complexity, a parallel version and experiment result. Finally, this dissertation will
end with evaluation and possible improvements.

2 Binomial coefficient
In this dissertation, binomial coefficient will be used frequently. Binomial coefficient
or combination is a possibility of picking several items out of a larger group, where
(unlike permutations) order does not matter. More formally, binomial coefficient(
n
l
)
is the number of subset of l elements out of a n elements set. Presented in
mathematical formula is(
n
l
)
=
n!
l!  (n? l)! =
n(n? 1) . . . (n? k + 1)
k(k ? 1) . . . 1
In convenience of the computation of complexity, we will often use asymptotic ap-
proximation for binomials. First, we should be familiar with Stirling formula, which
is
ln n! = nln n? n+O(log(n))
After simple computation
n! = (1 + o(1))
Ã
2pin(
n

)n
Following the idea when we compute complexity, we will focus on the part which
dominates the size of number. Hence, given a value ? in the range of [0, 1],
(
n
?n
)
(or
(
n

) can be represented as
(
n

If we want to present in the form of O÷(2cn), we should compute c by using the
logarithm in basis 2 of numbers coming from asymptotic estimates of binomials.

3 Generic algorithms
3.1 Schroeppel and Shamir algorithm
Schroeppel and Shamir introduced their algorithm to break a generic integer knap-
sack problem in paper [15] and [16]. The Schroeppel and Shamir algorithm can solve
n-elements subset sum problem in exponential time O÷(2n/2) with space complexity
O÷(2n/4).
This algorithm is evolved from birthday algorithm of Horowitz and Sahni [26], which
can be used to attack such a subset sum problem as well. Recalling the subset sum
problem formula (2) in section 1.1, if we rewrite formula (2) by moving half of knap-
sack vector (i.e. {a1, . . . , abn/2c}) into left hand side of equation, we will have basic
birthday algorithm of subset sum problem
bn/2c·
i=1
xiai = s?
n·
i=bn/2c+1
xiai (4)
where all the xi should be either 0 or 1. Thus, to implement basic birthday algo-
rithm, we should construct two sets List(1) and List(2) and then search for collisions
between these two sets. List(1) contains all possible sums of first bn/2c elements,
whereas List(2) contains the possible value that s subtracts all possible sums of other
elments. If collision occurrs (i.e. there are a {x1, . . . , xbn/2c} and a {xbn/2c, . . . , xn}
satisfies equation (4)), it must be a answer for this subset sum problem. If we go
through all possible sum, all the solution in this subset sum problem will be found.
The time complexity and space complexity of this algorithm are both O÷(2n/2) in-
cluding computing all possible values of two sets, sorting two sets and searching for
collisions.
Instead of generating the full sets List(1) and List(2), Schroeppel and Shamir al-
gorithm uses priority queues (based either on heaps or a Adelson-Velsky and Landis
trees) to store possible values in two sets, which reduces memory requirement to
O÷(2n/4).
More specifically, denoting q1 = bn/4c, q2 = bn/2c, q3 = b3n/4c. Then Schroep-
pel and Shamir algorithm constructs 4 sets List
(1)
L , List
(1)
R , List
(2)
L , List
(2)
R whose sizes
are O(2n/4). These 4 sets are defined as follows:
List
(1)
L stores all possible pairs of (
·q1
i=1 xiai) and its corresponding (x1, . . . , xq1) where
xi ? {0, 1}.
List
(1)
R stores all possible pairs of (
·q2
i=q1+1
xiai) and its corresponding (xq1+1, . . . , xq2)
where xi ? {0, 1}.
List
(2)
L stores all possible pairs of (
·q3
i=q2+1
xiai) and its corresponding (xq2+1, . . . , xq3)
16
where xi ? {0, 1}.
List
(2)
R stores all possible pairs of (
·n
i=q3+1
xiai) and its corresponding (xq3+1, . . . , xn)
where xi ? {0, 1}.
Hence, subset sum problem becomes searching elements in List
(1)
L , List
(1)
R , List
(2)
L ,
List
(2)
R , which satifies s = List
(1)
L [i] +List
(1)
R [j] +List
(2)
L [k] +List
(2)
R [l], which is called
4-way merge problem.
Then original 4-way merge routine first sorts List
(1)
R and List
(2)
R in increasing or-
der. There are two priority queues, initialized by all List
(1)
L [i] + List
(1)
R [0] and s ?
List
(2)
L [i]?List(2)R [n? q3], respectively. Compare the first value in two queue. If these
two value are not equal, the next value in List
(1)
L + List
(1)
R or s ? List(2)L ? List(2)R is
inserted into corresponding queue. In other words, by sorting two times, a priority
queue outputs the next smallest in set List(1) or List(2). If the output of two priority
queues are same, these two outputs must be a solution to this subset sum problem.
The complete description can be found in oringinal paper [15].
Here, we use the outline version described in [17] and show the algorithm proce-
dure as follow:

In Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm, to compute all possible sum and insert them into
4 lists will take O÷(2n/4) time. In original 4-way merge algorithm, if the worst case
happen, it will take O÷(2n/2) to traverse in List(1) and List(2). So the overall running
time is O÷(2n/4 +2n/2) = O÷(2n/2). When memory is concerned, storing all possible sum
in 4 quarters require 4? O÷(2n/4) = O÷(2n/4). Since every time an element is added into
Queue1 or Queue2, algorithm will pop an element in corresponding queue. So the size
of queues is the same compared with the size when the two queues were initialized.
Since the initial size of two queues are O÷(2n/4), the overall memory requirement of
original 4-way merge algorithm would be 2? O÷(2n/4) = O÷(2n/4). Combining the space
complexity of Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm and its subroutine algorithm, it would be
O÷(2n/4).
3.2 Modular 4-way merge algorithm
However, in the original 4-way merge algorithm, it requires sophisticated data struc-
ture such as priority queue, which is difficult to implement and hard to optimize. In
fact, as size of the knapsack n increase, the list size will also increase exponentially,
which takes risk of crash in cache and results in extra memory overhead.
In order to overcome these drawback, A simpler but heuristic variant of 4-way merge
algorithm is introduced in [17]. Since the list List(1) and List(2) constructed im-
plictly is sorted by the value of modulus, we call it modular 4-way merge algorithm.
It should be emphasized that, from the perspective of theoretical analysis, modular
4-way merge algorith is not better than original one. The time complexity of modular
4-way merge algorithm is the same as original one. Whereas, modular 4-way merge
algorithm may require more memory.
The basic idea under this algorithm is that first pick a modulus M . Letting ?

tively, then the condition to apply 4-way merge algorithm become ?

Satisfying
?M = ?
(1)
L + ?
(1)
R ( mod M) = S ? ?(2)L ? ?(2)R ( mod M) (5)
19
But, there is no useful condition to guess the correct vaule of ?M . So only we can do
is keep trying all possible vaule of ?M , until a ?M suffices equation (5). Specifically,
the process of modular 4-way merge algorithm is shown in the follow

(1)
R = ?M ? ?(1)L
in List
(1)
R (M). In fact, by using this method, List(1) constructed in original meet-in-
the-middle algorithm is divided into M small lists.
Similarly, when searching the collision for the value s ? ?M , a List(2)(M) is con-
structed impictly to divide List(2) into M disjoint sets. Then for each possible value
of ?
(2)
L , algorithm searchs s??M??(2)L in the sorted List(2)R (M). Once collision occur,
final step is to test whether their sum equals target s without modulo.
As explained in section 3.1, the time and space required to build up List

R is O÷(2
n/4). Letting M be 2n/4, the expected size of List(1)(?M) and
List(2)(?M) would be O÷(2
n/4) (although it can not be guaranteed). For the rea-
son that algorithm should guess the correct value of ?M , algorithm will test all
?M in worst case. Since M is a n/4 bit value, trying every ?M will contribute
O÷(2n/4) to time complexity, which will result in the total running time becoming
O÷(2n/4) ? O÷(2n/4) = O÷(2n/2).
Because algorithm requires to store List

List(2)(?M) all of which sizes are O÷(2

3.3 The Howgrave-GrahamJoux Algorithm
First, letÕs recall our basic knapsack formula:
s = AX =
n·
i=1
xiai, xi ? {0, 1} for all i
In section 1.6, we have explianed that we can always assume the hamming weight of
answer indices vector l =
·n
i=1 xi ² bn/2c, by solving complementary knapsack if
needed. In order to facilitate analysis, we further assume that the size of knapsack n
is a multiple of four.
21
The main idea of HGJ algorithm is to transform original big problem into 2 smaller
sub-knapsack problems with the same knapsack vector A, but different hamming
weight l/2, different target sum ?1 and ?2. The target sums of these two sub-knapsack
problems suffice s = ?1 + ?2. Formally, we construct two sub-knapsack problems
?1 = AY =
n·
i=1
yiai and ?2 = AZ =
n·
i=1
ziai (6)
where
s = ?1 + ?2
under the constraint { ·n
i=1 yi = l/2, yi ? {0, 1} for all i·n
i=1 zi = l/2, zi ? {0, 1} for all i
As long as 2 answer indices vectors does not overlap, obiviously, if we add two vectors
Y and Z, we can thereby obtain our solution X. In other words, if we represent any
xi in the form of (yi, zi), then xi = 0 can be represented as (0, 0) and xi = 1 can
be represented as (0, 1) or (1, 0), whereas a (1, 1) is not a legal status which causes
overlaping in xi. Namely, there is at most one value in tuple equals to one.
Hence, the original answer indices vector X is decompsed into many different rep-
resetation according to different value of ?1 and ?2. If l is even, the number of all
possible decompositions is picking l/2 elements from l elements, i.e.
(
l
l/2
)
. Whereas,
for an odd l, this number would be 2
(
l
(l?1)/2
)
.
But since ?2 is determined by s ? ?1 and the possible value of ?1 is in the range
of [0, l ? 2n/D] where D is the prescribed density, the probability of a correct guess
of ?1 is then
( ll/2)
l?2n/D assuming l is even. If we consider the hardest knapsack problem
whose hamming weight is n/2 and D is 1, using equation (3), we obtain the proba-
bility of correct guess in this case is O÷(2?n/2). Clearly, this probability is too small.
Therefore, if we choose a modulus M , reducing the range of options and increasing
redundancy, equation (6) transfers into
?1 = AY =
n·
i=1
yiai ? R(mod M) and ?2 = AZ =
n·
i=1
ziai ? s?R( mod M)
As a result, to find a decomposition of ?1 and ?2, two full sets of modular knapsack
with target sum R and s ? R are constructed. If picking M near the number of
decompositions in original problem, i.e.
(
l
l/2
)
, the expected number of solutions to
each of these two modular subknapsacks is
L =
(
n
l/2
)
M
=
(
n
l/2
)(
l
l/2
)
22
If we still substitute n/2 into l and estimate binomial using equation (3), the list size
of solution of modular sub-knapsack would be O÷(2h(1/4)n/2n/2) = O÷(20.3113n).
HGJ algorithm believes that to solve these two sub-knapsack problem will spend
time O÷(L). Two lists are obtained from these two sub-knapsack problem and we de-
note them as List1bl/2c and List
2
bl/2c. To merge partial sums in List
1
bl/2c and List
2
bl/2c,
we search collision between ?1 and ?2 and check their legality of overlapping in two
lists. By using sort and match technique, it will done in time O÷(L) = O÷(20.3113n).
(Although May and Meurer [27] proved that there are some mistakes in the analysis
of HGJ algorithm in paper [17]. Its actual running time should be O÷(2(0.337n). For
more detail, see [7])
To conclude, the basic idea under HGJ algorithm is to divide original problem
into 2 or more modular sub-knapsack problems with target sum R(mod M) and
s?R( mod M). By correct guessing of R and s?R, using matching method to paste
partial solution and get the solution of original problem.
3.4 Simple version of HGJ algorithm
Howgrave Graham and Joux introduced two versions of HGJ algorithm (simple ver-
sion and recursive version) in [17]. In this paper, we will only focus on its simple
version.
We start introducing simple version with assumptions. To facilitate the analysis,
we assume that the size of knapsack n is a multiple of 4. Whether n is a multiple of
4 will not effect the result of analysis. The time and space complexity will still hold
when n is not a multiple of 4. Another assumption is that the hamming weight of
solution satisfies l =
·n
i=1 xi = bn/2c. Should this not be the case, algorithm can
be run bn/2c times with different target sum from 0 to bn/2c. Since bn/2c is within
polynomial time, it will not effect the time complexity. In the process of bn/2c times
running, l = bn/2c is the hardest case and dominates the total running time.
The process of simple version is shown below

indices: a list of answer indices vector
Different from original idea in section 3.3, instead of solving knapsack problem by
24
dividing into 2 sub-knapsack problem, simple version will decompose original answer
indices vector into 4 parts such that:
s = ?1 + ?2 + ?3 + ?4
where ?i is a guess of decomposion by picking bl/4c elements from original answer
subset. Then each indices vector with target sum ?i can be obtained sub-knapsack
with hamming weight l? = bl/4c, i.e.???????
?1 = AT =
·n
i=1 tiai
?2 = AU =
·n
i=1 uiai
?3 = AV =
·n
i=1 viai
?4 = AW =
·n
i=1wiai
under the constraint???????
·n
i=1 ti = l/4, ti ? {0, 1} for all i·n
i=1 ui = l/4, ui ? {0, 1} for all i·n
i=1 vi = l/4, vi ? {0, 1} for all i·n
i=1 wi = l/4, wi ? {0, 1} for all i
Similar with the original idea, answer indices vector X = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) can be ob-
tained by X = T + U + V +W , when there is no overlapping in vector T , U , V and
W . We represent xi in the form (ti, ui, vi, wi). Then since xi = ti + ui + vi + wi and
xi ? {0, 1}, no overlapping means there is at most a 1 in quadruple (ti, ui, vi, wi),
where ti, ui, vi, wi ? {0, 1}.
Letting ? denotes the number of all possible decompositions of answer subset, then
when l is a multiple of 4, we can get
? =
(
l
l/4
)
?
(
3l/4
l/4
)
?
(
l/2
l/4
)
when l = 0 mod 4
However, no matter whether l is a mutiple of four, according to StirlingÕs formula, ?
would be the size of O÷(2(n)).
Then by picking a prime M near 2?n where ? is in the range of (1/4, 1/3), ?1, ?2, ?3
and ?4 can be represented in ZM , i.e.???????
?1 = R1( mod M)
?2 = R2( mod M)
?3 = R3( mod M)
?4 = s?R1 ?R2 ?R3( mod M)
(7)
Since R4 is determined by other 3 values, the expected number of solutions out of 4
sub-knapsack problem that satisfies equation (7) would be ?
M3
.
25
Then the overall running time of the algorithm is O÷(max(20.3113n, 20.0872n+?n) and
the memory requirement would be O÷(20.5436n??n). If a more detailed process and
analysis is needed, see setion 7.1 for unbalanced case and analogy balanced case from
unbalanced case.
26
4 Rearrange knapsack vector and good arrange-
ment
In last section, we have talked about random knapsack problem in balanced case. In
the following sections, we will focus on unbalanced case, particularly when a good
arrangement is provided.
Recall unbalanced knapsack problem in section 1.6.3. If l = b?c is unknown, we
can keep trying every possible values from 0 to bn/2c. Since it is in the polynomial
time, it will not effect the complexity of time. So we can always assume that l is
known.
Basic meet-in-the-middle algorithm constructs two list List(1) and List(2) contain-
ing all possible sums in knapsack vector from first half and second half. Then search
collision ?1 = s ? ?2 in these two lists. If collision happen, add indices vector to
solution list. If we know l/2 elements in the answer subset come from first half of
knapsack vector, and l/2 from the second half, then basic meet-in-the-middle algo-
rithm can be applied easily to unbalanced case. When computing List(1) and List(2),
we just ignore the sums whose hamming weight of indices vector is not l/2. This
change is important, since the time complexity of basic meet-in-the-middle algorithm
as well as Schroeppel-Samir algorithm is O÷(L), where L is the size of the list. So
reducing the size of list will directly reduce the running time. Even though the run-
ning time of HGJ algorithm is not O÷(L), the size of list also effects its running time
dramatically, since in HGJ algorithm, Schroeppel-Samir algorithm or other methods
would be called to solve its sub-knapsack problem. List(1) and List(2) contains all
possible sum whose indices vectorÕs hamming weight is l/2 in each half respectively
and there are n/2 elements in each half, so the size of list would be the number that
picking l/2 elements from a n set, which is
(
n/2
l/2
)
.
Thanks to existence of complementary knapsack, we can always assume that l ² n/2.
If l 6= n/2, from the view of theoretical analysis, the running time of basic meet-
in-the-middle algorithm and Schroeppel-Samir algorithm are not O÷(2n/2) anymore.
Since when l 6= n/2, (n/2
l/2
)
and 2n/2 are not whithin polynomial factors of each other.
Even if l = n/2, in practice,
(
n/2
l/2
)
is still smaller than 2n/2, which will also be helpful
to reduce the running time.
Thanks to Coppersmith algorithm which can be found in paper [23], the assump-
tion that half of answer subset come from the first half in knapsack vector and the
remaining half come from the second half is reasonable. The basic idea of Copper-
smith algorithm is to rearrange the knapsack vector to meet the assumption described
above. More specifically, to apply Coppersmith algorithm to basic birthday algorithm,
it will distinguish two case whether n is even or not. When n is even, Coppersmith
algorithm can be appled directly, it will construct knapsacks with original target sum
by rearrange the elements in knapsack vector in different order. One method to rear-
27
range elements is to rotate knapsack vector in the step of 1, i.e. the i-th element in
next knapsack is the (i-1)-th element in last knapsack (a?i = a(i?1) mod n). Considering
that, if knapsack vector in original problem is A = (a1, a2, . . . , an), then once applying
Coppersmith algorithm will generate a knapsack (a2, a3, . . . , an, a1). Twice applying
will generate a knapsack (a3, a4, . . . an, a1, a2). After n times applying, n knapsack
will be generated. Among these n knapsack, there is at least a knapsack whose half
of elements in answer subset come from the first half of knapsack vector. To prove
this is useful, considering a sliding window with n/2 elements intersects fixed l/2
elements at least once, for more information see [23]. In worst case, it will take n
times iterations of Coppersmith algorithm.
When n is odd, we solve original knapsack problem by solving two knapsack prob-
lems. If the knapsack vector is (a1, a2, . . . , an), hamming weight is l and target sum
is s in original knapsack problem, then when n is odd, solving original problem is
equivalent to solving two knapsacks with n ? 1 elements (a1, a2, . . . , an?1) and two
target sum s and (s?an). In other words, it can distinguish two cases. If an is not in
the answer subset, solving n?1 elements in which l elements is picked knapsack with
target sum s can obtain solution. On the other hand, if an is in the answer subset,
solving n ? 1 elements in which l ? 1 elements is picked knapsack with target sum
s ? an can obtain solution. Then in these two knapsack problems, since n ? 1 is an
even number, problem return to even case.
As an alternative, we can randomize the order of elements in knapsack vector A.
Then test whether new knapsack satisfies our assumption. Dividing n elements into
2 halves, the number of all possible probabilities are
(
n
l
)
. Picking l/2 elements from
l elements in answer subset, we obtain
(
l
l/2
)
. Then by picking rest n/2 ? l/2 ele-
ments in first half from non-answer subset, we obtain
(
n?l
n/2?l/2
)
. Then we find the
probability of our assumption is
( ll/2)?( n?ln/2?l/2)
(nl)
. Thus the expected number of trials is
(nl)
( ll/2)?( n?ln/2?l/2)
= O(
Ã
n), if using StirlingÕs fomular.
When applying Schroeppel-Samir algorithm to unbalanced case, similarly, we will
hope that the elements in answer subset is distributed evenly in four quaters, i.e.
the hamming weight of answer indices vector in each quater is bl/4c. We call the
knapsacks satisfy the assumption described above good arrangement.
Similar with basic birthday algorithm, if good arrangement is provided, Schroeppel-
Samir algorithm and HGJ algorithm can be modified into unbalanced case easily.
When constructing 4 lists,
(
n/4
l/4
)
possible sums would be added to each list, rather
than 2n/4. Let us assume that n mod 4 = 0. Good arrangement can be achieved by
first applying the whole knapsack Coppersmith algorithm and then in each half of
knapsack, applying Coppersmith algorithm again. Since the only way we can exam-
ine whether the knapsack is in good arrangement is trying to find the solution. So in
deterministic way, we will try at most n3/4 times. Similarly, if arrange elements in
28
knapsack vector in random order, the expected number of trials is O(n3/2).
From this section onwards, we will discuss the unbalanced knapsack problem, when
good arrangement is provided.

5 Priority queue version of Schroeppel-Samir al-
gorithm
When discussing Schroeppel-Samir algorithm, we will pay more attetion to 4 way
merge algorithm. The reason is, on one hand, it dominates the running time of
Schroeppel-Samir algorithm in most case. On the other hand, it will also be called in
HGJ algorithm and it also effects the running time in HGJ algorithm dramatically.
Since priority queue 4-way merge algorithm exists for a long time, in this section,
we will only analyze its time and space complexity briefly. Then we will talk about
a small error in original algorithm and present a modified version. Finally, we will
discuss experiment and its result.
5.1 Theoretical analysis
5.1.1 Time and memory complexity
In order to facilitate analysis, in the following sections, we always assume that n and l
are divisible by 4. Recalling Schroeppel-Samir algorithm and its priority queue 4-way
merge, first, knapsack vector is divided into 4 quarters. In each quarter, compute all
possible sums and add them into a list. Then we obtain 4 lists, whose size would
be
(dn/4e
l/4
)
=
( dn/4e
(?n)/4
)
, if good arrangement is provided. Using binomial asymptotic
approximation, the size of lists would be 2h(?)n/4. To merge 4 lists using priority
queue, it will take square of the list size time to find all solution, i.e.
(dn/4e
l/4
)2
=
O÷(2h(?)n/2). Then the total running time is O÷(2h(?)n/4) + O÷(2h(?)n/2) = O÷(2h(?)n/2).
To store priority queue and lists containing possible sums in each quarter, it requires(dn/4e
l/4
)
= O÷(2h(?)n/4) bis memory.
5.1.2 Early abort strategy
However, often, we do not care all the solutions. When only a single solution is
concerned, we can quit the algorithm after first solution is found, which we call it
early abort strategy. We denote the number of solution as ?. If all indices vectors
have equal probability to be the answer indices vector, heuristically, we expect 4-way
merge algorithm will find a solution at time O÷(2h(?)n/2)/?. Although, when we solve
?-unbalanced knapsack problem generated by algorithm 2 with density close to 1,
there is often only one solution. Then algorithm will be expected to stop at half of
the running time, i.e. O÷(2h(?)n/2)/2, i.e. it does not change the time complexity. But
when applying Schroeppel-Samir algorithm to solve sub-knapsack problem in HGJ
algorithm, ? may be large. It may effect the time complexity greatly.
30
In a word, the overall running time would be the time to compute all possible sum
in each quarter add the time to merge 4 lists, i.e.
O÷(2h(?)n/4) + O÷(2h(?)n/2/?) = O÷(max(2h(?)n/4), 2h(?)n/2/?))
5.1.3 Parallel
Priority queue 4-way merge algorithm can not be modified parallelly. This algorithm
needs to construct two list List(1) and List(2) implicitly, and then searches for collision
in two lists. The basic idea of priority queue 4-way merge algorithm is to maintain
partial of List(1) and List(2) by priority queue, so as to reduce the memory require-
ment. Since the next state of queues depend on their last state, algorithm can not
be divided into several subtasks. Thereby, algorithm can only be executed serially.
5.2 Modified version
There is a small error in priority queue 4-way merge algorithm described in [17].
Original algorithm searches collisions by poping and comparing the lowest value in
two priority queues. However, since in priority queue elements can be obtained from
the end of queue, when collision happen with several consecutive q1 and q2, algorithm
will lose part of combination of q1 and q2. To make this clear, considering this case,
if the state of two priority queues are
Queue 1:
(
Priority:
Tuple:
q
(i, j)
)
,
(
Priority:
Tuple:
q
(i?, j?)
)
,
(
Priority:
Tuple:
q?
(i??, j??)
)
, . . .
Queue 2:
(
Priority:
Tuple:
q
(k, l)
)
,
(
Priority:
Tuple:
q
(k?, l?)
)
,
(
Priority:
Tuple:
q??
(k??, l??)
)
, . . .
here, collision should happen 4 times ([(i, j) and (k, l)], [(i, j) and (k?, l?)], [(i?, j?) and (k, l)],
[(i?, j?) and (k?, j?)]). But in original algorithm priority queue can only compare the
value at the end of queue, i.e. [(i, j) and (k, l)], [(i?, j?) and (k?, l?)]. Although, when
applying Schroeppel-Samir algorithm to solve the problem directly, ? is small. Hence,
collision rarely happen, and moreover consecutive collision with the same priority in
queues happen much more rarely. In most case, such an error will not effect the result.
However, when applying Schroeppel-Samir algorithm in HGJ algorithm to solve the
sub-knapsack problem, ? would be much larger. Such an error will lose some solution
of the sub-knapsack problem.
To fix this error, every time collision at value q happens, algorithm should test whether
the next elementÕs priority in queue is q. If it does, add this element into a list. By
combining all elements in list, algorithm finds all solutions.

5.3 Experiment
When implementing experiment, as n increases, for a given density, the size of num-
ber can be larger than the bound of int type in C. So we need a large number library.
NTL is a high-performance, portable C++ library providing data structures and al-
gorithms for manipulating signed, arbitrary length integers, and for vectors, matrices,
and polynomials over the integers and over finite fields. It can combine with GMP
(the GNU Multi-Precision library) for a powerful performance on Unix. WinNTL is
a windows version library and can be used in versions after windows 95.
All experiments in this paper is implemented by NTL library. One reason to use
NTL is its speed. NTLÕs polynomial arithmetic is the fastest available anywhere.
Its speed for polynomial factorization even holds the world record. Another reason
is NTL is a open source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License, which we can use it free.
Experiments run in a dual-core Intel core i3 cpu at 2.13*2 Ghz with memory 2 GB.
Table 1 shows as n increases, the running time of Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm grows
exponentially. When early abort strategy is applied, experment result conforms our
33
analysis. The first row indicates the size of knapsack n.

6 Modular version
6.1 Theoretical analysis
6.1.1 Time complexity
Recall the modular 4-way merge algorith in section 3.2. As input, to construct 4 lists
List
(1)
L , List
(1)
R , List
(2)
L and List
(2)
R in Schroeppel and Shamir algorithm is inevitable
process. When good arrangement is provided, the number of all possible sums in each
quarter is
(
n/4
l/4
)
. Namely, there would be
(
n/4
l/4
)
values adding into each list. Using
StirlingÕs fomular,
(
n/4
l/4
)
= 2h(?)n/4, where ? = l/n. Thereby, the time complexity of
modular version used by Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm is at least O÷(2h(?)n/4).
There are 4 loops in the mainbody of algorithm. Obiviously, outermost loop will be ex-
ecutedM times. The number of times of the second loop is the size of max(List
(1)
L , List
(2)
L ,
i.e.
(
n/4
l/4
)
= 2h(?)n/4. The third loop is trying to match a sum in List
(1)
L to a modular
sum in List
(1)
R (M). To estimate the number that matching happen for each element
in List
(1)
L and for each ?M , it is equivalent to address such a probability problem.
Imagine that we have a balls and b boxes. We want to put these a balls into b
boxes. Our goal is caculating the expected number of balls in each box, assuming
that each ball has equal probability to put into each box and every ball should be
located into a box. Then for each box the probability to get a ball is 1/b. We have a
balls, so the expected number of balls is a/b. In this simple problem, we can also be-
lieve that the expected number of balls equals the number that assign a balls equally
into b boxes, i.e. a/b.
If we take sums in List
(1)
R (M) as a balls, modulus M as b boxes, then by substi-
tuting size of List
(1)
R (M) =
(
n/4
l/4
)
= (2h(?)n/4) into a and M into b respectively, we can
get for each elements and for each ?M in List
(1)
L , the expected number of elements in
List
(1)
R (M) satisfying ?M = ?
(1)
L + ?
(1)
R mod M is
2h(?)n/4
M
.
Therefore, the total time complexity is the product of iterations of 4 loops, i.e.
M?2h(?)n/4? 2h(?)n/4
M
?? = O÷(2h(?)n/2)??. In most case, the number of solution ? is small
and can be considered as constant, so the expected running time is O÷(2h(?)n/2). But
when applying modular 4-way merge to solve the subknapsack in HGJ algorithm, ?
can be large. In this case, the time complexity can be written as max(O÷(2h(?)n/2), ?).
Since O÷(2h(?)n/2) and O÷(2h(?)n/4) are not within the polynomial factor with each other,
the time to construct 4 input lists are ignored.
From final result, we can see M has nothing to do with time complexity. But in
fact, M does effect the running time and the best M should equal to the size of 4 in-
put lists, i.e.
(
n/4
l/4
)
. As decribed above, a smaller M increases the size of List(1)(?M),
which will cause more time in sorting and searching. Consider extreme case, when
35
M = 1, thus Schroeppel and Shamir algorithm degrade into basic meet-in-the-middle
algorithm. However, a larger M also causes growth in running time. Since equation
of our running time is M ? 2h(?)n/4 ? 2h(?)n/4
M
? ? and, in each loop, code would be exe-
cuteed at least once, i.e. 2
h(?)n/4
M
³ 1. So when M ³ 2h(?)n/4, running time becomes
M ? 2h(?)n/4 ? 1 ? ?. Thus, when M ³ 2h(?)n/4, as M increases, the running time
increases. For an experimental result that different M effects the running time, see
section 6.2.
6.1.2 Memory complexity
There are 8 lists to be stored in algorithm. Lists List
(1)
L , List
(1)
R , List
(2)
L and List
(2)
R
store all the possible sum in each quarter. Thus their size should be
(
n/4
l/4
)
= 2h(?)n/4,
if good arrangement is provided. List
(1)
R (M) and List
(2)
R (M) store modular of the
elements in List
(1)
R and List
(2)
R respectively, so their size are 2
h(?)n/4 as well. As
a variant version of meet-in-the-middle algorithm, instead of constructing the full
list of List(1) and List(2) to search for collisions in these two lists, modular version of
Schroeppel and Shamir algorithm constructs List(1)(?M) dividing List
(1) into disjoint
union of smaller sets. By searching collisions in two smaller sets, modular version of
Schroeppel and Shamir algorithm saves the memory requirement. Then to estimate
the size of List(1)(?M), our problem becomes caculating the expected number for
each value of M when from a (
(
n/4
l/4
)
)2 set List(1) mapping to a M space. Using the
equation we come up from balls and boxes, we obtain the expected size of List(1)(?M)
is
((n/4l/4))
2
M
= 2h(?)n/2.
But we can not always guarantee that the size of List
(1)
R (M) is
2h(?)n/2
M
. Consider-
ing this case, we choose a M where every elements ai in knapsack vector is divisible
by M . In this case, all sums in List(1) is distributed in List(1)(?M = 0), i.e. the
biggest size of is List(1)(?M) = List
(1)(?M = 0) = List
(1) = 2h(?)n/2. However, ac-
cording to Corollary 1 in paper [17], this probability is exponentially small.
Adding these 8 lists together, the memory complexity is max(
(
n/4
l/4
)
,
((n/4l/4))
2
M
, ?). Hence,
it suggests that the memory complexity is
(
n/4
l/4
)
at least. To minimize the memory
complexity, we want
(n/4l/4)
2
M
² (n/4
l/4
)
. If we pick M =
(
n/4
l/4
)
, then the memory complex-
ity becomes max(
(
n/4
l/4
)
, ?) = max(2h(?)n/4, ?).
36
6.1.3 Parallel
Modular version of Schroeppel-Samir algorithm can be modified into a parallel algo-
rithm. When creating lists List(1)(?), List(2)(?), List(3)(?) and List(4)(?), it can be
divided into 4 sub-task, i.e. computing all possible sums in each quarter. In each
sub-tasks, the algorithm can parallel computing each sum. When the algorithm fin-
ishes this part, synchronization is needed to ensure that 4 lists has been computed
completely. In modular 4-way merge, each trial of ?M can be computed parallelly.
In each trial of ?M , each trial of List
(1)
L [i] can be completed parallelly. After that, a
synchronization is needed to ensure each List(1)(?M) completes their computing.
Note that in Schroeppel-Samir algorithm, when computing the lists, all lists are mu-
tual exclusion fields. In modular 4-way merge, every List(1)[?M ] are mutual exclusion
fields as well. Lock or other methods should be applied to ensure consistency. In the
pseudo-code, we ignore the method to ensure consistency.
A formal version of parallel Schroeppel-Samir algorithm with modular 4-way merge
is shown as follow:
Algorithm 8: Parallel Schroeppel-Samir algorithm

end for
end for
end for
end for
output:
Solution: a list of solutions
For time complexity, 2h(?)n/2 still holds in parallel version. However, memory re-
quirement will increase to 2h(?)n/2. Because this parallel algorithm will construct all
List(1)(?M) as an array at the same time, which is equivalent to construct full list of
List(1) =
(
n/4
l/4
)2
= 2h(?)n/2.
6.1.4 Other issues
High bit version
In addition to dividing List(1) by modulus M , a high bit 4-way merge can also works.
Recall equation of 4-way merge
?(1) = ?
(1)
L + ?
(1)
R = s? ?(2)L ? ?(2)R
The main idea is that, this algorithm will try to guess the higher n/4 bits of ?(1).
For each trial of high bit of ?(1), high bit version searches in List
(1)
L and List
(1)
R
satisfying the higher n/4 bits of ?
(1)
L + ?
(1)
R equal to high bit of ?
(1). Similarly, in
List
(2)
L and List
(2)
R , the algorithm search for these high bits too. Finally, by testing
s = ?
(1)
L + ?
(1)
R + ?
(2)
L + ?
(2)
R , the algorithm output the solutions. The time and mem-
ory complexity would be the same as modular version, which is 2h(?)n/2 and 2h(?)n/4
respectively.
Early abort strategy
Early abort strategy can also applied to modular version of Schroeppel-Samir al-
gorithm, if we only concern a single solution. As we analyze in section 5.1.2, the
heuristic expected running time is O÷(max(2h(?)n/4, 2h(?)n/4/?)).
39
6.2 Experiment results
To examine the correctness of analysis, two experiments are implemented.

7 simple HGJ algorithm in good arrangement
7.1 Theoretical analysis
7.1.1 Time complexity
First, let us recall the main idea of simple HGJ algorithm. Instead of solving original
knapsack problem directly, simple HGJ algorithm divide original problem into 4 sub-
knapsack problem with original knapsack vector and target sum ?1, ?2, ?3, ?4. Where
? suffices
s = ?1 + ?2 + ?3 + ?4
To help understanding this equation, suppose that we have already known the answer
subset of problem. Then if we further decompose the answer subset into 4 sets, the
sum of every elements in each set always satisfies s = ?1+?2+?3+?4. In other words,
every correct guess of (?1, ?2, ?3, ?4) stands for a decomposion of answer subset. Let
? denotes all decomposition divided into 4 sets, then if good arrangement is provided
? =
(
l/4
l/16
)4
?
(
3l/16
l/16
)4
?
(
l/8
l/16
)4
Using StirlingÕs fomular, and substitute ? = l/n
? = 22?n
To increase the correct rate of guessing, a modulus M is used. Namely, algorithm
tries to search for a decomposition for the answer subset such that ?1 = R1 (mod M),
?2 = R2 (mod M), ?3 = R3 (mod M) and ?4 = R4 = s?R1 ?R2 ?R3 (mod M).
Now, to estimate the number of decomposion found for a given M , letÕs come to
our geme of balls and boxes. Obiviously, the number of balls is the number of decom-
posisions ?. When the value of R1, R2, R3 is determined, R4 is fixed. And because
the number of possible values for R1, R2 and R3 are M . For all possible combination
of R1, R2 and R3, there are M
3 possilbe values, i.e. there are M3 boxes. Now, we
want to allocate ? balls into M3 boxes, the expected number of balls in each box is
?/M3. Namely, we expect there are ?/M3 decomposions of answer subset, for every
trial R1, R2, R3..
To make this heuristic expectation formally, Corollary 2 and Corollary 5 in paper [17]
are needed. When applying Corollary 5 to our unbalanced case when good arrange-
ment is given, the only difference with Corollary 5 is that the establishment of con-
ditions log2(M) > (3log2(3)/16)n should be changed into ?
1/3 > M > ?(3log2(3)/16) Å
?0.2972. In other words, when M > ?(3log2(3)/16) we believe there will be ?/M3 decom-
posions found for every trial R1, R2, R3. Following the idea of [17], we extend the
condition and belive that when ?1/3 > M > ?0.25, our expected number will still hold.
To generate 4 lists containing decompositions of solution, 4 modular knapsack prob-
lems are constructed, whose modulus is M and target sums equal to R1, R2, R3 and
41
R4 respectively. When we get these 4 lists, then knapsack problem becomes a search-
ing and matching problem which can be solved by 4 way merge algorithm.
When solving the modular sub-knapsack problems, we recall section 1.6.1 that mod-
ular knapsack problems and integer knapsack problems are equivalent in exponential
time algorithm. Notice that there is a little difference in the strategy as we described
in section 1.6.1, when applying to unbalanced case. Since there are l elements will add
to our modular target sum, the range of target sum in integer is [0, lM ? 1]. Hence,
if s is a value less than M , then modular unbalanced knapsack problem becomes l
integer knapsack problem with target sum s, s+M , . . ., S + (l ? 1)M .
Then by calling integer knapsack problem algorithm, we can obtain 4 lists contain-
ing decomposions of solution. As original problem is divided into 4 sub-knapsack
problems, the hamming weight of 4 sub-knapsack should be l/4. In convenience of
analysis, here, we use modular version of Schroeppel-Samir algorithm to solve sub-
knapsack problem. Recall our time analysis in section 6.1.1. In the sub-knapsack
problem, knapsack vector is divided into 4 quarters. Then in each quarter, the possi-
ble sum would be added by l/16 elements. Hence, the size of List
(1)
L , List
(1)
R , List
(2)
L
and List
(2)
R would be
(
n/4
l/16
)
, if good arrangement is provided. As the time complexity
of Schroeppel-Samir algorithm is square of the size of inputed lists, then it would be
(
(
n/4
l/16
)
)2.
However, depending on the choice of M , the number of solutions may be large, which
may dominate the running time. There are
(
n/4
l/16
)4
possible sums in each sub-knapsack
problem. We map these
(
n/4
l/16
)4
values into a size M space. Then there will be
(n/4l/16)
4
M
sums for value in M . In other words, we expect the number of solutions of sub-
knapsack problem is
(n/4l/16)
4
M
.
In a word, the time complexity to slove the sub-knapsack problem is O÷(max(
(
n/4
l/16
)2
,
(n/4l/16)
4
M
)).
If using StirlingÕs formular, it will be
O÷(max(
(
n/4
l/16
)2
,
(
n/4
l/16
)4
M
)) = O÷(max(2h(0.25?)n/2, 2h(0.25?)n/M))
In next step, we use 4-way merge algorithm to search collisions in the solution of 4
sub-knapsacks. Recall overlapping in section 3.4, if a indices vector overlaps, it can
not be a valid solution. To check the overlapping, modular 4-way merge should be
modified.

Solution: a list of solutions
In order to distinguish the modulus when used in 4-way merge and solving sub-
knapsack problem, we denote the modulus in modular 4-way merge as M ?. Actu-
ally, there are only several difference between original modular 4-way merge and the
overlap checking version. First, to check overlapping, 4-way merge needs to know
indices vector corresponding to the sums. Second, when every time two lists merge,
check whether elements in list overlap. Rather than check overlapping when insert-
ing solution once only, checking overlaps when inserting List(1)(?M ?), implict list
List(2)(?M ?) and solution three times per literation is prefered. Since prevent insert-
ing the list in early stage, will be helpful to reduce expansion in list size. Third, early
abort strategy should be applied. Depending on the choice of M in last stage, the
number of decompositions containing in the List
(1)
L , List
(1)
R , List
(2)
L and List
(2)
R may
be in exponential size which will effect the running time. Note that, the bound of our
analysis will hold as long as early abort strategy is applied.
In original paper [17], it suggests algorithm to pick a random ?M ? , instead of try
every ?M ? in order. But we do not think that is a better choice. Though, the ex-
pected running time are the same, to pick ?M ? in order will let algorithm be bound to
stop after M ? times iterations. If, in last stage, algorithm fail to guess correct values
of ?1, ?2, ?3 and ?4, randomized approach will never end.
Let us come back to our complexity analysis. Recall that the size of solutions out-
put from sub-knapsack problem is
(n/4l/16)
4
M
), i.e. the list size input into modular 4-way
merge is
(n/4l/16)
4
M
). For a full round of modular 4-way merge algorithm, the time com-
plexity is the square of input list size, i.e. (
(n/4l/16)
4
M
)2. In order to distinguish the ? used
in sub-knapsack problem, here we use ? ? denotes number of solutions when merging
the solution, i.e. the number of decompositions of solution for a given trial of ?1, ?2,
?3 and ?4. From our previous analysis, this expected number of decompositions is
? ? = ?/M3 =
( l/4l/16)
4?(3l/16l/16 )
4?( l/8l/16)
4
M3
.
If ? ? < 1, this expected number of decompositions means the probability, for a given
M , , which pick 4 random values and these 4 value can be represented as a decom-
posion of solution. In this case, we heuristically believe that running simple HGJ
algorithm once will not guess the values of ?1, ?2, ?3 and ?4 correctly. Actually, we
44
expect by running the algorithm the reciprocal of probability times (i.e. M3/?) will
find a correct combination of ?1, ?2, ?3 and ?4. If ?
? > 1, we expect there are more
than one decompositions of answer subset can be found, when we apply 4-way merge.
Thus, we can use early abort strategy and expect 4-way merge will stop at 1/? of the
time of whole progress.
We summarize that if using early abort strategy or running algorithm repeatedly, a so-
lution will be found at time (
(n/4l/16)

M
)2/? ? = (
(n/4l/16)

=
(n/4l/16)
8?M
( l/4l/16)
4?(3l/16l/16 )
4?( l/8l/16)
4 .
Using StirlingÕs fomular, it will be
O÷(
(
n/4
l/16
)8 ?M(
l/4
l/16
)4 ? (3l/16
l/16
)4 ? ( l/8
l/16
)4 ) = O÷(22h(0.25?)n?2?n ?M)
To composite the time complexity of two stage, we have O÷(max(
(
n/4
l/16
)2
,
(n/4l/16)
4
M
,
(n/4l/16)
8?M
( l/4l/16)
4?(3l/16l/16 )
4?( l/8l/16)
4 )).
Next, we prove that as long as ?1/3 ³M ³ ?0.25 (i.e. in the range of [2(2/3)?n, 20.5?n]),
(n/4l/16)
8?M
( l/4l/16)
4?(3l/16l/16 )
4?( l/8l/16)
4 ³ (

is always true.
To prove:

8?M

4?(3l/16l/16 )
4?( l/8l/16)
4 ³ (

4
M
?? 22h(0.25?)n?2?n ?M ³ 2h(0.25?)n/M
?? M ³ 2?n?h(0.25?)n/2
Because
M ³ 20.5?n
To prove
M ³ 2?n?h(0.25?)n/2
is equivalent to prove
20.5?n ³ 2?n?h(0.25?)n/2
?? 2h(0.25?)n/2?0.5?n ³ 1
?? 2?0.25?log2(0.25?)?(1??/4)log2(1??/4)??n ³ 1
?? ? ² 0.6257
Thanks to complementary knapsack, we can imply that ? ² 0.6257 is always true.
Thus,
(n/4l/16)
8?M
( l/4l/16)
4?(3l/16l/16 )
4?( l/8l/16)
4 ³ (

is always true.
Similarly, we can imply that
(
n/4

)2 ² (n/4l/16)8?M
( l/4l/16)
4?(3l/16l/16 )
4?( l/8l/16)
4 is always true. Thus, our
time complexity of simple HGJ algorithm becomes
O÷(max(
(

(
n/4

l/4
l/16

l/16
)4 ? ( l/8

(8)
45
Depending on the choice of M where 2(2/3)?n ² M ² 20.5?n, our time complexity is
in the range of
[O÷(2h(0.25?)n?1.5?n), O÷(2h(0.25?)n?(4/3)?n)]
Next, we prove that the time complexity of simple HGJ algorithm is always better
than that of Schroeppel-Samir algorithm, i.e. to prove
O÷(2h(0.25?)n?(4/3)?n) < O÷(2h(?)n/2)
?? (0.25?)log2(0.25?) + (1? 0.25?)(log2(1? 0.25?)
+(4/3)?? ?log2?? (1? ?)log2(1? ?)) > 0
Computing derivation we find that this is a monotonically increasing function when
0 < ? ² n/2. So when we let ? close to 0, it will get the minimal value which is still
larger than 0. As a consequence, we conclude that simple HGJ algorithm is always
faster than Schroeppel-Samir algorithm.
7.1.2 Memory complexity
When memory is concerned, according to the analysis in section 3.2, it will occupy
O÷(max(
(
n/4
l/16
)
, ?)) memory, when solving sub-knapsacks. The memory complexity to
merge the solutions of these sub-knapsack problem is the same size as input lists,
i.e. ?. Hence the total memory requirement is O÷(max(
(
n/4
l/16
)
, ?)). Using StirlingÕs
fomular,
(
n/4
l/16
)
equals to 2h(?/4)n/4 and the number of solutions ? =
(n/4l/16)
4
M
= 2
h(?/4)n
M
.
We prove that ? = 2
h(?/4)n
M
is always larger than 2h(?/4)n/4.
To prove:
2h(?/4)n
M
> 2h(?/4)n/4
is equivalent to prove
M < 2(3/4)h(?/4) is always true
Because M is in the range of [?0.25,?1/3] = [20.5?n, 2?n?(2/3)]. Hence, to prove original
inequality is equivalent to prove
2?n?(2/3) < 2(3/4)h(?/4) always true
?? h(?/4)? (8/9)? > 0
By computation, we know when ? closes to 0, h(?/4) ? (8/9)? will close to its
minimal value which is larger than 0. Hence, that the time complexity when solving
sub-knapsack problem is
O÷(max(
(
n/4
l/16
)
, ?)) = O÷(?) = O÷(
(
n/4
l/16
)4
M
) (9)
46
Depending on the choice of M where 2(2/3)?n ² M ² 20.5?n, its memory complexity
is in the range of
[O÷(2h(0.25?)n?0.5?n), O÷(2h(0.25?)n?(2/3)?n)]
From equation (8) and equation (9), we can see there is a trade-off between time and
memory complexity. For a experiment result, see section 7.2.
7.1.3 Parallel
Simple HGJ algorithm can be modified into parallel version. When computing all pos-
sible sums for sub-knapsacks, it is similar with parallel Schroeppel-Samir algorithm.
Differece is that modular sums should be inserted into another 4 lists. When sloving
sub-knapsack problems, according to section 1.6.1, every modular knapsack problem
can be divided into l/4 integer knapsack problems. We have 4 modular sub-knapsack
problems. Then we solve problem by first compute 4 modular knapsack problem par-
allelly. In each modular knapsack problem, we solve l/4 integer knapsack problems
parallelly. Note that, List(i)(?), List(i)(?)(M), List(i)(x), List(o)(x)? and List(o)(?)?
are mutual exclusion fields and moreover the sequence of List(i)(?), List(i)(?)(M) and
List(i)(x) should be the same. Similarly, the sequence of List(o)(x)? and List(o)(?)?
should be guaranteed as well. So synchronous and lock technique should be used,
while inserting these lists.
When algorithm completes computing sub-knapsacks, a barrier should be applied
to stop all processes and ensure the integrity of List(o)(x)? and List(o)(?)?. When
merging the solutions of sub-knapsacks, we use parallel modular 4-way merge with
overlap checking and early abort strategy. Although, in this paper, we do not include
this algorithm. But by combining the idea of Algorithm 10 and Algorithm 8, it can
be come up easily.

7.2 Experiment
7.2.1 Simulation of decomposition distribution
To examine our analysis, we start experiment by simulating the distribution of de-
compositions of solution. Namely, for given values of R1, R2, R3 and R4 = s? R1 ?
R2 ? R3 mod M , if dividing answer subset into 4 sets, we caculate the number of
such decompositions where the sum of first set equals to R1, the sum of second set
equals to R2, the sum of third set equals to R3 and the sum of forth set equals to R4.
Compared with simulating and caculating the size of lists by using HGJ algorithm,
using algorithm 12 would be much faster and thus can be used to run many times to
see statistical probability.
Simulating algorithm is outline as follow:

Recall in Algorithm 10: modular 4-way merge with overlap checking. We remove
overlapping elements everytime elements are inserted to List(1)(?M ?), List
(2)(?M ?)
(constructed implictly) and solution, rather than remove overlapping elements once
only when inserting to solution. Algorithm 12 examine the effect of 3 times remov-
ing. The size of solution when removing overlapping only once, is computed by the
product of the size of List

From Table 6, we can see three time removing help to reduce the size of lists greatly

7.2.2 Implementing simple HGJ algorithm
To exam our analysis of simple HGJ algorithm, we implement experiment.
Table 7 reveals that the size of solutions when solving 4 sub-knapsack problems,
when input by different M . According to our analysis, we expect their size is
(n/4l/16)

.

l = 16 and n = 44.
51
Table 8 shows that time and memory trade-off among different M .
In our analysis, we recall that our time complexity is O÷(
(n/4l/16)
8?M
( l/4l/16)
4?(3l/16l/16 )
4?( l/8l/16)
4 ). In
our experiment, we let n = 44, l = 16, then the time complexity is that O÷(646M).
Memory complexity of simple HGJ algorithm is O÷(
(n/4l/16)
4
M
). Then substituting exper-
imental parameter, it becomes O÷(14641
M
).
The first option is to minimize the time complexity by picking M as small as possilbe
which should be 4
Ã(
l/4
l/16
)4 ? (3l/16
l/16
)4 ? ( l/8
l/16
)4
= 24. To compare with Schroeppel-Samir
algorithm, we let simple HGJ run in the same memory with Schroeppel-Samir algo-
rithm, i.e. M = 44. Third option is picking M =
(
l/4
l/16
)4 ? (3l/16
l/16
)4 ? ( l/8
l/16
)40.2936
= 41,
which can be used to prove the algorithm. The final option is to minimize the mem-
ory requirement by maximize M close to (1/3), when 3
Ã(

l/16
)4 ? ( l/8

8 Critical evaluation
The main work of this paper is to analyze Schroeppel-Samir algorithm and HGJ algo-
rithm in unbalanced case and support the analysis with experiments. Here are some
conclusions:
In priority queue Schroeppel-Samir algorithm:
1. When good arrangement of knapsack vector is provided, the time complexity
is
O÷(
(
n/4
l/4
)2
)
and memory complexity is
O÷(
(
n/4
l/4
)
)
2. When using early abort strategy, the time complexity becomes
O÷(
(
n/4
l/4
)2
/?)
where ? is the number of solutions.
3. When there are a large number of solutions, original priority queue Schroeppel-
Samir algorithm may fail to find out all solutions. We improve it by a modified
algorithm.
In modular Schroeppel-Samir algorithm:
4. The time and memory complexity is also O÷(
(
n/4
l/4
)2
) and O÷(
(
n/4
l/4
)
) respectively.
5. Best choice of modulus used in 4-way merge should be the same size of input
lists, i.e.
O÷(
(
n/4
l/4
)
)
6. A parallel version of modular Schroeppel-Samir algorithm is presented.
In HGJ algorithm:
7. The time complexity is
O÷(
(
n/4
l/16
)8 ?M(
l/4
l/16
)4 ? (3l/16
l/16
)4 ? ( l/8
l/16
)4 )
and memory complexity is
O÷(
(
n/4
l/16
)4
M
)
53
8. The time complexity of HGJ algorithm is always better than Schroeppel-Samir
algorithm.
9. A parallel version of HGJ algorithm is presented.
Although, I believe that I have achieved the goal I set at the beginning of this disser-
tation. There are several defects
1. All the theoretical analysis is obtained on the basis of list size. But sometimes
list size can not stand for complexity completely. For example, in HGJ algorithm, we
believe that sub-knapsack problems can be solved within the time of size of solution.
This assumption may not be satisfied in some situations.
2. Dad coding result in great difference in running time, which leads to modular
version of Schroeppel-Samir algorithm can not compare to priority version.
3. Due to time constraints, all experiment is implemented in a small n, which makes
experimental result not as obvious as thought.

9 Further work
Although, this dissertation fully discusses two version of Schroeppel-Samir algorithm
and simple version of HGJ algorithm in unbalanced case. There are still some tasks
left when solving unbalanced knapsack problem:
1. Recursive version of HGJ algorihm. Because of time constraints, we do not cover
the analysis of recursive version. In recursive version, algorithm recursively divide
original problem into 2 sub-knapsacks. Actually, according to [17], recursive version
is faster than simple version.
2. In 2011, Becker, Coron and Joux [18] improved a generic algorithm and got run-
ning time down to O(20.291n). This algorithm represent coefficients of answer indices
vector from (0,1) in HGJ algorithm to (-1,0,1), which introduces additional degree of
freedom that decrease the running time. It is worthy of study to apply this algorithm
to unbalanced case.
