Abstract 
This project has two main aspects. The first one is using the method of Statistical 
Blockade to analyze of PVT variation in SRAM cells. As the feature size of the device 
circuits decreases, the PVT variation becomes an increasing concern. Furthermore, 
this variability will impact the performance of the integrated circuit. On the other 
hand, as the SRAM cell is a high-replication circuit, and there would be millions of 
memory cells in one chip. Therefore, a rare event of the SRAM cell may cause a 
not-so-rare failure of the whole system. Although the standard Monte Carlo method is 
an accurate method of simulating, it is too slow to sample the rare and critical events 
of such high-replication circuit. Due to this situation, an efficient approach of 
simulating the rare circuit event on SRAM is required in terms of providing high 
speed simulating. It could be achieved by using the method of Statistical Blockade. 
 
The second part of the project is the low leakage design of SRAM cell with dual 
threshold voltage transistors. Recently, the Static Power of the circuit plays an 
important role in the total power consumption. Due to technology scaling, to reduce 
the Static Power is important in the design of VLSI systems. In this project, the 
approach of dual threshold voltage is carried out to reduce the leakage power of the 
SRAM cell. There are two kinds of threshold voltage transistors in the SRAM cell, 
one with the normal value of threshold voltage, the other one with the high threshold 
voltage. Within this project, there are three configurations of transistors has been 
proposed with the measurements of the leakage power respectively. Meanwhile, 
within each simulation, the read delay, write delay, and the Static Noise Margin are 
estimated as well. The results show that the approach of the dual threshold voltage 
does not only reduce the leakage power of the SRAM cell, but also improve the Static 
Noise Margin.  
 
The main contributions and achievements of this project are shown as follows: 
? The algorithm of the Statistical Blockade method is implemented in this 
project, and it is adapted as a novel approach of simulating rare circuit events. 
? The idea of further speeding up the simulation of rare circuit events is also 
produced by minimizing the classification threshold and training samples in 
Statistical Blockade approach. 
? Research is carried out to discover the changes in the minimal classification 
threshold and the minimal training samples with different deviations of 
parameters. 
? The low leakage design of an SRAM cell with dual threshold voltage is 
accomplished in this project.

1. Introduction 
 
PVT variation plays an important role in the performance of integrated circuits. PVT 
refers to process(P) parameters, power supply voltages(V) and operating temperatures(T). 
The variations refer to the deviations from designed parameter values. As the current or 
future feature size of the integrated circuit is being reduced, the parameter variations are 
increasing. Moreover, the circuits like SRAM or flip-flop are high-replication, there may 
be millions of the cells in one chip. Therefore, the rare event of the cell would result in a 
not-so-rare failure probability of the system. It is necessary to find a way to simulate the 
rare circuit events efficiently. As we want to meet the further development of this field, it 
is necessary to analyze the PVT variations in SRAM cells and develop a new way to 
detect the rare events of the circuit. 
 
Standard Monte Carlo is an accurate way to simulate the circuit. However, the drawback 
of the simulation is cost of time, and there are large amount of the simulations required to 
sample the rare events of the circuit like SRAM, which will cost longer time. Compared 
to conventional methodology, the Statistical Blockade approach is able to perform a more 
efficient way to sample and analyze the rare circuit events. 
 
Associated with its high performance and wide bus-width capability, embedded memory 
becomes an essential component in VLSI. Embedded memory is one kind of integrated 
on-chip memory which can support the core on chip to accomplish particular functions 
and communication between cores [1]. It is a particular circuit which is high replicated. 
In this project, the analysis of the PVT variation in memory cell using Statistical 
Blockade method, particularly on SRAM cell. By implementing this method, an efficient 
simulation of the rare circuit events on SRAM cell could be achieved. We will also 
propose a way to further speed up the simulation of rare events based on the idea of 
Statistical Blockade. 
 
For integrated circuits design, the power consumption is one of the most essential issues. 
It can be divided into two categories, which refers to dynamic power and static power. At 
the initial stages of chip design, the dynamic power is the dominant part of the total 
power dissipation. Refer to technique scaling, the Static Power is increasingly important. 
In this project, a low leakage design of the SRAM cell with the dual threshold voltage is 
tested, in order to reduce the static power [2].  
 
The general experiments provided in this project are aimed to analyse the PVT variation 
by using Statistical Blockade technique and manipulate a low leakage design with dual 
threshold voltage.

2. Aims and objectives 
This section will express the main aims and the objectives of this project. Further, the 
structure of this dissertation will be explained. 
 
2.1 Aims and objectives 
The aim of this project is to compare the efficiency between conventional and Statistical 
Blockade approach in order to provide a faster rare circuit event under process variation. 
Based on the Statistical Blockade approach which proposed by Singhee [3], the idea of 
further speed up the simulation of rare circuit event will be carried out. Also, it aims to 
propose a low leakage power design and investigate the effects of Static Noise Margin for 
the SRAM cell. 
 
The objectives of this project are going to address following questions: 
 
? What is the problem with the Standard Monte Carlo technique for simulating the 
rare circuit events? Analysis of PVT variation on SRAM cell using Statistical 
Blockade method, and compare this approach with standard MC. 
? Can we further speed up the simulation of rare circuit events based on the method 
of Statistical Blockade? Analyze the idea of minimizing the classification 
threshold and training samples of the classifier. 
? If we widen the deviation of the Gaussian distribution for each parameter, what 
will happen on the value of minimal classification threshold and training samples. 
? How to reduce the leakage power of the SRAM cell? Propose a low leakage 
design on SRAM cell with the dual threshold voltage. 
 
2.2 The structure of this report 
There are four main sections in this report. Firstly, the background of the field which this 
project is proposed is explained in chapter three. The sources of the PVT variation are 
analyzed, and the consideration of variation tolerance design is proposed. The working 
principle and the operations of the SRAM which is the test circuit of our project are 
expressed in this section. We also explain the idea of Statistical Blockade method. The 
low leakage design is also proposed in this section. Secondly, the methods which are used 
in this project and the works carried out are presented in chapter four. It includes the 
detail description of how the method work, the problems we met and how we solve them. 
Next, the result section presents the results of the project we got and the discussion of 
each objective question. Then a critical evaluation of the work we have done is explained, 
and we will discuss whether the work we have done met the initial objectives. Finally, the 
future work related to the area of this project will be discussed in the last section.

3. Background  
3.1 PVT variation 
PVT variation refers to process, voltage, and temperature variation. Process variation 
results from the limitations of manufacturing in nanoscale technologies, variation in 
voltage due to the various power supplies, and temperature variation is because of the 
manufacturing environment [4]. These variations present a negative impact on the device 
quality.  
 
In some research, the process, voltage, and temperature variation can be investigated and 
controlled by their individual systems independently. For instance, the minimum 
consumption of Vdd can be created for various temperature value and different libraries 
by checking them in lookup table depend on the PVT evaluated and controlled system 
[5]. 
 
As the PVT variations are increasingly concerned, it becomes a crucial issue for circuit 
design. Moreover, the integrated circuit design is scaling down, hence, how to control the 
variation of each parameter is an important part of circuit design. In this situation, 
generating a series of design techniques to minimize the effects of these parameter 
variations on the device performance is necessary. In this project, we will propose the 
particular circuit level model which refers to SRAM to analyze the impact of PVT 
variations on nanometer technologies, that is specifically 32 nm and below. Then 
compare this simulation result of circuit level model with the existing behavioral model. 
 
3.1.1 Sources of variability 
There are two sources of variation which can influence the electrical performance of the 
integrated circuits. One kind of sources are environmental factors, it is caused by the 
specifics of the design implementation. These factors include changes in power supply 
voltage? temperature, and switching activities, and are highly design dependent [6]. The 
other kind of sources are physical factors which arise due to integrated circuit 
manufacturing process and wear-out (electromigration), and usually permanent. These 
factors refer to the variations in characteristics of devices and wires, for example, 
effective channel length, gate oxide thickness, threshold voltage, and so on. Physical 
factors can be further divided into two categories, Die-to-Die physical variations and 
Within-Die physical variations, respectively. The former ones are usually predict by using 
worst-case corners and are independent of the design implementation. The later ones are 
Within-Die physical variations, compared with Die-to-Die variations, they depend on the 
circuit layout and there is no general method yet exist to predict them [6].  
 
4 
 
 
 
From another perspective, the parametric variation components can be divided into four 
categories. The first one is global variation between different chips, and it is given by 
case files during the designing. This may include fab, lot, wafer, and reticle level 
variations. The second kind of variation component are local variations, it comes from 
totally random variation, and mainly influences the performance of differential circuit, 
such as current mirrors and differential amplifier offset voltage. Then the third category is 
position dependent variations, this is resulted from across chip gradients. And it plays an 
important role in global clocks, large analog blocks, and long critical paths. The fourth 
kind of variation is based on proximity and orientation, and it is not random but 
systematic and deterministic. This kind of variations can be improved by process changes, 
and can also be modeled and simulated [7]. 
 
Due to such variability and margins for devices and interconnect are not scaling at the 
same rate, those sources of variability aroused a larger concern. Figure 3.1 illustrate the 
device and interconnect variations trends for different technology generations. As we can 
see from Figure 2.1, the percentage of total variation of some device parameters 
increased gradually from 1997 to 2007. During that period of time, the wire geometry, 
such as width W, height H, thickness T, and resistivity ? represents a significant increase. 
The ratio of effective channel length also goes up from 40  to 65 . The parameters such 
as gate oxide thickness and threshold voltage increase slightly [8]. As a result, 
methodologies and models which can deal with such variation trends will play an 
increasingly essential role in circuit design.

3.1.2 Solution of the variation trend 
To deal with such variation trend, the variation-tolerant design is required. This means if 
there is process variability, we can change the way we design to make the integrated 
circuit has a better response. Making the circuit works at a high clock frequency and has 
low power consumption as well. This likes an interesting trade off. There is no free lunch, 
you win and at the same time you lose. For example, as Figure 3.2 shows, we can make 
the transistor size larger, such as increasing the value of transistor length, this may make 
the device circuit less sensitive to process variation. In this way, we can get a better 
probability in frequency, but we need to pay it by higher power consumption and size, so 
it is a cost factor. Hence, we need to balance power consumption and frequency by using 
variation tolerance design. The approaches to achieve the variation tolerance design 
include worst-case design, careful choice of logic styles, self-adapting design, etc [7].

3.2 SRAM cell 
Embedded memory is one kind of integrated on-chip memory which can support the core 
on chip to accomplish particular functions and communication between cores. With its 
high performance and wide bus-width capability, embedded memory becomes an 
essential component in VLSI. Hence, in this project, we will analyze the impact of 
process variation on memory cell performance, particularly on SRAM cell stability. There 
are different kinds of embedded memory, for example, DRAM, FRAM, MRAM, 
PCRAM, FLASH, and SRAM [7]. Recently, many applications are using embedded 
memory, particularly present a high interest in SRAM.  
6 
 
 
 
SRAM refers to static random access memory. Due to its general and critical feature of 
memory, SRAM yield is very worth to study. As density is a very important factor for 
memory, SRAM uses the smallest device sizes compared with other kinds of memories 
[9]. Because the random dopant fluctuation can result in the threshold voltage variability, 
the gate area can be influenced. Due to this point, the smaller sized devices being used in 
a memory, the more impacts of random dopant fluctuation. The complex read and write 
requirement of SRAM cells need to be satisfied by a careful design, so that SRAM can 
perform a stable operation [9]. However, the parameter variability can cause the memory 
cell various. With the sensitivity of SRAM yield to process variation is increasing, a 
statistical analysis of PVT variation effects using Monte Carlo simulation is required.  
 
3.2.1 Classical 6T SRAM 
The classical design of SRAM memory cell usually uses six-transistor CMOS 
architecture. This is due to good electrical features of that architecture, for instance, 
power consumption, noise immunity, speed, and so on. Here, we proposed a 6T SRAM to 
illustrate basic structure, working principle, and the operations of SRAM. The schematic 
of 6T SRAM shows in Figure 3.3.

3.2.2 Working principle of 6T SRAM 
In a six-transistor CMOS SRAM cell, there are four transistors formed as two 
cross-coupled inverters which are used for store each bit of data. These two cross-coupled 
inverters have two states which can be used to indicate 0 and 1. Another two transistors 
are used to control the access to the storage cell which refers to those two cross-coupled 
inverters when read and write operation happens. A SRAM generally uses six transistors 
to store data, sometimes other kinds of SRAM such as 8T, 10T also used to accomplish 
more than one port. 
 
The word line (WL in Figure 2.3) can enable the access to the SRAM cells, it controls the 
two access transistors M5 and M6 to decide when the cell can be connected to the bit 
lines (BLB and BL). Both read and write operations will use those two bit lines to 
transfer data [10]. 
 
3.2.3 Three operation states of 6T SRAM 
There are three different states of the SRAM cell, which include standby when the circuit 
is free, reading if the stored data need to perform reading, and writing when the storage 
cell requested to write the new contents [10].  
 
Standby state is when the word line is not enabled, those two access transistors M5 and 
M6 are not connect to the bit lines. In this situation, transistors M1 to M3 which refers to 
those two cross-coupled inverters will continue to enhance each other due to the 
connecting to the supply voltage.  
 
When the SRAM cell is requested to perform reading, we can consider the reading 
content of the memory is 0, stored at Q, and 1 is stored at QB. In the beginning of the 
read cycle, both of the bit lines should be precharged to a logical 1, then enable the word 
line to enable the access transistors M5 and M6. The second stage is when the data which 
should be stored in Q and QB now need to be transferred to the bit lines. As we can see 
from the figure3.4, because both QB and BLB are one, then there is nothing happens 
between these two points. For the right hand side, BL is precharged to 1 and Q is 0 now, 
so the capacitance on the right hand side would be discharged. If the reading content is a 
1, then the operation should be opposite, this means BLB will be pulled tend to 0 by 
discharging the capacitance on the left hand side. Then these two bit lines will present a 
small difference, and they reach a sense amplifier. As the sensitivity of sense amplifier is 
higher, the speed of the read operation will be faster.

In the beginning of write cycle, a value should be applied to be stored to the bit lines by 
using the write driver. If it is a 0, we would apply a 0 to the bit lines. For example, 
making BLB to 1 and discharging BL to 0. When we wish to write a 1, this will be 
accomplished by inverting the logical values on the bit lines. At the same time, the word 
line should be enabled to control the access of the data. 
 
3.3 Statistical analysis 
This project proposed the statistical analysis to investigate the influence of 
process-voltage-temperature variations to the performance of integrated circuit. Although 
there are many approaches utilized to analysis and address process variability, most of 
these methodologies are based on statistical modeling and mathematical optimization 
methods. This is because statistical analysis not only illustrates the deviation from 
expected circuit performance, but also analyzes the deviation from intended parameter 
variations.  
 
3.3.1 Corner analysis 
In this project, various process corners would be used to study delay and power variation 
of particular circuit by using Monte Carlo simulations. Corners can be considered as 
9 
 
 
 
obvious natures of the objective. Process corners can be simply defined as a vector of 
extreme values of all parameters [11]. 
 
Traditional corner analysis refers to checking all process corners which come from the 
extreme values of all parameters by running static timing analysis (STA). It is attempts to 
assure that all the corners meet the circuit timing constraints. As the number of process 
corners is increasing, the traditional corner analysis is becoming expensive [11]. After 
130nm technology library node coming up, the circuit design based on three kinds of 
corners, which are Typical, Worst, and Best corners. The typical corners based on both 
worst and best extreme corners, and they generally used to present the power dissipation 
under nominal conditions. Worst corners associated with high temperature, low supply 
voltage, and slow-slow process, they could result in worst timing delay. The Best corners 
associated with low temperature, high supply voltage, and Fast-Fast process to reach a 
perfect performance [12]. 
 
As the cost of the traditional corner analysis is increasing, an alternative method can be 
used which is linear-time method for STA. This approach can cover all process corners in 
a single pass which can present a more accurate result [11]. 
 
3.3.2 Statistical model vs. corner model 
In statistical model, the parameter variations can be defined in terms of statistical 
distributions. It is not hard to see that statistical model can be considered as the sum of 
the various corner cases. On the other words, the corner models seems to be the specific 
example of the statistical model, as there are extreme values in the statistical model. With 
the high requirements of the circuit design, designers can not only rely on the corner 
models to produce a better design [1]. In this situation, the statistical models are needed 
by creating the large number of Monte Carlo simulations. 
 
3.3.3 NMOS variation and PMOS variation determination 
As explained in [13], a Gaussian distribution is safe assumption for statistical analysis. 
We can consider that the process parameters follow a Gaussian distribution, so that the 
NMOS and PMOS variation can be evaluated by knowing the values of extreme process 
parameter. We can directly get these values from the vendorÕs corner model libraries. If 
sometimes these values are not given, they can be evaluated by using the silicon vendorÕs 
process documentation. Considering the parameter of device models as Pj, then the 
distribution of it is: 
 
Pj = agauss ( PjTT,
1
2
(PjFF ? PjSS),   ?) , ?j               (1) 
10 
 
 
 
Where,PjTT, PjFF and PjSS  are the values of parameter for the typical, fast, and slow 
libraries, and ? is the sigma difference between the fast and slow libraries. As the 
correlation of NMOS and PMOS is very important, it cannot be ignored. We need to add 
this factor, so that the equation of creating the statistical models is more accurate. 
Correlation in the statistical model evaluated by using the value of parameter in this form:  
 
            Pj = Ãc ? Pjc + Ã1 ? c ? Pju, ?                        (2) 
 
Where c can be considered as the correlation factor, ??? is the correlated components 
and ??? is the uncorrelated components of ??. And both of them can take in equation (1). 
Equation (2) follows the equation: 
 
?Pj
2 ? ?Pjc
2 + ?Pju
2 
This means, both correlated and uncorrelated components result in Pj. By combining 
equation (2) and (1), the final form of can be created as follows:  
 
Pj = PjTT + 
1
2
(PjFF ? PjSS)(ÃC ? aguass (0, 1, ?) + Ã1 ? c ? agauss(0,1, ?)), ?j 
 
This equation can be used to create a statistical device model. 
 
3.3.4 Key elements of statistical circuit analysis 
3.3.4.1 Extraction of statistical device models 
To create a statistical device model, the designers need to extract the model parameters 
which can perform the circuit simulation. For example, there is a device model which 
refers to the Spice Level-1 MOSFET model. The parameters of this model can be 
extracted from the measurements of current, charge, and voltage. By measuring many 
devices, we can characterize the variability in those parameters have extracted, hence, 
there will be large amount of cases can be simulated. After analyzing the result of those 
simulations, the designer may clearly see the effects of the parameter variations [8]. 
 
However, there are some limitations for this method, such as high computational costs, 
large number of data collection, and potential errors during performance estimating. 
Thereby, the worst-case analysis methods or many other analysis techniques should be 
used to get the reliable and accurate statistics.  
11 
 
 
 
3.3.4.2 Sensitivity analysis  
We can use sensitivity analysis to analyze the influences of the parameter variations. In 
some situations, it is easier to extract sets of the parameters than predict the effects to the 
device model. In those situations, we can consider that the variability propagate from one 
parameter P to another parameter Q, and Q is a function of P, where Q= f(P) [8]. 
 
In order to evaluate the value of f, Monte Carlo or other sampling methodologies are 
often used. Sensitivity analysis also can be used through a first-order expansion of 
function f :  
 
? + Æ? = ?(? + Æ?) 
 
Where, ÆQ Å  |
¶f
¶f
| ÆP, and ?P and ?Q are the standard deviations of parameters P and Q. 
?Q can be evaluated by a normal distribution. As result, the impact of the parameter P 
variations on device models can be derived [8]. 
 
3.3.4.3 Worst-case analysis 
The different of components of P are sometimes correlated. That correlation of P is 
needed to make an accurate statistical analysis. The worst-case analysis is the most 
common approach for evaluating the implications of correlated and random variations. 
Consider a device model performance is z, and it is a function of model parameters P, 
refers to z = f (P) [8]. Because of the variability of parameters P, the performance of the 
device model is variable. To evaluate the quality of the design is the goal of worst-case 
analysis. The yield of the design can be considered as the measure, it is defined as the 
percentage of the integrated circuits that meet the specifications made by the designer. As 
simulating such large amount of the circuits is very expensive, worst-case analysis is a 
better method to measure the yield of the design. 
 
3.3.4.4 Spatial modeling and mismatch analyses 
Device matching plays an essential role in analog circuit design, during this process, a 
series of work has been done to analyze and model issues. Device matching also arouse a 
concern in high performance digital circuits. 
 
According to [8], consider ?P is the variance in some parameters between two devices. In 
ideal case, if ?P =0, it means it is a perfect matching. However, we cannot always 
achieve such perfect matching, and this situation produce a sense of possible mismatch. 
And we need to take measures to reduce this mismatch. 
12 
 
 
 
One situation is if the two devices are totally independent, then the variation of mismatch 
is twice variation of each device. Another case is if any of the device variation resulted 
from the device area, and when the potential source of variability can be ÒaveragedÓ out 
for the larger devices, then the variation of mismatch based on both the potential statistics 
and the size of each device. In this case, it may reach a better matching by paying the cost 
of making the circuit structure larger. 
 
The third situation is the mismatch resulted from the distance between two devices. A 
helpful evaluation for this is to make the variation of the mismatch to be proportional to 
the square of the distance of the two devices. The helpful method to get a better matching 
under this situation is making the two devices on the die as closer as possible. 
 
A final case is if there is some deterministic spatial process variability. In the early stage, 
this kind of systematic variability must be considered as random. Consider a parameter P, 
its variations are systematic and the total variations can be formed follow this equation: 
 
P =  P0 +  F(x, y, ?) + P?? 
 
Where P0  is the mean value of the device, function F express the device spatial 
distribution of P, ?defined as a vector of random parameters of that function. We can 
consider P?? to the unexplained random parameter variation. If the information of (x, y) is 
unavailable, then the parameter P can only be considered as a random distribution which 
has the variation associated with the maximum deviation resulted from F. One method is 
to consider x and y have the random distribution across the die, then use such distribution 
to evaluate the function F. Generally, this approach will increase the total variation of P. 
 
3.4 Circuit level simulation using Monte Carlo 
Monte Carlo is a computational method which based on repeated various sampling to 
evaluate their results. It is usually used in simulating analysis and mathematical systems. 
In the integrated circuit simulation using Monte Carlo method, our goal is to simulate 
various parameters simultaneously, and make statistical analysis for the variability of the 
performance of the circuit [14]. This performance can refers to quantifying the statistical 
variation of circuit delay and power. Matlab is matrix laboratory, it is a mathematical 
computing environment which can plot the functions and various data [15]. Hspice is 
usually used for accurate simulation for integrated circuits, and it is an effective tool for 
simulation. 
 
According to Figure 3.5, the procedure of Monte Carlo simulation is firstly choose a 
particular circuit to study. Secondly, extracting all parameter values randomly use 
respective Gaussian distributions. All parameters can be considered independent to each 
13 
 
 
 
other. In the third stage, parameters can be applied to circuit to produce a particular 
instance. Fourthly, simulate those instances using HSPICE to measure the circuit output 
parameters. The read time and write time are proposed as the output parameters of the 
SRAM cell in this project. Finally, go back to the second step and repeat it again and 
again for N times. Then Matlab can be used to show all the results in a graph, so that we 
can easily see how the value of the read time and write time changes.

3.5 Statistical Blockade  
For the circuits in nanoscale, process-induced random variations are dramatically 
increased in devices. Such variations may include random dopant fluctuations, line edge 
roughness, and gate oxide variation. This roused a growing concern in the field of circuit 
reliability with statistical process variation. As circuits like SRAM and flip flops are high 
replicated, there are millions of cells in one chip. We can consider the cell failure as the 
rare event, in this situation, a rare statistical event could easily cause the whole system 
failure. As we can see from the Figure3.6 [16],   
 
14 
 
 
 
 
Fig 3. 6 Millions of memory cells on the chip [16] 
On the other hand, the existing techniques which are used to test and find the rare events 
are not performing so well.  For example, standard Monte Carlo is an efficient method 
to sampling and mathematical systems. It can be used to detect the statistical rare events, 
however, for such high replicated circuits like SRAM, there should be a large amount of 
simulation, so it will cost of time when sampling the rare circuit events. As we need to 
generate a large number of simulations if we use standard Monte Carlo simulation 
method, the experiment would be much expensive although such method is accurate. 
Compared with standard Monte Carlo simulation, statistical blockade mainly focus the 
Monte Carlo to the rare events. So the generating by statistical blockade is much cheaper 
than standard Monte Carlo simulation [3]. 
 
Hence, how to propose a fast and accurate method for generating an accurate prediction 
of the rare circuit event under PVT variation is important. In this situation, the statistical 
blockade (SB) method is increasingly concerned. In this project, we will propose to 
consider statistical blockade approach first followed by other techniques. 
 
3.5.1 The basic idea of calling Statistical Blockade 
As we analyzed before, the standard Monte Carlo simulation is too slow to model the rare 
events. Therefore we need to speed up the simulation of the critical events. If we can 
focus the simulation only on the rare events, it should be faster. The rare events can be 
defined as the tail part of the distribution. As analyzed in [17], the Importance Sampling 
might help us to sample the tail points of the distribution [17], however, it will change the 
statistics of these tail points. Thus, we also need to raise reliability of the statistics. 
 
In this project, we proposed the Statistical Blockade method to do a very efficient and 
novel simulation on the rare circuit events. Firstly, we can only focus on the critical 
events so that the simulation samples can be reduced. Secondly, unlike the Importance 
Sampling, Statistical Blockade would not change the statistics of the rare events. This 
may increase the reliability of the evaluation of the rare circuit events. Thirdly, this 
technique use mathematics of Extreme Value Theory [18] to model the tail part of the 
15 
 
 
 
distribution, so that we can build the classifier to efficiently filter the samples and block 
the points which are unlikely to fail. 
 
3.5.1.1 Use the Extreme Value Theory to model the rare events 
EVT help us use a mathematical method to build the model of the tail part of the 
distribution [16]. Consider that ? is the threshold of the cumulative distribution (CDF) 
F(x). This means the tail part of the distribution is consisted of the values above t. 
Through this project, we consider the upper tail as the probability to fail in circuit 
production. Then the conditional CDF which exceed the threshold t can be defined as 
below: 
 
??(?) =  
?(? + ?) ? ?(?)
1 ? ?(?)
 ??? ? > 0 
 
Now we want a similar result of the tail part, and this can be done by the important 
distribution of the Extreme Value Theory, which refers to Generalized Pareto distribution. 
It can be defined as follows: 
??,?(?) =  {
1 ? (1 +
??
?
)
1
?Ú
 , ? ­ 0
1 ? ??
?
?Ú               , ? = 0
 
 
Then we can fit GPD to the conditional CDF.  
 
3.5.1.2 Fitting the model and prediction 
We can fit the GPD by evaluating the value of a and k, so that we can fit GPD to a 
conditional CDF. There are several options available to achieve this idea, such as moment 
matching, maximum likelihood estimation(MLE) and probability weighted moments 
(PWM) [27]. We choose PWM in this project because it seems to have lower bias [19] , 
moreover it does not have the convergence problems of MLE. 
 
3.5.2 The implementation of the Statistical Blockade 
The idea of Statistical Blockade method also can be shown in Figure3.7 [3]. As we can 
see from the graph, generating the large amount of the Monte Carlo samples is easy and 
cheap, however, simulation is costly.

3.6 Low-leakage SRAM design with dual Vt transistors 
3.6.1 The power consumption of a circuit 
The power consumption of a circuit can be divided into two categorize, one is dynamic 
power, and the other one is static power. Previously, dynamic power is the main power 
dissipation of the whole circuit. However, recently the static power is increasingly 
important in the total power consumption [20]. As the technology scaling, how to reduce 
the increasing static power is one of the most important problem in the design of VLSI 
systems. 
 
Static power is produced by many reasons, for instance, subthreshold leakage, 
reverse-biased ?? junctions, drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), gate-induced drain 
leakage, punch through currents gate oxide tunneling, and hot carrier effects [20]. And 
the subthreshold leakage is the dominant element of the static power. Hence, static power 
can be defined as the product of supply voltage and the leakage current which expressed 
in the equation below: 
 
??????? = ??????????? 
 
Leakage power is the power dissipated by the transistors which are not active. Therefore, 
the transistors which are not active should be found, and then we need to calculate the 
leakage power for each of them and add them together.  
 
17 
 
 
 
3.6.1 The idea of dual threshold voltage design 
Previously, we want to reduce the dynamic power consumption, hence, the supply 
voltage should be decreased. This would be achieved by reducing the threshold voltage of 
the transistor. According to the equation below, when the threshold voltage is decreased, 
the subthreshlod current will be increased. The leakage power will be increase as well. 
 
????????????? = ?0????
?
?
(1 ? ?
???
?? )?
(???????)
???  
 
Where, ?0 is the movement speed of the carrier, ??? is the capacitance of the oxide 
layer,  ? and ? are the width and length of the CMOS transistor, ? and ?? are the 
thermal approximation constant and the thermal voltage, ??? is the threshold voltage of 
the transistor. 
 
As we analyzed above, recently the leakage power is increasing dramatically, thus, how 
to reduce the leakage power is of growing concern. Previously, some researchers have 
solved this problem. The asymmetric SRAM cells were used to reduce the leakage power 
[21]. The circuit level techniques which add the device-level optimization were also 
proposed to provide a forward body-biasing method. This method could reduce the 
leakage power in hold and active status [22]. And the technique of the dynamic ?? has 
also been carried out to decrease the leakage power of the SRAM memory cells [23]. 
However, although those methods could reduce the leakage power of SRAM cells, most 
of them would cause the increase in the area of the chip and the decrease in the yield of 
the circuits. 
 
In this project, we proposed a method of low-leakage SRAM design by using three 
different types of the memory cells, which is created by various threshold voltage 
assignments. This is because the leakage power could be reduced by using a high 
threshold voltage for some transistors. We consider all types of memory cells are 
symmetric.  
 
There are four main merits of using dual threshold voltage design [24] compared with 
previous method. Firstly, there is no hardware overhead at all. Secondly, the read time 
and write time would not overhead as well. Thirdly, the method would not change the 
SRAM design a lot. Fourthly, it could make an improvement on the static noise margin 
under process variation.  
 
 
 
 
18 
 
 
 
3.7 Static Noise Margin 
3.7.2 The concept of static noise margin 
The cell stability is one of the most important aspects of the SRAM cell. It influences the 
soft-error rate and the sensitivity of the memory to process tolerances and operating 
conditions. In this project, the Static Noise Margin of 6T SRAM under process variation 
was measured with all its status [24].  
 
Static Noise Margin (SNM) can be defined as the biggest value of the noise voltage 
allowed between the two inverters in the SRAM memory cell, and with this value the 
memory cell can still maintain its states [25]. We can define the noise voltage as ??. The 
Static Noise Margin of the SRAM can be considered as the maximum value of the ?? 
that can be added at the point ÒQÓ and ÒQBÓ without changing the data stored in the 
memory cell. As shown in Figure3.8 [24], he estimating structure of the measuring the 
SNM can be presented like the flip-flop.

Fig 3. 8 A flip-flop comprised of two inverters. Static-noise voltage sources V, are 
included. 
 
3.7.3 The calculation of Static Noise Margin 
As we know the structure of the SRAM cell, there are two cross-coupled inverters in the 
memory cell. A graphical method of evaluating the Static Noise Margin is by drawing the 
characteristics of one inverter and mirroring it. Then find the maximum possible square 
between those two characteristics. The original and mirrored inverter characteristics are 
shown in Figure3.9 [26], they can be considered as the two functions y = F1(x) and 
y = F2(x). The distance between the two curves is the diagonal of the square, multiply 
the value of diagonal by cos45, then we can get the value of SNM.  
19 
 
 
 
 
Fig 3. 9 Graphical representation of the Static Noise Margin (Figure from [26]) 
 
There is a procedure we need to take to estimate the diagonal of the maximum square. We 
need two coordinate systems to calculate it. One is the normal one, which refers to the 
(?, ?) coordinate system. And the other one is (u, v) coordinate system. The later one is 
rotated through 45¡ with the normal coordinate system [26]. At given u values, the 
length of diagonal can be measured by the subtraction of the values of v in original and 
mirrored characteristics.  
 
To get ?1 under (?, ?) coordinate system, its value in (?, ?) coordinate system need to 
be transferred to (?, ?) coordinate system. Operator ? [26] shown below can be used 
to finish rotating the (?, ?) system, and transfer it to (?, ?) system. 
 
???? = (
1 Ã2      ? 1 Ã2ÚÚ
1 Ã2       1 Ã2ÚÚ
) ??? = ???? 
Where ??? and ???? are the column vectors (?, ?) and (?, ?). ? and ? could be defined 
as the function of ? and ? as following expressions. 
 
? =
1
Ã2
? + 
1
Ã2
? 
20 
 
 
 
? = ?
1
Ã2
? + 
1
Ã2
? 
 
If we substitute the function ?1, we could get the following expression: 
 
? = Ã2?1 (
1
Ã2
? +
1
Ã2
?) + ? 
 
To get ?2, ?1 should be mirrored in the system of (?, ?), and respect to ? = ? at the 
same time. The matrix form of the mirroring is as follows: 
 
? = (
0   1
1   0
) 
 
So that we can get the next formulation showed below: 
 
????? = (
1 Ã2Ú     ? 1 Ã2Ú
1 Ã2Ú      1 Ã2Ú
) (
0    1
1    0
) ??? = ???? 
which gives: 
 
? =
?1
Ã2
? +
1
Ã2
? 
? =
1
Ã2
? +
1
Ã2
? 
 
If we substitute the function ?2, we can get following formulation: 
 
? = Ã2?2 (
?1
Ã2
? +
1
Ã2
?) ? ? 
 
Now the length of diagonal can be provided by the subtraction of the values of v in 
original and mirrored characteristics.

4. Methods  
The methods and algorithm proposed in this project are explained in this section. It also 
presents the procedure for developing these methods. 
 
4.1 Analysis using the Statistical Blockade method 
4.1.1 The algorithm of Statistical Blockade method  
The Statistical Blockade approach is the basic idea to optimize the analysis and 
simulation of the critical circuit events. Compared to standard Monte Carlo, it provides a 
better performance on the simulation time of the rare events.  
 
Supposed that the size of training sample is ?0 (e.g. 1000), the size of total size is ?(e.g. 
10000), and the percentage ??(e.g. 99 ) and ??(e.g. 97 ). The Algorithm 1 [3] of the 
Statistical Blockade can be shown as follows: 
 
Algorithm 1: For Statistical Blockade method

9:   ( ,  ) =       (     ?  ) 
Fig 4. 1 The algorithm of the Statistical Blockade method [3] 
 
Initially, the simulation of a small amount of samples used HSPICE were carried out, 
which are the training samples for the classifier. And examine two thresholds, one is ? 
which can be tested by the percentage ??, and the other one is the threshold of classifier 
?? which can provide a safety margin. And the classification threshold can be evaluated 
by the percentage Pc. In the statistical parameter space, the   points can be generated 
using the function      Ca   ( ). These points should be stored in a matrix, and the 
input dimensionality is the number of parameters we considered. Each point in the 
dimensions is regarded as a row of ?. y is consisted of the output values of Monte 
Carlo simulations using HSPICE. Then we need to train and build the classifier by using 
22 
 
 
 
the function  u   C ass     ( , y,  c), where  c  is the classification threshold. After 
getting the classifier, the points in ? are filtered, and the ÒbodyÓ points are blocked, then 
only return the ÒtailÓ points of the distribution. Now we need to fit the GPD to 
conditional CDF, this is done by evaluate the parameters   and   by using the function 
F   P (y    ?  ). Then the GPD model can be used to evaluate the statistical metrics for 
rare circuit events.  
 
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) [27] are used as the classifier in this project, which 
is implemented as: LIBSVM [28], SVMlight [29] or WEKA [30]. There are 4 basic 
kernels of SVM , linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid. 
Associated with the purpose of this project, the kernel RBF was chosen as it can 
nonlinearly map samples into a higher dimensional space.  
 
Note that the classifier itself is body biased, the number of body points is much more than 
that of tail points. It will block the body points (nontail points) according to the 
classification threshold and the tail threshold, and keep the classifier try to find the body 
points as many as possible no matter if there is any tail point misclassified. Hence, the 
detected tail points would be misclassified. However, it caused another problem of how 
to reduce the misclassifying. In order to solve this problem, a method of weight scale to 
increase the weight of the tail points was proposed. By setting the value of the weight 
scale of the tail points, an appropriate number of the classified tail points can be obtained 
which make a safer margin than just use the classification threshold. For instance, if we 
just use the classification threshold which refers to 97 , there should be 300 tail points 
detected. On the other hand, it detected 349 tail points while using the technique of 
weight scale. 
  
4.1.2 The algorithm of finding the minimal classification threshold 
After accomplishing the method of Statistical Blockade, we consider that if we can 
further speed up the simulation of the rare circuit events. For given tail threshold, 
consider that we can find the minimal classification threshold and minimal training 
samples of the classifier which can still ensure to cover all the true tail points. If we could 
minimize the classification threshold and the training samples by this way, the total 
simulation would be reduced. Therefore, we could make the simulation of the rare circuit 
events faster.  
 
To achieve this idea, the minimal classification threshold is required to be chosen. Then 
according to the given tail threshold and classification threshold, we could find the 
minimal training samples. Refer to figure4.2, an algorithm of setting the minimal 
classification threshold [31] was listed.

Fig 4. 2 The algorithm of choosing the minimal classification threshold [31] 
 
For this algorithm, there were 2000 training samples to train the classifier and there are 
10000 total samples. Firstly, the tail points of the whole samples are required to be 
selected. All samples were simulated by implementing the function called ? = ????(?). 
Refer the expression, ? is the simulation result, for example, the read time or write time 
of the SRAM cell. ? is the vector which contains the true tail points by using the 
function ? = ??? ???  ?(?, ?). Function ? ??(?    ) is used to estimate the number of 
the tail points. According to Figure 4.2, step 7 to step 12 are completed to accomplish the 
method of Statistical Blockade. ? is the result from the simulation of training samples. 
Meanwhile, the SVM classifier is trained and returned from function 
? =  ?   ? ?   ? ??(?, ?, ??).  
 
As soon as the classifier was built, set classification threshold equal to tail threshold 
firstly, then classify and block the body points in ? using the classifier. The high 
performance was achieved by focusing on the filtered tail points simulating in HSPICE. 
The evaluation was based on the comparison of the size of the current tail points ?  and 
the size of the true tail points ?. If     , it indicated that the current ?? cannot select 
24 
 
 
 
all of the tail points. Hence, the value of the classification threshold ?? required to 
increase. For each time it increased by 1 . Then repeat all of the steps again and again, 
by modulating those parameters, the minimal value for ?? can be eventually detected 
while    is equal to  .  
 
4.1.3 The algorithm of finding the minimal training samples 
Now the minimal classification threshold is found and the tail threshold was given, the 
minimal number of training samples should be evaluated. Refer to Figure 3.4, it 
illustrates the algorithm of choosing the minimal number of training samples [31]. 
Compared to the previous algorithms, the number of training sample should be changed 
from 100 to 2000, with increasing 100 as intervals. Two conditions are required to select 
the minimal training sample. Firstly, the size of the current tail points  c is desired to 
equal to the size of the true tail points  . Secondly, the number of training samples which 
is larger than the current one also need to equal to the true tail points  .

4.2 Different deviations of parameters 
Since SRAM cell use very small transistors, the influences of process variation are the 
most important in SRAM design. The decrease of the transistor scale may cause the 
increase of the process variation [32]. For example, if the scale of the transistors of the 
SRAM is decrease, the variation of threshold voltage would be widened [32] like 
Figure4.4. The simplest way to model this increased variation is to make the Gaussian 
distribution with a higher standard deviation.  
 
 
Fig 4. 4 The Gaussian distribution with higher deviation [32] 
 
The deviation of the Gaussian distribution presents how much variation is from the mean 
value. If the points of the Gaussian distribution are very close to the mean value, then 
there is a low deviation. While, if there are a large range of the data points, the deviation 
should be high. Therefore, different deviations would result of different Gaussian 
distributions of parameters.  
 
Refer to the discussion in introduction section, the Statistical Blockade method can be 
optimized by minimizing the classification threshold and the training samples of the 
classifier. The value of the selected classification threshold and the number of the training 
samples was unstable, while increasing the deviation of the Gaussian distribution. Hence, 
how the value of the selected classification threshold and the number of training samples 
would be changed in this situation is a question. The answer of this question could be 
answered by calling the method of the SB and the idea of minimizing the classification 
26 
 
 
 
threshold and training samples of the classifier. The results of our simulation will present 
in section five. 
 
4.3 Low leakage SRAM design 
To design a low leakage SRAM cell, the first task to be completed is estimate the leakage 
power of the SRAM cell in each state. The active transistors need to be detected in terms 
of measuring the leakage current. Then use the leakage current multiply by the supply 
voltage, we can get the leakage power. Add the leakage power for each inactive transistor 
together to get the leakage power of the whole memory cell.  
 
For instance, during the hold state, as we can see from the Figure 4.5, the transistor M1, 
M4, M6 are not active during this status. Thus, the leakage power (static power) of those 
three transistors should be measured. As we consider that word line is closed, bit line (BL) 
and bit line bar (BLB) were stably logical 1, and the data Q stored in the cell equalled to 
zero. The leakage power can be calculated based on the following equation, 
 
???????? = (????????1 + ????????4 + ????????6)??? 
 
 
Fig 4. 5 The schematic of SRAM cell in hold state 
 
When the SRAM cell asked to perform as read operation, the word line is enable which 
make the transistors M5 and M6 active. Suppose that the initial data stored in the SRAM 
cell is Q=0 and QB=1, this make the transistors M3 and M4 active. As a result, during the 
27 
 
 
 
state of read, the transistors M1 and M4 are not active whose leakage powers need to be 
measured (Figure4.6). And the leakage power can be calculated as follows: 
 
???????? = (????????1 + ????????4)??? 
 
 
Fig 4. 6 The schematic of SRAM cell in read operation 
 
When the SRAM cell is asked to perform a write operation, the word line is enable as 
well. And also set the initial data stored in the memory cell to Q=0 and QB=1. As result, 
transistors M2, M3, M5, M6 are active. The leakage power of the circuit is consisted of 
the leakage power dissipated by transistor M1 and M4. It is the same as the read 
operation.  
 
Refer to the results obtained for read and write operation, the leakage power was 
relatively high. The design can be optimized by implementing a low leakage SRAM cell 
using dual threshold voltage transistor.  
 
In order to reduce the leakage power of the SRAM cell, three kinds of symmetric cell 
configurations were proposed. This means symmetric CMOS transistors in a cell have the 
same threshold voltages. Associated with Table3.2, the configuration C0 had no high 
threshold voltage transistors, all of the transistors in configuration C1 have the high 
threshold voltage, four of the transistors in configuration C2 have the high threshold 
voltage transistors, and two of the transistors in configuration C3 have the high threshold 
voltage transistors.  
28 
 
 
 
 
Table 1 The different configurations of low leakage design 
 
For each configuration (except for C0), there are two values of threshold voltage 
transistors, one is normal value of threshold voltage, the other one is high threshold 
voltage. It carried out with a problem that there were two kinds of threshold voltage in 
one circuit. To fix this problem, two models are proposed in the simulation, and each 
model respect to each kind of threshold voltage. By varying the value of high threshold 
voltage from the normal value (0.46V) to 0.67V, the changes in the leakage current for 
different configurations were found.  
 
4.4 Static Noise Margin 
As we all know, there are three states of SRAM cell, standby, read, write respectively. 
The measurements of Static Noise Margin for those three states are slightly different.  
 
When the SRAM cell is in standby state, the word line is not enabled, this means the 
access transistors M5 and M6 are closed. Hence, just the two cross-coupled inverters are 
holding the data, which is shown is Figure4.7. Then add a static noise voltage at the point 
Q and QB, and do DC analysis. We can get the butterfly in Figure4.8, and the high 
performance model with constant value of threshold voltage and gate oxide thickness 
were proposed. The supply voltage is    = 1 . The SNM of the SRAM cell in this 
state can be defined as the side of the maximum square.

If the SRAM cell is required to perform the read operation, the access transistors cannot 
be ignored any more (M5 and M6). The two bit lines need to be precharged to logical 1 to 
perform the read operation, this means the two bit lines can be connected to VDD. In this 
situation the SRAM circuit can be presented as Figure4.9. The static noise sources are 
also added to the points Q and QB to do the DC analysis. The two characteristics of the 
inverters are showed in Figure4.10.

we give Q and QB a static noise source, different characteristics could be presented. The

5. Results 
The results of the project got from the simulation will be presented in this section, and an 
analysis and discussion of the results related to the initial objectives will be explained.  
  
In this project, two main parts of work were carried out. One is using the method of 
Statistical Blockade to do a very fast and efficient Monte Carlo simulation of rare circuit 
events on SRAM cell. The idea of further speeding up the simulation of the rare circuit 
events on SRAM by selecting the minimal classification threshold and minimal training 
samples is carried out. This is based on the the Statistical Blockade method. The second 
part of the work is to make a low power design of SRAM cell using multi-threshold 
voltage transistors. This method does not only reduce the leakage power of the SRAM 
cell, but also improves the Static Noise Margin of the memory cell under process 
variations. 
 
How PVT variations affect the performance of the circuits have analyzed. The working 
principle of the standard Monte Carlo simulation has been reviewed. It is an accurate and 
basic technique for statistical analysis. The Statistical Blockade technique to speed up the 
simulation of rare circuit events was carried out. Moreover, the minimal classification 
threshold and the minimal number of training samples for the classifier were evaluated. 
Finally, the method of dual threshold voltage design was carried out to decrease the 
leakage power of the SRAM cell. 
 
5.1 Analysis of PVT variation using the Standard Monte Carlo 
As the influence of the variability of the parameters on the performance of the SRAM 
cell are desired to analyzed, the standard Monte Carlo method is carried out in this 
project. Different numbers of parameters that are varied with Gaussian distributions were 
applied in this part.  
 
Initially, one parameter was varied in the simulation. Following the procedure of the 
standard Monte Carlo simulation, firstly, the testing circuit is an SRAM cell. Secondly, 
all parameter values are extracted randomly and use the respective Gaussian distributions. 
In this case, the parameter is the threshold voltage of the NMOS, and the temperature is 
held at 25? and the supply voltage is VDD=1.0V. In the next stage, a parameter can be 
applied to circuit to produce a particular instance. Then, these instances are simulated 
using HSPICE to measure the read time and write time of the SRAM cell. Finally, return 
to the second step and repeat it again and again for 1000 times. Then Matlab can be used 
to show all the results in a graph, so that we can easily see how the value of the read time 
or write time changes. 
 
32 
 
 
 
According to the High Performance nanometer model (provided on the Predictive 
Technology Model website), the nominal values of those parameters in the 45nm 
technology library of BPTM is L=45nm, W=90nm, the threshold voltage of NMOS 
(nvt)= 0.46893v, pvt= -0.49158v, and gate oxide thickness of NMOS (ntox)=1.2nm and 
ptox=1.3nm. The variations are considered as a Gaussian distribution that has a deviation 
of ±3? around of their nominal values. The threshold voltage of NMOS is swept using 
the Monte Carlo simulation under the Gaussian distribution as follows: 
 
nvt= agauss(0.46893v,0.093786v,3), 
 
The Gaussian distribution of the input parameter which refers to the threshold voltage of 
the NMOS is shown in figure5.1 in this case. The proportion of variation is 20 , and the 
deviation is ±3?. The initial value stored in the SRAM cell is Q=0 and QB=1. 
 
 
Fig 5. 1 The distribution of the threshold voltage of NMOS 
 
After repeating simulation for 1000 times, the plotting results of the read time and write 
time by using Matlab are shown in figure 5.2. The read time and write time varies as 
Gaussian distributions. 
 
  
Fig 5. 2 The results of read time and write time with one parameter variation 
33 
 
 
 
Next, two varying parameters under Gaussian distributions were proposed (figure5.3), 
which refer to the threshold voltage of NMOS and PMOS. The Gaussian distributions of 
these two parameters are swept as follows: 
 
nvt= agauss(0.46893v,0.093786v,3), 
pvt= agauss(-0.49158v,0.098316v,3), 
 
  
Fig 5. 3 The distributions for threshold voltage of NMOS and PMOS 
The working conditions of the SRAM cell is the same as when we varied one parameter. 
The temperature is held at 25?, and the supply voltage is VDD=1.0V. The initial value 
stored in the SRAM cell is also Q=0 and QB=1. The difference is two parameters were 
extracted this time. Then these instances were simulated using HSPICE to measure the 
read time and write time of the SRAM cell. After sweeping 1000 times, the variations of 
read time and write time got using Matlab is as follows: 
 
  
Fig 5. 4 The simulation results of read time and write time of the SRAM with two 
parameter variations 
When three parameters are proposed, different distributions for read time and write time 
34 
 
 
 
of the SRAM cell were presented. The Gaussian distributions are given as follows: 
 
nvt= agauss(0.46893v,0.093786v,3), 
pvt= agauss(-0.49158v,0.098316v,3), 
ntox= agauss(1.2n,0.24n,3), 
 
This time the three parameters we extracted are threshold voltage of NMOS, threshold 
voltage of PMOS, and the gate oxide thickness of NMOS. The deviation of the Gaussian 
distribution is ±3?, and the variation is 20 . Figure5.5 shows the variations of these three 
parameters. 
 
   
Fig 5. 5 The distributions of threshold voltage of NMOS, PMOS, and the gate oxide 
thickness of NMOS 
 
The read time and write time of the SRAM cell are then determined by simulating those 
instances using HSPICE. After sweeping 1000 times, the variations of read time and 
write time got using Matlabe are as follows: 
 
  
Fig 5. 6 The simulation results for the read time and write time of the SRAM cell under 
three parameter variations 
Finally, four parameter variations were carried out to see if that can result in any 
35 
 
 
 
difference on the read time and write time of the SRAM cell. The Gaussian distributions 
are given as follows: 
 
nvt= agauss(0.46893v,0.093786v,3), 
pvt= agauss(-0.49158v,0.098316v,3), 
                       ntox= agauss(1.2n,0.24n,3), 
                       ptox= agauss(1.3n,0.26n,3), 
 
The four parameters we extracted this time are threshold voltage of NMOS, threshold 
voltage of PMOS, gate oxide thickness of NMOS, and the gate oxide thickness of PMOS. 
The Gaussian distribution of those four parameters got using Matlab are as follows: 
 
 
Fig 5. 7 The distributions of threshold voltage of NMOS, PMOS and the gate oxide 
thickness of NMOS, PMOS 
After sweeping the parameters for 1000 times, the results of the simulations were given 
to Matlab. We got the distributions of the read time and write time of the SRAM cell as 
shown in Figure5.8.

of the SRAM cell. The results can be used as the judgement for the performance of 
integrated circuit. 
 
5.2 Results for Statistical Blockade  
5.2.1 The idea of Statistical Blockade  
The idea and the algorithm of the Statistical Blockade were expressed in section four. To 
implement the SB approach, 1000 samples were firstly simulated using HSPICE as the 
training samples of the classifier, and then the results of the output parameters and the tail 
threshold of the distribution were plotted(set it as 99 ). This step is fast. Second, the 
training samples, the simulation results, and the classification threshold (we set it as 97 ) 
were used to train and build the classifier. This step is also fast and returns the classifier. 
The step of training the classifier can be shown use figure5.9. Among the 1000 samples, 
the blue points are the tail points, the red points are the body points.   
 
37 
 
 
 
 
Fig 5. 9 Training the classifier 
 
Third, 10,000 Monte Carlo samples were generated, these points are stored in the 
two-dimensional metrics as we consider the two parameter variations (the threshold 
voltage of PMOS and the threshold voltage of NMOS) with the Gaussian distributions. 
The deviation of the Gaussian distribution is ±3?, and the variation is 20 . Then the 
sample points are classified using the classifier we have built, and the nontail points are 
blocked. From that, we have 349 tail points. Finally, these 349 tail points were simulated 
using HSPICE to detect the fail events. The classification of generated Monte Carlo 
samples is shown below in figure5.10.

5.2.2 Comparing the Statistical Blockade with the Standard Monte 
Carlo Simulation 
The purpose of proposing the Statistical Blockade method is to make the simulation of 
statistical rare events more efficient when compared with the standard Monte Carlo 
simulation. Suppose that we generate 10000 samples, and want to find the points that 
would probably fail. Both the empirical method and Statistical Blockade are carried out 
to complete the work, and we will compare them.  
 
In the method of Statistical Blockade, 1000 samples were used to train the classifier. The 
tail threshold and classification threshold are set to 99  and 97  respectively. After 
simulating, the conditional CDF of the tail points with both the empirical method and 
Statistical Blockade are compared. The simulation using Statistical Blockade can detect 
almost all of the tail points. Figure5.11 illustrates that these two CDFs represent a good 
match.  
 
Fig 5. 11 Empirical vs. Statistical Blockade 
 
However, the number of the simulations required to detect such tail points for these two 
methods are different. As illustrated in the table2, in the Statistical Blockade method, 349 
tail points are picked up after classification. Hence, the total number of simulations used 
in Statistical Blockade is 1349 (1000+349). However, to detect the tail points of the 
39 
 
 
 
samples, the standard Monte Carlo needs 10000 Monte Carlo simulations. And the 
method of Standard Blockade can cover all of the tail points.  
 
Method  Standard Monte Carlo Statistical Blockade 
Number of simulation 10000 1349 
Tail points covered 99 99 
Table 2 The simulations times of Standard MC and SB and the tail points they covered 
 
As a result, the method of Statistical Blockade not only can detect the tail points 
accurately, but also speed up the simulation of rare circuit events by reducing the number 
of simulations. 
 
5.3 Evaluate the minimal classification threshold and training 
samples 
To accomplish the idea of further speeding up the statistical rare events simulation, the 
total number of simulations is required to be reduced. Therefore, the minimal 
classification threshold and training samples that can ensure all of the tail points are 
covered were desired to be evaluated.  
 
The 10000 samples were supposed to be generated, and the failure points among them 
respective to different tail region (1 , 2 , and 3 ) were required to be detected. This 
means the tail thresholds (t) are set to 99 , 98 , and 97  respectively. The minimal 
classification threshold of the classifier is chosen using the second algorithm. The 
classification threshold varied from 99  to 97 , and it is increased by 1  for each time. 
The third algorithm is used to evaluate the minimal number of training samples. Hence, 
the number of training samples of the classifier was changed from 100 to 2000, and each 
time changed by 100 samples. Suppose that four-dimensional data was used to train the 
classifier. This means there are four parameters variations that follow the Gaussian 
distributions. Such Gaussian distributions have a deviation of ±3? around their nominal 
values, and the variation is 20 . Table5.1 shows the minimal classification threshold and 
minimal training samples for each tail threshold. for an example, take the tail threshold of 
99  after the classification threshold and training samples were minimized, the total 
number of simulation is only 1037 (800+237), where 237 is the tail points picked up after 
classification.

Minimal classification threshold 98  97  96

Table 3 The minimal classification threshold and training samples for different tail 
threshold 
 
As the simulation is a cost of time, therefore, choosing the minimal classification 
threshold and training samples is a more efficient way to simulate the rare circuit events 
for SRAM cells. 
 
5.4 Different deviations of parameters with Statistical Blockade 
The idea of minimizing the classification threshold and the training samples of the 
classifier was accomplished to further speed up the simulation on rare circuit events. 
Wondering that if the deviation of each parameter was changed from 3? to 6?, and the 
Statistical Blockade method was used to sample and classify the tail points of each of 
them, is there any difference when the minimal classification threshold and minimal 
training samples required for each of them are investigated? 
 
This part is an implementation of minimizing the classification threshold and training 
samples. The deviation of each parameter variation was changed from 3? to 6?, and 
simulated 10,000 samples using HSPICE. Next the idea of minimizing the classification 
threshold and training samples of the classifier was called upon respect to different tail 
thresholds (1 , 2 , 3 ), and use this idea to choose the minimal classification threshold 
and training samples for each deviation. The results are shown in table4. 
 
As we can see from table4, for the same deviation of the parameter, the minimal 
classification threshold or minimal training sample will increase when the tail threshold 
increases. And with the deviation of parameter increasing for the same tail threshold, the 
true threshold voltage of the tail points decreased.

5.5 Low leakage SRAM design with dual threshold voltage transistors 
As mentioned previously, three configurations of the dual threshold voltage design were 
proposed. C1, C2 and C3 refer to all of the transistors using high threshold voltage, four 
transistors using high threshold voltage, and two transistors using high threshold voltage 
respectively. The leakage current was measured use HSPICE for each configuration in 
every state. For example, the leakage current is measured for those three configurations 
in standby state with the increased threshold voltage. The trend of the reduction on the 
leakage current is shown in figure5.12. 
 
As the leakage current is proportional to the leakage power, the trend of the leakage 
power is the same as the leakage current. Thus, the changes in the leakage current were 
measured. The leakage current reduction of each configuration was calculated as the 
threshold voltage increased. Refer to figure5.12, the leakage current reduction decreases 
as we move from C1 to C3. It also illustrate that the leakage current is decreasing for 
each configuration as the threshold voltage increased. Also, if the threshold voltage of all 
transistors within a cell is increased, the leakage current reduction is the highest. 
42 
 
 
 
 
Fig 5. 12 The reduction of leakage current for each configuration in standby state 
 
The reduction of the leakage current for the read operation and the write operation is 
measured as well. Figure 5.13 shows the changes in the leakage current reduction. As 
with the standby state, the leakage reduction is increased as the threshold voltage 
increases for each configuration. The leakage current reduction of the configuration C1 is 
the highest. 
 
Fig 5. 13 The reduction of leakage current for each configuration in read operation 
 
Figure 5.14 shows the changes in the leakage current reduction when an SRAM cell 
performs a write operation. It is the same as in the standby and read states: with the 
increase of the threshold voltage, the leakage current reduction increases for each 
configuration. The configuration C1 continues to have the highest leakage current 
reduction. 
43 
 
 
 
 
Fig 5. 14 The reduction of leakage current for each configuration in read operation 
 
Figure5.12 to figure5.14 show that for all states, the leakage current reduction is 
increased with the increase of threshold voltage on high ??  transistors in each 
configuration. It provides a good result for a low leakage design.  
 
However, the other output parameters, such as read delay, write delay, and Static Noise 
Margin of the SRAM cell are also very important factors of the circuit performance. Thus, 
a question emerges of how the low leakage design affects the read time, write time, and 
the SNM of the SRAM cell.  
 
Then the variety of the read time and write time of each configuration was measured. The 
purpose of this is to investigate whether increasing the threshold voltage will influence 
the read time and write time of the SRAM cell. Here, take the standby state as an 
example. Figure5.15 shows that the increase in read time of an SRAM cell for 
configuration C1 and C2 is very high when the threshold voltage increases. However, 
there is a very small increase for the read time of configuration C3. This means the 
increase in threshold voltage will result in a noticeable influence in configurations C1 and 
C2, but will not have much effect on the read time of configuration C3. 
 
44 
 
 
 
 
Fig 5. 15 The read time for each configuration in standby operation 
 
Figure5.16 shows the changes of the write time for each configuration in the hold state. It 
illustrates that the write time of configuration C1 increased dramatically when the 
threshold voltage increased. However, not all of the configurations increase the write 
time, for example, the write time of the configuration C3 decreases slightly with the 
threshold voltage increased for the high ?? transistors.  
 
 
Fig 5. 16 The write time for each configuration in standby operation 
 
As the Static Noise Margin is one of the most important factors of the performance of the 
SRAM cell, we also estimated the SNM for each of the configuration under process 
variation. We considered four varying parameters with the Gaussian distributions. The 
standard deviation of the Gaussian distributions is 3?, and the variation is 20 . As seen 
in Figure5.16, the SNMs of configuration C1 and C2 are improved. However, the SNM 
of configuration C3 is slightly decreased. 
45 
 
 
 
 
Fig 5. 17 The static noise margin for each configuration in standby operation 
Compare the Static Noise Margin of those three configurations. For each configuration, 
the threshold voltage of the high threshold voltage transistors is 0.67V, the threshold 
voltage of the low threshold voltage transistors is 0.46V. In this case, we take the SNM in 
standby state as an exmple. After simulating, the graph of Static Noise Margin for each 
configuration can be shown in figure18. As we can see, configuration C1 provide the best 
Static Noise Margin. The SNM of configuration C3 is the smallest one.  
 
 
Fig 5. 18 The SNM of each configuration in standby state 
  
To conclude, the increase of the threshold voltage for high ??  transistors in each 
configuration will result in the increase of the leakage reduction. The Static Noise Margin 
is also improved dramatically with configuration C1 and C2. However, the read time and 
write time of configuration C1 and C2 go up with the increasing threshold voltage.

6. Critical Evaluation 
The critical evaluation of the work have done refer to each objectives is explained in this 
section. 
 
? Analysis of PVT variation on SRAM cell using Statistical Blockade method, and 
compare this approach with standard MC. 
 
The first objective of the project is implementation of a method that could do an efficient 
simulation of rare circuit event for SRAM cells. This was completed by analyzing the 
PVT variation on SRAM cells using the Statistical Blockade method. We successfully 
built a classifier using SVM to classify the large amount of samples for such a 
high-replication circuit like SRAM, and blocked the non-tail points among them. 
Therefore, only the tail points filtered by the classifier required to be simulated. In this 
way, the number of simulations is reduced, and therefore an optimized simulation of rare 
events was developed. Comparing the Statistical Blockade with the standard Monte Carlo 
simulation, it presents a good match of detected tail points, and more importantly, it 
provides us an efficient way of simulating the critical events of SRAM cells. The 
technique of increasing the weight of the tail points is carried out to make the classifier 
bias to the tail part of the distribution, this will help us detect more tail points to improve 
the accuracy.  
 
? Propose a method of optimization of SB using minimal classification threshold 
and training samples of the classifier. 
 
Then idea of further speeding up the analysis of the rare circuit events was proposed. This 
is achieved by evaluating the minimal classification threshold and training samples, 
which still ensures all of the tail points are covered. As the classification threshold and 
the training samples can decide how many samples are required to be simulated using 
HSPICE, the minimal value of these two parameters could further reduce the number of 
simulation. This means the simulation time could be further optimized to decrease the 
cost of the circuits.  
 
? Change the deviation of the Gaussian distribution to investigate the variation of 
the minimal classification threshold and the training sample. 
 
The deviation of the Gaussian distribution for each parameter was widened in the third 
stage of the project to investigate that what will happen on the value of minimal 
classification threshold and training samples of the classifier. As the decrease of the 
transistor scale may cause an increase of the process variation, this phenomenon can be 
considered as an increase in the deviation of the Gaussian distribution. Thus, analysis of 
47 
 
 
 
the influence of the widened deviation is required. The deviation of the parameters was 
firstly increased. Then the Statistical Blockade method and the idea of evaluating the 
minimal classification threshold and training samples are proposed. The minimal 
classification and training samples are estimated with respect to each parameter deviation. 
As a result, for the same deviation of parameter, the minimal classification threshold or 
minimal training sample will increase with the increased tail threshold. And if the 
deviation of the parameter increases, for the same tail threshold, the true threshold 
voltage of the tail points decreases. 
 
All of the work mentioned above is based on the method of Statistical Blockade. In this 
part, we have achieved all of the objectives, and addressed the questions we proposed. In 
practice, there are more questions we need to consider. In this project, for example, as the 
influence between the parameters is not noticeable, all of the parameter variations are 
considered to be independent to each other. If the parameters are not independent to each 
other, how will this influence the results we simulated?  
 
? Propose a low leakage design on SRAM cell with the dual threshold voltage. 
 
The final objective is to make a low leakage design on SRAM cells. This is accomplished 
by using the idea of dual threshold voltage transistors. Increasing the threshold voltage of 
some transistors could reduce the current through them. As analyzed previously, the 
leakage power for all working states of SRAM cell was reduced by the design with dual 
threshold voltage transistors. As the read delay, write delay, and the Static Noise Margin 
are also the most important factors of an SRAM cell, we also measured all of them in 
respect to the design with dual threshold voltage transistors. It can be found that not all 
configurations would influence the read time and write time by increasing of the 
threshold voltage. And the results provide an improvement of the SNM of the memory 
cell.  
 
As the dynamic power is still an important part of the total power dissipation, the analysis 
of dynamic power is required. In the future, the evaluation of dynamic power with the 
dual threshold voltage transistor will be carried out in order to investigate the effect of the 
dual threshold voltage design on dynamic power. By analyzing both the dynamic power 
and static power, a better assignment of the transistor and a better value of threshold 
voltage can be selected to make a design that can both reduce the leakage power and 
dynamic power.

7. Future work 
7.1 Statistical Blockade method 
In the analysis of the PVT variation on SRAM cells using Statistical Blockade, all the 
parameters are considered as independent with each other. This means if one parameter 
various, it would not influence the others. It is an ideal circumstance. Hence, there are 
two questions come out: Is there any relationship between the different parameter 
variations? And if those parameter variations are not independent, how this situation 
affects the analysis using Statistical Blockade? For example, if the threshold voltage of 
the NMOS is various follow a Gaussian distribution, there might be an influence on the 
threshold voltage of the PMOS.  
 
As we analyzed above, the relationship of all parameters are need to be concerned. Firstly, 
for each time, one parameter variation could be proposed, other parameters would kept 
with normal values. Secondly, two parameters could be varied with Gaussian 
distributions. Then, any difference of the results can be detected as we measured with one 
parameter changes and two parameter changes. If there is any difference, different 
parameters would affect each other. The measurement of how they affect each other also 
can be evaluated.  
 
7.2 Low-leakage design of SRAM cell with Dual    transistors  
In this project, three kinds of symmetric configurations of the high threshold voltage 
assignment were proposed. For all of the configurations, assume that the threshold 
voltage of each transistor can be considered as independent of each other, even if the 
channel doping is changed. This assumption seems to be safe, because the channels of the 
transistors are not too close to each other in the SRAM cell. 
 
However, it can be shown that if only one threshold voltage is used in the SRAM cell, the 
leakage power of the circuit also can be reduced. Hence, there should be some effects 
between the threshold voltages of the transistors which should be measured as well. 
 
The dynamic power is also one of the important parts of power consumption for one 
circuit. Therefore, how the dual threshold voltage design influences the dynamic power 
should be taken into consideration. The dynamic power for under each configuration 
should be measured as well. Then we can consider most of the factors of SRAM cell, 
which refers to read time, write time, Static Noise Margin, and both Dynamic Power and 
leakage power. In this way, a better design will be presented which has smaller dynamic 
power and leakage power consumption, larger Static Noise Margin, and also appropriate 
read time and write time at the same time.

8. Conclusion 
We have observed that circuits like SRAM are highly replicated, there may be millions of 
cells in one chip. Therefore, rare events of the cell will induce a not-so-rare event of the 
whole system. To detect the rare events of the cell efficiently is of growing concern. As 
the Standard Monte Carlo is too slow to simulate such a large amount of samples, a new 
problem of how to efficiently simulate the rare circuit events in such a highly replicated 
circuit is presented.  
 
It is recognized that the method of Statistical Blockade could solve this problem. The 
Statistical Blockade approach can do a very fast simulation of the critical circuit event. 
As the simulation using HSPICE is costly, the number of simulations needs to be reduced. 
This is achieved by efficiently filtering the tail points of the distribution using the 
classifier we built. We do not need to simulate all of the samples, only the tail points 
which are supposed to be the failure events are required to be simulated.  
 
The idea of minimizing the classification threshold and training samples was proposed to 
further speed up the simulation of the rare circuit events. Based on the idea of Statistical 
Blockade, all of the samples we need to simulate are the training samples of the classifier 
and the tail points we filtered. If we could reduce the number of those samples, the 
statistical analysis of the rare events would be faster. This was achieved by evaluating the 
minimal classification threshold and the training samples of the classifier. 
 
As we always want a low power design, we need to find a way to reduce the power 
consumption. Recently, leakage power is playing an important role in the total power 
dissipation. The design with dual threshold voltage transistors is proposed to reduce 
leakage power. And this design can improve the Static Noise Margin. The read time and 
write time of the memory cell can be controlled to not be overhead. 
 
As a conclusion, the Statistical Blockade is a basic approach to do an efficient simulation 
of rare circuit events. Based on this method, minimizing the classification threshold and 
training samples can be proposed to further speed up the statistical simulation of critical 
events. The dual threshold voltage design is an efficient approach to reduce leakage 
power.
