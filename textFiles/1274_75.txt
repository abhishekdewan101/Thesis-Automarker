Abstract 
There are two main purposes of this project. The first is to study the effect of behavioural 
changes (edge removal in this project) on the epidemic progress and network properties using 
network theory. We combined three epidemic models (SI, SIR and SIIR model) with four 
behaviour models. According to the sources and types of the awareness that leads to 
behavioural changes, the four behaviour models are global-disease based, global-belief based, 
local disease-based and local-belief based. We tested all the combination possibilities on 
different network structures by varying parameters of epidemic control strategies on our 
designed simulation. In order to reduce the bias, each single experiment has been run 150 
times on theoretical networks and 300 times on real world networks. 
The second purpose of this project is to design epidemic control strategy related to 
behavioural changes. We choose to view the effect of behavioural changes as edge removal in 
this project, although it could have other effects like reduced infection rate. Different from 
previous works, our strategies mainly focused on using local information to find critical edges 
for each node since the behavioural change is on the individual level. We tested various 
methods to find critical edges including using similarity, high degree, clustering coefficient, 
and local community detection algorithms. We compared these strategies with both the global 
strategies that need the whole network information to find critical edges and the local strategy 
that randomly removes edges to infected individuals. 
Executive summary: 
? I design a behaviour-disease model and create a simulation for doing experiments on it, 
see page 17-23. 
? I design and implement various new local edge removal strategies based on existing 
network algorithms, see page 23-29. 
? The research carried out and reported in this thesis consists of a comparison and 
evaluation of five local edge removal strategies and three control strategies, leading to 
following discoveries: 
? Some local community detect algorithm could be used reversely to find 
intercommunity edges only using each node’s local information in network with 
community structure. 
? The higher the community strength, the easier to find intercommunity edges using 
local algorithm 
? Local edge removal strategies needs fewer network information and is also epidemic 
information independent, which is more feasible and realistic since epidemic and 
network information is too dynamic to know in real life. 
? “Local Modularity strategy” modified from Clauset’s local community detection 
algorithm played as well as global edge betweenness algorithm in finding 
intercommunity edges and also faster in large network.  
? Reducing contact with people in other community was more effective than only 
reducing contact with infected people in own community with regard to control 
disease in global view, because communities can be separated. 
? Local strategy applied to each node during epidemic process could be as effective as 
being applied before epidemic start if each node removes enough percentage of edges. 
It also removes fewer edges totally. 
? If there is asymptomatic infectious state, increasing awareness spread rate is in a 
limited help because the awareness spread path might not be same as disease spread 
path.

Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                        1 
1 Introduction 
The most common infectious disease in human is usually transmitted by air during close 
proximity interactions. During the outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, not only the 
disease itself but also public's sustained and widely influenced reaction has been studied. The 
phenomenon that most people wear face masks and stay away with public places mainly result 
from individual's fear of the high death rate through the whole world. It reminds us again how 
individual's behavioural change can make such a huge difference to the society. Thus 
individual's behavioural change again arise people's wide awareness to study how it can be 
linked to disease control since McNeil’s first related study in 1976. Many researchers have tried 
to quantify and capture such behavioural changes in a systematic study both using 
mathematical method and simulation method. Our study is based on doing experiment on 
simulation, so we will not provide mathematical analysis such as mean-field. We focus on the 
influenza-like disease spreading by close proximity interactions, so all epidemic models, 
behavioural models and networks are related to this kind of disease. In this section, we will first 
describe the objectives of the project and then will give the structure of this dissertation. 
 
1.1 Aims and objectives  
The aim of our project is to study how human behavioural changes can affect epidemic spread 
and what kind of strategy related to behavioural changes can effectively stop disease spreading. 
To achieve this aim, my project has the following objectives:  
? Build a model combining behavioural changes and disease spreading. 
? Build a simulation of the model. 
? Design and test the performance of various strategies related to behavioural changes on 
simulation by varying different parameters. 
? Evaluate the performance of various strategies 
 
Our experiments are conducted for addressing following research questions: 
a) How behavioural changes will affect the epidemic size, duration and peak? 
b) How behavioural changes will affect the network structure? 
c) Whether it is possible for individual making behavioural change based on local 
information? 
d) How network structure and properties will affect disease spread and strategy performance? 
e) How awareness spread can affect the epidemic results? 
 
 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks

1.2 Structure 
This dissertation consists of 5 main chapters. Firstly, in “Background” section, we review the 
basic concept of epidemic models and the categories of behaviour models. Then various 
methods of integrating behavioural changes in epidemic models are shown. Next epidemic 
related networks are introduced along with the measurement methods of epidemic and network 
properties. By the end of background, related existing disease control strategies will be shown 
and be analysed to see where can be improved and what can be used in this project. Secondly, 
the “Methods” section explains how our simulation is developed and how our experiments are 
conducted. Next comes the “Results and analysis” section, where we will give a reasonable 
analysis according to experiments results. In fourth section, we summarize our key experiment 
findings and discuss its relationship to current epidemic and behaviour studies. An evaluation 
of this project is also explained in this section to determine whether objectives have been met. 
Finally, future work is discussed related to further improvements and further extensions that 
could be carried out based on our existing findings. 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      3 
2 Background 
2.1 Network 
In this project network is used to model the structure of population where epidemic spreading 
on. The population is represented by a network where a node stands for an individual, and an 
edge between two nodes means that the two individuals interact in a way allowing disease 
transmission. The node degree is the number of the contacts of the individual. In network 
theory, there are various kinds of networks which differ in network properties (such as degree 
distribution). The networks related to epidemic study can be classified into theoretical networks, 
real networks and empirical networks depending on how networks are constructed [Matt and 
Ken 2005]. We will review these networks and explain how these networks can be used in our 
study. Also we will review how the network properties can affect epidemic spreading, which is 
important in design our disease control strategy. 
2.1.1 Real networks 
It is hard to find a real network related for a specific disease. Because having knowledge of 
every individual and relationship leading to infection is a time consuming and complex task. 
Although people use three main techniques to gather network information: infection tracing, 
complete contract tracing and diary-based studies. All these three techniques have 
disadvantages. The infection tracing can only record the interaction leading to disease 
transmission while contact tracing and diary-based studies rely entirely on individual providing 
correct and complete data [Matt and Ken 2005]. Unless we can find an existing dataset related 
to our project, it is less possible to use a real network in our project since we have no time and 
ability to gather such huge data ourselves. 
2.1.2 Simulated networks 
A simulated network is built by following the observed social characteristics. It is like creating 
a plausible topology. The properties of a network (like the degree distribution) can be set 
according to the real social characteristics. The process of disease transmitting in society can be 
modelled in such network to study the epidemic dynamics.  
Some researchers have tried to simulate an airborne disease outbreak. [Matt and Ken 2005] 
reviewed that in order to study the spread of smallpox, a network with 2000 individuals was 
generated with a given age distribution and household size that agree with the value for the 
United States Census 2000. Several acting rules are required among the networks such as each 
community had connections with four other communities, households had 1 to 7 people per 
family, person-to-person transmission probabilities varies according to different places and so 
on. However, it is hard to proof that such simulation can fully represent the real situation of 
disease spreading in community. The unknown structure of network also help less in analysing 
what element of network is important in the epidemic dynamics. 
This method is worth trying if a suitable dataset about the daily social communication of a 
city or town is available. It needs to know how people are connected and how they 
communicate each other. There are some existing datasets provided online by researchers in 
this area. But most of the datasets are small like a dataset of a club. There rarely has a dataset 
with a relationship of a town or a city. The only possible dataset about social communities are 
from virtual web communities such as “Facebook” which may not be as same network 
structure as the one within real population. So it is hard to find convincing datasets. 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      4 
2.1.3 Idealized networks or theoretical networks 
Since the real networks and simulated networks both need huge effort to obtain large scale 
and reliable data on real population. Many idealized networks have been constructed to 
theoretically study networks. These networks are based on the known features of 
real-transmission networks (like how individuals are distributed and how they are connected) 
but are simplified a lot to catch the key point that affecting the epidemic dynamic mostly. 
Here we introduce several idealized networks can be possible used in epidemic study. 
2.1.3.1 Random network 
In random network, each individual are randomly connected to mixed number of other 
individuals and the network has no clustering. Each individual has similar degree just like the 
random-mixing model. The disease spread rate is reduced in this model compared with 
random-mixing model because an infected individual reduces its neighbours' susceptible 
contacts and continues infects more susceptible neighbours to let susceptible status around it 
less and less. In random-mixing model, the number of susceptible around an individual is 
according to the whole population not the local environment, so random network limits the rate 
of disease spread locally[Matt and Ken 2005]. 
Instead of randomly choosing fixed number of contacts for each individual, the network can 
also be formed by connecting any two nodes with probability p. This network has a Poisson 
degree distribution and the growth rate in it is still reduced. Therefore, the epidemic dynamic in 
random network are same as an SIR epidemic in a randomly mixed population [Matt and Ken 
2005]. 
2.1.3.2 Lattices 
In lattices, individuals are regularly spaced on a grid (usually two dimensions) and each 
individual is connected to its contacts. The characteristic of this network is that contacts are all 
localized in space and the infection tends to spread locally because of clustering. Lattice models 
also show a reduction in early growth rate of the disease compared with random-mixing model. 
Growth rate are reduced even more rapidly than in the random networks, which is because the 
clustering makes fast saturation of the local environment [Matt and Ken 2005]. Lattice also 
shows a wave-like spread of infection. Both epidemic sizes and epidemic durations obey a 
power-law, which helps explain some observed behaviour of infection. 
2.1.3.3 Small-world networks 
In lattices, two random selected individuals have long path between them while in small world 
networks, there are some long-range edges connecting the individuals that are not neighbours. 
So small-world networks show the characteristic of both clustering and global connectivity 
[Watts and Strogatz 1998]. It is studied that a few long-range edges can significantly speed the 
population-level spread of infection. In this kind of network, the effects of both clustering of 
connection and long-range transmission of disease have been observed important in disease 
spread. Human social networks are thought to be small worlds [Matt and Ken 2005], thus this 
structure is important in modelling disease spreading in human society. Since features of 
small-world networks also present in social mixing network, it is suitable to do experiment on 
small-world networks to find disease control strategies. For example, it is said that the 
clustering phenomenon makes disease spread locally while the short long-range edges can 
enable rapid spread disease to reach wider area outside local regions [Matt and Ken 2005]. 
Therefore it is a good idea to consider what kind of behaviour changes can reduce the 
long-rang edges so that disease can be kept in small regions. 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      5 
2.1.3.4 Spatial networks 
Individuals are positioned within a given area and two individuals are connected with a specific 
probability decided by a connection kernel which usually decays with distance to make 
connection locally. Spatial network can be configured to generate lattices or small-world 
networks. The degree distribution of spatial networks is usually Poisson. 
2.1.3.5 Scale-free networks 
Scale-free networks [Barabási and Albert 1999] are used to study those highly connected 
individuals. The degree distribution in scale-free network is power-law, which means that some 
node have extreme large number of contacts compared with average nodes. The new joined 
individual tends to connect with those highly connected individuals, which is familiar with the 
phenomenon that individual wants to be friends with the most popular people. In this kind of 
network, the highly connected individuals play a vital role in the spread and maintenance of 
infection, where infection is concentrated among these highest degree individuals [Matt and 
Ken 2005]. Therefore, it seems valuable to study how to control the disease spread by 
controlling these highly connected individuals, which has been tried in our project. 
2.1.3.6 Exponential random graph models 
Exponential random graph models provide a method to construct network with a given set of 
properties. Since the probability of connection between two nodes is independent, the 
constructor can decide how exactly any two nodes are connected without breaking the network 
properties. [Matt and Ken 2005] reviewed that Markov Chain Monte Carlo can be used to 
create plausible networks only requiring knowing the network structure. Therefore, once the 
information of the social contact network structure where the influenza spreads on is known, a 
simulated network can be created using this method.

and scale-free (bottom row). The bottom right-hand graph shows the power-law degree distribution of 
scale-free network. Source from [Matt and Ken 2005] 
In summary, as shown in Figure 1, different network types have different network properties 
and suit for different study emphases. The random network have short path length but low 
clustering while the lattices have high clustering but long path length. Small-world networks 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      6 
have clustering and short path length while scale free network particularly have some highly 
connected nodes. Therefore, lattices are useful to study how clustering stop disease spread and 
small world can be used to study whether reducing long-range edges (same as increase path 
length) can help control disease spread. When we want to control disease spread through highly 
connected individuals, studying scale-free network should be a better choice. 
2.1.4 Social contact networks 
Based on the previous review, we have known that many properties of network structure can 
affect the disease spreading, such as degree distribution, level of clustering, path length and so 
on. Thus disease show different dynamics in different theoretical networks such as random 
network, small-world network, lattices and scale-free networks. Since we tend to study flu like 
diseases, we may focus on the social contact networks where the influenza spreads on. In this 
section, we are going to introduce some networks used in previous papers to study 
influenza-like disease spreading. For the theoretical network, some researchers think scale-free 
network can stand for the contact network because it is consistent with the fact that some people 
or groups are highly contacted in real life. [Salathé and Jones 2010] studied how to control 
disease in networks with community structure. In their paper, they believe that social networks 
show significant community structure, with high clustering and modular. The structure of 
social contact network can also be revealed from real investigated data. After gathering the data 
of close proximity interaction in a high school, [Salathé et al. 2010] found that the contact 
network was a high-density network with typical small-world properties and a homogeneous 
distribution of both interaction time and interaction partners among subjects. In [Lagorio et al. 
2011], they use one homogeneous network and one heterogeneous network to represent the 
social network respectively. For the homogeneous network, they use Erdös-Rényi networks 
with Poissonian degree distribution: 
? ? =
??<?><?>?
? 
 . 
For the heterogeneous network, they use finite sale-free networks with degree distribution: 
? ? =
??? ???  ?
?
?
 
???  ?
?
1
? 
,  
where K is the degree cut-off. However, it is not clear that whether the real world contact 
network is scale-free or small-world or not. Since the real world contact network may be quit 
complicated and contain all of those properties, only one theoretical network not be able to 
represent it. 
Alternatively, researchers will create an empirical social contact network using census data, 
traffic data, migration data or demographic data (shown in section 4.2). For example, an urban 
contact network model was built based on demographic information for the city of Vancouver, 
British Columbia [Meyers et al. 2005]. Another method of building empirical networks was 
shown in [Salathé and Jones 2010]. The social network website “Facebook” data was used to 
extract sub-graphs that individuals, who have friendships, live in the same dormitory residence, 
study in same class and have other actions that are likely to transmit an infection, will have 
many edges connecting each others. They use this assumption to construct several contact 
networks. [Salathé et al. 2010] also use wireless sensor network technology to obtain 
high-resolution data of close proximity interactions during a typical day at an American high 
school and thus construct a simulated network with weighted edges for an influenza-like 
disease. The problem is the accuracy of these kinds of empirical network is not known. 
Whether the data collected is convincing enough still need further verification.  
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      7 
Besides, [Bansal et al. 2007] have studied several empirical contact networks based on the real 
contact networks and find that the empirical human contact networks created in many research 
papers fit an exponential degree distribution. In the appendix of [Bansal et al. 2007], the 
algorithm of creating such an exponential degree network is provided. It first generates an 
uncorrelated random network and then rewires the edges to show an exponential degree 
distribution. This is also a good choice despite those theoretical networks.  
2.1.5 Measure properties of network 
Individual's behavioural changes often lead to the changes in the properties of network. These 
changes usually play a vital role in controlling disease and our strategy also focus on 
controlling disease by changing these properties. Therefore, measuring these properties help us 
analyse and should be carried out frequently through the whole experiment. 
2.1.5.1 Degree distribution 
The probability P(k) defines a node chosen at random will have degree k. The P(k) distribution 
for all the nodes shows the degree distribution of the network. Degree distribution is an 
important way of measuring how network structure has been changed by individuals' 
behavioural changes. The average degree k of an undirected graph is defined as the number of 
all edges divided by the number of all nodes times two: 
? =  ?? ? =
2?
?
?
 
The degree distribution is critical in measuring the heterogeneity of the network that related to 
individuals' potential to become infected and causing infection. The higher the degree a node 
has, the more likely it will be infected and infect others. The moments of the degree distribution 
can help calculating the degree distribution variance and n th moment of P(k) is defined as 
[Leon et al. 2011]: 
< ?? >=  ???(?)
?
  . 
For the correlated network in our simulation, the probability ?(?? |?) of a node with degree k 
is dependent on the degree k' of its neighbours. Then the average of k' for all nodes with degree 
k can be calculated as [Leon et al. 2011]: 
??? =  ?
?
? ?
? ??  ?   . 
knn  is used to show the relationship between the degree of the node and its neighbours' degrees. 
2.1.5.2 Distance 
In a network, the distance between two nodes is the shortest path between them. The average 
distance < d > of all pairs of nodes can be defined as mean of the distances between all nodes 
[Leon et al. 2011]: 
< ? >=
1
?(? + 1)
 ??,?
?≠?
  , 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      8 
where N is the number of nodes in the network and diameter of the network is max(di,j). 
The distance always shows how many steps are needed to spread disease from one node to 
another. The effect of small-world phenomenon is because of short average distance between 
all nodes which makes disease spread much more rapidly. So distance study has clear effect in 
controlling disease. 
Shortest distance through a network also helps quantify the node betweenness centrality which 
is defined as the proportion of shortest path that pass through a single node [Leon et al. 2011]: 
?? =
#???????? ???? ??????? ?
?(? ? 1)
  , 
where N is the number of nodes in the network. Edge betweenness centrality is defined 
similarly, which is the proportion of shortest path that pass through a single edge. It is widely 
known that central nodes are likely to be infected early and most of disease will spread through 
betweenness node. Thus controlling nodes with high betweenness plays an important role in 
disease control [Salathé and Jones 2010]. 
2.1.5.3 Clustering 
The clustering coefficient ? represents the local density of a graph. It is defined as the 
probability that two neighbours of a node are also connected with each other and can be 
calculated as [Leon et al. 2011]: 
?? =
3 ? # ?? ????????? ?? ??? ???????
# ?? ????????? ???????
  . 
The clustering coefficient for each node in undirected graph can be calculated as: 
?? =
2|??? |
??(?? ? 1)
  , 
where ki  is the number of neighbours of node i, ejk  defines all edges among neighbours of 
node i. Clustering always be considered important in disease spread for the rapid local 
depletion of susceptible individuals[Leon et al. 2011]. 
2.1.5.4 Community 
The community is defined as each sub-graph having a high density of edges within it and lower 
density of edges between sub-graphs (see Figure 2). Community structure has been detected in 
studies of real world social networks representing the groups of people with highly similar 
demographics [Kitchovitch and Liò 2011]. Girvan and Newman [Girvan and Newman 2002] 
first introduce a community detection algorithm of “edge betweenness” and show that 
identifying community structure can help split the social and biological networks into 
meaningful clusters. [Salathé and Jones 2010] find that immunization interventions that change 
the structure of the contact network targeted in network with strong community structure are 
much more effective.

2.2 Epidemic model  
The spread of disease is defined by an epidemic model. There have been a lot of epidemic 
models but most of them follow a similar pattern. Stemming from the first SIR model, most of 
the epidemic models contain several epidemic states (such as S, I, R states in SIR model) 
representing whether individual is infected or not. There are rates for people transferring from 
one state to another. The main difference between these models is that different models claim 
different numbers and names of state and define different methods to transfer node from one 
state to another. The most widely studied epidemic model is the SIR 
(susceptible-infected-recovered) model [Kermack and McKendrick 1927], which is considered 
as the foundation of almost all other disease models. 
The epidemic models can be divided into deterministic and stochastic types. In deterministic 
model, the model is formulated by differential equations to express the changes of epidemic 
process with respect to time. The changes can be calculated using information of previous 
step. So the whole epidemic process is deterministic by inputting the initial status. A 
stochastic model contains random variable, which is used to estimate probability distribution 
of potential results.  
2.2.1 Deterministic differential equation model 
Below we first introduce the basic deterministic SIR model. As shown in Figure 3, individual is 
in susceptible state (S) at first. Once being infected, individual transfers to infective state (I). At 
last it becomes removed (R) which means recover from the disease and immune or dead. 
Infected individuals infect all states contacted with them at rate ? per unit time while ? means 
average recover rate per unit time. This can be described by the following coupled non-linear 
differential equations [Bailey 1975]: 
??
??
= ????,
??
??
= ??? ? ??,
??
??
= ??  , 
where s, i, r are the fraction of the population in each states and s + i + r = 1. The SIR model suit 
for infectious disease that confers lifelong immunity such as influenza, which is also our project 
focuses on. However, deterministic equation based model is more appropriate for representing 
expected results under mean-field approximation in mathematical study.

et al. 2010]) 
2.2.2 Stochastic agent-based model 
The above differential equation model assumes homogeneity and perfect mixing within 
compartments, which means the population mixes at random and each individual has same 
contacts per unit time and has same infect and recover rates. However in real life it is less 
possible. Thus agent-based mode is needed to capture heterogeneity among individuals and in 
network topology. In the agent-based model, each individual is separately represented and must 
be in different epidemic states discussed in deterministic model. Instead of using equation, each 
individual transmits between epidemic states by considering its neighbours’ states in a specific 
probability. 
Since our project focuses on individual’s behavioural changes, the stochastic agent-based 
model is more suitable to study the changes in individual level and it can easily be run on 
different network topologies (e.g. random, scale-free etc.) 
2.2.3 Measurement of epidemic 
For the deterministic equation based model, the basic reproduction number denoted by R0 is 
used to determine whether an epidemic occurs or die out, which is defined as the average 
number of secondary infections from a single infective individual in a fully susceptible 
population [Diekmann et al.1990]. The infective individual makes ?N contact per time step 
leading to new infections with duration of 1/?. So the basic reproduction number can be 
calculated by  
?0 =
??
?
 , 
If R0 > 1, the infection die out, otherwise there will be an epidemic in the population. 
For the stochastic agent-based model, we can get the number of individuals in each epidemic 
state each time step. So we can calculate the ratio of infectious cases in each time step, the total 
infected cases at all (epidemic size), the highest infection rate and the epidemic duration as a 
measurement of epidemic. 
2.3 Behaviour models 
In the previous section, we have discussed epidemic models. Now in this section we will 
introduce different behaviour models and then we try to find a combination model of the SIR 
model talked above and the behaviour models. Our review in this section is based on the idea in 
[Funk et al. 2010]. There are various ways to model the behaviour change over time. [Funk et 
al. 2010] gave a classification of behaviour-disease model based on the causes and 
consequences of behavioural change. They focus on conceptual difference in the process to 
 S  I  R

Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      11 
combine behaviour element into disease model. In the following parts, we first discuss the 
classification of causes of behavioural changes and then give the summary of consequences of 
behavioural changes along with the integration of behaviour-disease model. 
2.3.1 Cause of behavioural changes  
With regard to the cause of behavioural changes,[Funk et al. 2010] classified all behaviour 
models based on the source and type of information that result in people's behavioural changes. 
The source of information can be global and local. If individuals base their behavioural choices 
on publicly information such as newspaper, TV news and other media, the source is global. 
Otherwise, they assume that the information is local and taken from social or spatial 
neighbourhood only. The global information is known useful for arising cluster to against 
disease spread (like the clustered occurrence of beliefs about vaccines) while local information 
is recognized to completely stop a disease from spreading in some circumstance.[Funk et al. 
2009][Funk et al. 2010] The types of information can be separated into objective and subjective. 
If the information is related to disease prevalence, this kind of information is prevalence-based 
and subjective. Otherwise it is belief-based and has nothing to do with the disease prevalence 
[Funk et al. 2010]. For example, the decision about childhood vaccines is belonged to 
belief-based since the disease may not actually breaks out. 
2.3.2 Effect of behavioural changes 
[Funk et al. 2010] review three possible effects of behavioural change to disease spreading: 
disease state in epidemic model (such as S, I, R in SIR model), the infection or recovery rate 
and the contact network structure where the disease spread. The first type effect is mainly used 
in study how the decision to vaccinate affects the disease dynamics, because the change in state 
is assumed as a result of accepting vaccination. Since our project focuses more on the 
behavioural change rather than accepting vaccination, we mainly review the last two types of 
behavioural change which stand for the effect of people reducing contacts with neighbours 
when they view or believe the present of disease. With respect to the effect of model parameters 
like infection or recovery rate, it is mainly because people seek some treatment and have 
protective actions like wear face mask. For the effect of the network structure, it is always a 
consequence of people cutting edge of possible contagion by staying at home or avoiding 
contact with infected people. In order to distinguish with the effect of parameters change, many 
researchers let the individual forms a new edge after cutting one so that the structure can have a 
significant change. In the following part, we will review how these two effects have been 
integrated into epidemic models and try to find a way to form our own behaviour-disease model. 
We also review what kind behaviour related parameters have been created in models and how 
researchers studied them. 
2.3.2.1 Regard behavioural change as change of parameter: Change of edges 
Many researchers model the behavioural change as a spread of awareness. The awareness can 
be fear or the belief of presence of the disease. Such awareness may lead people hiding, 
isolating themselves to reduce contact with neighbours in network or flee to stay away from 
where the disease exists. Whether people accept such awareness is based on a possibility just 
like the idea that people is infected based on transmission probability. Therefore behavioural 
parameters can be integrated into epidemic model using the way of disease spreading. [Epstein 
et al. 2008][Funk et al. 2009][Funk et al. 2010]

Not get sick ?(1-?) (1-?)(1-?) 
Figure 5: Transmission Probabilities from [Epstein et al. 2008] 
[Epstein et al. 2008] extends the basic SIR model to seven states shown in Figure 4. Each 
individual can be infected by disease (pathogen, see Figure 5) or awareness (fear, see Figure 5) 
and recovered from disease or fear. Let ? denote the awareness transmission rate and ? denote 
the disease transmission rate. Figure 5 shows the possibilities of individual in S state becoming 
state IF , IP , IPF  or remaining state S when he contacts an individual in state IPF . If ? is set to 0, 
a purely SIR model of disease is shown and if ? is set to 0, a SIR model of awareness is got. 
Both the model will show a declining susceptible S-curve and an increasing disease infection 
S-curve. [Epstein et al. 2008] define two possible behavioural changed when individual is 
infected by awareness. The first one is that they hide themselves by cutting all edges around 
them in network for a specified time steps. The second response is that they move themselves to 
a new location in the network within specified distances which is considered as flee. In such a 
model, they need to study the effects of the parameters in the disease dynamics including the 
size of network, the degree distribution, movement and contact radii, the transmission rates of 
the disease and awareness, the duration of sickness, the distance fled and the duration of 
self-isolation.  
They use experimental simulation to study the first behaviour and the second behaviour 
separately and also study the case combining these two behaviours. In their conclusion, the 
percentage of fled people has significant influence to the speed and size of disease. They find 
that even a small amount of flight dramatically increases the number of infected people and 
spreads the disease to further areas. However self-isolation does have effective reduce of the 
total number of infected people. This means that our project may not consider transferring 
people as a way to stop disease but do take individual's self-isolation into consideration. 
2.3.2.2 Regard behavioural change as change of parameter: Infection rate 
[Funk et al. 2009][Funk et al. 2010] similarly consider the awareness of disease spreads 
independently even in a different network from where disease spreads. But they consider the 
awareness fading parameter in the model which makes the model more practical. The 
behavioural changes are denoted as the changes in infection rate. 
 
 
S: Susceptible to pathogen and fear 
IF: Infected with fear only 
IP : Infected with pathogen only 
IPF : Infected with pathogen and fear

R: Recovered from pathogen and immune to fear

Figure 7: Infection rates from [Funk et al. 2010] 
[Funk et al. 2009][Funk et al. 2010] define six states shown in Figure 6 to denote whether 
individual is aware or unaware. They assume the behavioural changes happen both in 
susceptible individuals and infected individuals. They denote the infection rate from unaware 
person to unaware person as ?. If the infected individual takes some action to prevent the 
disease spreading, the reduction in infectivity is shown by a factor 0 < ?s< 1 multiple infection 
rate ?. If the susceptible individuals are aware of the disease, they will reduce contact or take 
medication which reduces their infectiveness. Such reduce is denoted as a reduction factor 0 < 
?I< 1 Thus the four resulted infection rate is shown in Figure 7. They also define a rate of 
infected individual becoming aware. The recovery rate is different between aware and unaware 
people. All these parameters help [Funk et al. 2009][Funk et al. 2010] find that reduced 
infectivity, shorter duration of infection of those aware and infected, reduced susceptibility of 
aware susceptible can inhibit the spread of disease. This influence is more effective if the 
network of awareness overlaps with the network of disease transmission. Therefore our project 
can try these effective methods in our models.  
[Kiss et al. 2009] uses similar model but relates the awareness fading to the disease prevalence. 
Both the time and the decrease of disease prevalence will lead to awareness fade more quickly. 
They also get the conclusion that if individual have high awareness and seek treatment earlier, 
the disease prevalence will be reduced. 
2.3.2.3 Regard behavioural changes as changes of network structure 
Many researchers have found that the network structure can affect the disease spreading. 
[Huang and Li 2007][Salathé and Jones 2010] found that scale-free networks with strong 
community structure are helpful for reducing the disease spreading. Infection in large degree 
nodes can result in a larger-scale epidemic spreading in strong community structure but the 
prevalence scale is also more predictable in strong community structure. [Shaw and Schwartz 
2008] design a model on an adaptive network. Based on susceptible-infective- 
recovered-susceptible (SIRS) epidemic model, if there is an edge connecting non-infected node 
to infected node, that non-infected node will cut the edge and add a new edge to another 
randomly selected non-infected node. They found that before rewiring all nodes show 
Poissonian degree distribution. But after rewiring, infected nodes tend to have low degrees and 
non-infected nodes have larger degrees since non-infected nodes tend to rewire to non-infected 
nodes. This also leads to the balance of the epidemic and disease-free states. Another worth 
learning parameter is the distance from nearest infective node. As shown in Figure 8(a), 
rewiring significantly decrease the number of nodes connected to an infected node compared to 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      14 
un-rewired model. Figure 8(b) shows that the distribution of distance decays in the same way in 
an adaptive network and random network except that adaptive network has some nodes totally 
disconnected with the infected nodes.

dashed gray line: no rewiring (b) Black line: rewired case; and gray line: distribution for random 
graphs. Source from [Shaw and Schwartz 2008] 
 
All these findings remind us that studying network structure is important in our project. It is 
worth study whether such adaptive network can be relates to a community structure since the 
infected node and non-infected nodes tend to form a community respectively. Also we can 
integrate parameter changes talked in above section into this adaptive network since node may 
show different rewire behaviour according to its local situation. 
In summary, by reviewing these behaviour models we find that there are two types of 
behavioural changes: change the parameters in epidemic model or change the network structure. 
When modelling the behaviour spreading, most papers regard behaviour spread as a disease 
spread so that each individual accept a new behaviour based on a specific probability. Our 
project tends to study how the effect of removing edges which result from behavioural 
changes and lead to changes of network structure can affect epidemic process and design a 
strategy related to this kind of change to control epidemic. 
2.4 Some disease control strategies in existing studies 
In this section, we are going to review some strategies that can effectively control the spread of 
disease. These strategies may not necessarily related to behavioural changes but these strategies 
can give us some intuition about what kind of properties can be considered in controlling 
disease. Since there has few existing strategies about behavioural changes, we find some 
strategies related to immunization. The immunization strategies are aimed at finding key node 
and let that node immunization while our behavioural changes strategies can focus on finding 
key edges or the edges of key nodes and cut or rewire those edges. The immunization and 
behavioural changes strategies both have the idea of finding key features of network. We can 
learn what kind of feature is important and how to find it from those exiting immunization 
strategies so that we can apply them in our strategies. That is why we will introduce some 
immunization strategies below.  
2.4.1 Finding nodes connecting multiple communities 
In order to keep the infection of disease in one community only, the nodes connecting multiple 
communities show great role in controlling disease spread. One strategy of controlling disease 
spread is to immunize the individuals connecting multiple communities (so-called community

bridge)[Salathé and Jones 2010]. Despite of finding these nodes with betweenness centrality as 
community bridges, [Salathé and Jones 2010] design a community bridge finder (CBF) 
algorithm without the need to know the complete network structure. The general idea of CBF is 
to pick a random node n and follow a random path to arrive another node n+1. One step each 
time and Check if there is connection between node n and those visited nodes in previous steps. 
If there is no connection except the one between n and n+1, n is the potential community bridge. 
Then check whether the neighbours of node n+1 connect any visited nodes. If there is no 
connection, then the node n is the community bridge. Otherwise keep following random path 
and check again. The empirical and computationally generated networks tests shows CBF 
algorithm performed as well as traditional deterministic algorithm calculation shortest path to 
find betweenness central nodes. The CBF algorithm makes improvement because it does not 
need to know the whole global network structure which is often known little in real human 
contact process compared with traditional deterministic algorithm. But the efficiency of CBF is 
lower than traditional deterministic algorithm. So there still has some space to improve. 
2.4.2 Finding critical edges in network 
Paper [Marcelino and Kaiser 2009, 2012] have tested several edge removal strategies on real 
global flight network and found that cancelling fewer flights could result in both a larger 
slowdown of spreading and a smaller number of infected individuals compared to hub 
removal strategies. Removing critical edges means only fewer flight might be cancelled and 
fewer passengers are affected in contrast to the hub removal strategies which need to shut 
down the whole hub airports. They observed that removing the highest betweenness edges 
was the best at predicting critical edges that carried the most traffic loads leading to a large 
reduction in epidemic size. They also found that removing the edges ranked by structural 
Jaccard coefficient can delay the peak of epidemic mostly. They showed the critical role of 
highly ranked connections for the transmission of disease and demonstrated that the 
mechanism behind the good performance of these edge removal strategies display a 
community structure. The strategies tested are all global strategies which rank edges by using 
the whole network information while our project also concentrate on these highly ranked 
edges but only using local information to find them. 
2.4.3 Intermittent social distancing strategy in [Valdez et al. 2010] 
This strategy aims at SIR model in an adaptive network. Each time step an infected individual 
tries to spread the disease to a susceptible neighbour with probability ?. If it fails, the 
susceptible will cut the edge with the infected individual with a probability ? for a period t. 
After that period the two nodes will be reconnected. This process repeats each time step until 
infected node transfer to R state. This strategy only requires each node using their local 
information. It was proofed to be useful (using percolation theory) in disease control for 
non-highly heterogeneous network by choosing a specific edge cut probability ?. In the real 
network test, this strategy still can stop some epidemic spreading for non-virulent disease. The 
main idea of this strategy is to create a susceptible cluster by cutting edges. Reconnection of 
removed edges make this strategy has less economic cost but still workable. 
2.4.4 Rewire edge strategy in [Lagorio et al. 2011] 
There are two strategies introduced in paper [Lagorio et al. 2011] according to whether 
susceptible nodes have information about the state of their neighbours. In strategy A, 
susceptible nodes have no state information of their neighbours until they have physical contact. 
At each time step, each infected node try to transmit the disease to its neighbours with some 
probability. If it failed, its susceptible neighbour will cut the edge between them and rewire to 
connect another randomly chosen susceptible node with probability w. In strategy B, each node 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      16 
knows the state of its neighbours. Thus each susceptible node attached to an infected node will 
cut the edge between them and rewire to connect another randomly chosen susceptible node 
with probability w before physical contact. After proof using analytical approach and 
numerical simulation, they find that by increasing the rewiring probability w, the size of the 
epidemics can be reduced and the propagation can be stopped eventually with high rewiring 
probability w. Strategy A will not effective when the infection probability is high enough for 
physical contact happened earlier than rewiring. But strategy B always performs well both in 
homogeneous networks and finite heterogeneous networks. Since the rewiring probability is 
higher in scale free networks, they improve strategy B to rewire according to the degree of the 
infected nodes, which isolates the super-spreaders in scale-free networks. Although both 
strategies are shown workable in control epidemic spread. These strategies are not fully 
consistent with real social life. Because if node rewires randomly, the possibility that it rewires 
back when its previous neighbour is recovered is higher than rewiring to other unknown nodes. 
But they are considered equal in both strategies. 
In summary, most strategies are based on two general ideas: finding key nodes or decide 
which edges to cut. Key nodes always have great roles in scale-free network or networks with 
community structures. These nodes have high degree or play a bridge role. Successfully 
finding them and do something with them always lead to effective control in disease 
spreading. When it comes to cut edges, most strategies will choose to cut edges with infected 
nodes and some may build new edges to susceptible nodes. These methods have been 
confirmed to be useful. But few of them think of cutting edges that connect further area 
(another community) to prevent disease spreading further, which our project focus on. 
Reducing these long range edges results in high level of clustering which may tend to keep 
infection in local area. Additionally, study in [Epstein et al. 2008] shows that totally moving 
susceptible nodes to another uninfected area may not be a suitable strategy since even a small 
amount of flight can dramatically increases the number of infected people and spreads the 
disease to further areas. This means that when designing rewire strategy, it is important to 
carefully control the number of edges that can be cut.

3 Methods  
In this section, we are going to explain the methods of our experiments in detail. Our 
experiments have three main components: networks, epidemic models and edge removal 
strategies. Networks define where the disease spread while epidemic models determine how 
disease will spread. The edge removal strategies can be applied in different time step? of 
epidemic process to form our four main experiment models. Firstly, we are going to summarize 
experiment models. Then the detail of networks used and epidemic models will be discussed in 
section 3.2 and 3.3 respectively. Finally, algorithms of local edge removal strategies and 
disease control strategies will be described in section 3.4 and the whole simulation will be 
introduced in section 3.5. 
3.1 Experiment design 
According to source and type of behaviour (see section 2.3), the whole experiments can be 
separated into four parts (shown in table 1): strategies applied before disease start, strategies 
applied by infected nodes, strategies applied by all nodes in different steps and strategies 
applied by aware nodes. These four kinds of experiments are shown in Table 1 and a summary 
of all experiment parameters are shown in Table 2.

3.1.1 Experiment one: global-belief-based 
This experiment can be viewed as whole population become aware of disease before disease 
actually starts spreading, which means that all nodes in network will apply edge removal 
strategies at beginning (regard as behavioural changes influenced by publicly available 
information). When each node applies strategy, there is a remove fraction limiting how many 
edges can be removed totally. Each strategy will find one candidate edge to remove each time 
and update before keep removing. If upper limit remove fraction is reached, no more edges will 
be removed for each node. On the contrary, if one node cannot find any candidate edge, even 
upper limit has not been reached the node will not remove any edge further. 
The parameters of epidemic models are fixed for each network. As shown in table 2, we record 
the changes of infection ratio with spreading days in SI model to see how these strategies can 
affect the disease spreading. We also vary remove fraction to test that to what extent these 
strategies can control the disease in SIR model. The epidemic situations are measured by the 
percentage of infected node (SI model) and epidemic size, duration and peak (SIR model). 
Total removed edges are also recorded since one strategy leads to low epidemic size may not be 
the best control strategies if it totally removes more edges than other strategies in same 
circumstance. 
All strategies are tried in this part except remove “SI link” strategy, because this experiment is 
aimed at comparing with global strategies which does not need the epidemic information. What 
we want to find out here is whether it is possible to get same control effect as global strategies 
only using local information. 
3.1.2 Experiment two: local- prevalence-based 
The setting of parameters, variables and outputs in this experiment are the same as experiment 
one (as shown in Table 2) except that edge removal strategies are applied during the disease 
spreading instead of at beginning. Additionally, global strategies will not be applied since this 
experiment is mainly for finding the effects of behavioural changes based on local information. 
Therefore “SI link” strategy will be used to compare with our local strategies in this experiment. 
When a node is infected, it will apply the strategies immediately before infecting other nodes.  
3.1.3 Experiment three: global- prevalence-based 
This experiment is a combination of experiment one and two. When the disease is spreading, 
the infected nodes will become aware and apply the edge removal strategies (just like 
experiment two). We set a global step which means that in this step, all nodes that have not been 
infected will apply the strategies (like experiment one). We vary this global step variable to see 
whether these edge removal strategies (when stands for belief-based and prevalence-based 
global behavioural changes) have different performances in belief and prevalence based global 
model. 
We only use community network, SIR model and outputs of epidemic size and total removed 
edges in this experiment. The reason is that all strategies perform best in community network. 
For simplicity, SIR model and epidemic size are enough to conduct this experiment. 
3.1.4 Experiment four: local- belief-based 
In order to find out how local belief-based behavioural changes can affect disease spread, we 
use SIIR model to allow awareness spread. This means that not only infected nodes but also

aware nodes will apply edge removal strategies. In this case, infected nodes become aware and 
aware node will infect other unaware nodes. We also add an asymptomatic infected state before 
infectious state in SIR model to see whether awareness spread will help disease control in 
consideration of the fact that removal strategies may not always be applied in time before 
infected nodes start infecting. So beside remove fraction variable, asymptomatic duration and 
awareness transmission rate are varied as well. 
3.1.5 Other experiments: 
After conducting previous four experiments, it is surprising that one of our strategies (named 
“Local Modularity”) has extremely good control of disease in networks with community 
structure. So we continue to do three more experiments focusing on the effects of network 
properties including cluster coefficient, degree distribution and community strength on the 
performance of the “Local Modularity” strategy. Epidemic models and behavioural changes 
models are fixed in this part for simplicity. The details of experiments are shown in Table 3.

3.2 Networks used in experiments 
We use totally five types of networks that have been widely used in epidemic studies, including 
random network, exponential network, scale-free network, community network and real 
network. The properties of these networks have been discussed in section 2.1. In this section we 
mainly focus on the generation and data source of these networks. All networks used in our 
experiments are undirected and unweighted. 
3.2.1 Random network 
The random network in our experiment is generated using the Erdös-Rényi binomial model. 
There are 128 nodes in this network and each pair of nodes is connected with probability 1%, 
which results in total 859 edges. It is automatically generated using library of JUNG graph 
framework (edu.uci.ics.jung.algorithms.generators.random.ErdosRenyiGenerator<V, E>).

3.2.2 Exponential network 
First we use JUNG to generate a random network with 168 nodes and 650 edges (each pair of 
nodes is connected with probability 0.05). Then we rewired it to exponential degree distribution 
by using greedy rewiring algorithm in [Bansal et al. 2007]. 
For the purpose of experiment in section 3.1.5, we also rewire the exponential networks to have 
different average clustering coefficients using algorithm in [Bansal et al. 2009]. We generated 
5 exponential networks with same properties except the clustering coefficient. (See Table4)

Table 4: Parameters of exponential networks 
3.2.3 Scale-free network 
To generate a scale-free network, we use an improved preferential attachment method in 
[Batagelj and Brandes 2005] to add a node each time and create edges between it and the 
existing nodes with the probability proportional to existing nodes’ degrees. The generated 
scale-free network contains 128 nodes and 542 edges totally with mean degree to be 8. 
3.2.4 Community network 
To construct community networks, we use a program implementing the algorithm described in 
the paper [Lancichinetti and Fortunato 2009]. The algorithm is called 
Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark (denote as LFR) which can construct undirected 
and unweighted network with community structure and power-law degree distribution. When 
running the program, there is a mixing parameter to control the community strength. It stands 
for the ratio of external degree of total degree. The higher the mixing parameter, the lower the 
community strength will be. We generated five Girvan-Newman benchmark kind networks as 
shown in table5.

also generate a community network with same degree distribution as a scale-free network

using Pajek which is a software of large network analysis and visualization developed 
by Vladimir Batagelj and Andrej Mrvar. The community network has totally 508 edges and 
128 nodes. The degree distribution is shown in Figure 9:

The community network and scale-free network have same network parameters except that 
the community network contains four communities. (See Figure 10) 
3.2.5 Real network 
It is hard to find a real network related for a specific disease. Because having knowledge of 
every individual and relationship leading to infection is a time consuming and complex task. 
Since our experiments are aimed at testing the performance of edge removal strategies. We find 
three datasets used in real network tests: blogs, school and global flight network. The first two 
are social networks and the flight network is a real life network but is not social network. 
1) “Blogs” network 
“Blogs” is a network of blogs on the Window LiveTM  Spaces platform from [Gregory 2009]. 
This network has strong community structure with totally 273 communities found by 
“InfoMap” community detection algorithm. There are totally 3982 nodes and 6803 edges in 
this network. 
2) “School” network 
“School” network is generated from a high school contact data of a day from [Salathé et al. 
2010]. We only kept the contacts with duration longer than 5 second to form a network work 
with totally 786 nodes and 20345 edges. This dataset (have been mentioned above) is

Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      22 
S Ia  I R 
collected using wireless sensor network technology and records high-resolution data of close 
proximity interactions among students, teachers and staffs during a typical day at an 
American high school. This dataset is collected particularly for influenza-like disease study so 
it is highly relevant to our project, although the data only records one day contact. 
3) “Flight” network 
We find a dataset of real global flight network from [Marcelino and Kaiser 2012]. This paper 
test alternative strategies using edge removal as cancelling targeted flight connection for 
controlling influenza spreading over airline network. They obtained scheduled flight data for 
one year provided by OAG Aviation Solutions (Luton, UK). 500 top airports which represent 
95% of the global traffic are selected to form this dataset (totally 13038 edges). We choose this 
dataset for the reason that this comes from real data and our edge removal strategies also accord 
with the flight cancellation scenario. The difference between our strategies and the strategies in 
paper [Marcelino and Kaiser 2012] is that we only find removal edges using local information. 
3.3 Epidemic models 
Since our edge removal strategies care about the individual heterogeneity and different network 
topologies, stochastic agent based epidemic models are our best choices. In this section, we are 
going to introduce our threes epidemic models in detail, including SI model, SIR model and 
SIIR model.

Figure 11: An illustration of epidemic model with parameters S (susceptible), Ia (asymptomatic 
infectious), I (symptomatic infectious), R (recovered), ? (infection rate), n (asymptomatic duration), ? 
(recover rate) 
3.3.1 SIIR model 
Here we define SIIR model as shown in Figure 11: each node can be in one of four possible 
states: S (susceptible), Ia  (asymptomatic infectious), I (symptomatic infectious), R (recovered). 
Initially all nodes are susceptible and one node will be chosen randomly to be in asymptomatic 
state. At each time step (one day), node in susceptible state can be infected by its neighbour in 
asymptomatic or symptomatic infectious state with probability ?, which means that if one node 
has k neighbours in state Ia  or I, the probability of being infected will be 1-(1-?)^k. Once a 
node in state S is infected, it will transfer to state Ia . Each node in state Ia  takes n days to 
become state I and then become recovered state R with probability ?. During a number of time 
steps, the initial infection can spread through the network and the simulation will be halted once 
no node is in state Ia  or I. 
3.3.2 SIR model and SI model 
After defining SIIR model, both SIR model and SI model can be transferred from SIIR model. 
When we set n=0, state Ia  will no longer exist and the model turns into SIR model. Similarly, if 
both n and ? are set to be 0, only state S and state I will be left. Thus SIIR model becomes SI 
model. 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      23 
3.3.3 Statistics of epidemic model 
The values of parameters used in these models vary according to different specific disease. 
Since we are not concentrate on one specific disease but a category of flu-like infectious disease 
which are transmitted from person to person by the respiratory or close-contact, we use the 
method introduced in paper [Salathé and Jones 2010] to decide our epidemic parameters. In 
epidemiology, R0 (the basic reproduction number) represents the number of nodes that one 
node can infect on average over its infectious period. If R0<1 the infection will die out 
otherwise infection will spread in a population. R0 is widely used in mathematical models 
particularly in ordinary differential equations but cannot be used in our agent-based model. 
However, paper [Salathé and Jones 2010] mentioned that transmission rate ? can be chosen 
according to the relationship that R0~ (?/?)*d=3 where d is the mean network degree, and ? is 
the recovery rate. They choose ? =0.2(an average infectious period of 5 days) and R0=3 
because these parameter values reflect most widespread infectious diseases in previous studies. 
Therefore, we also set R0=3 and let the infectious period to be 5 days in our simulation (?=0.2). 
So the transmission rate ? in different networks can be calculated as following in Table 6. 
Table 6: Epidemic parameters for different networks 
3.3.4 Awareness spread model 
In our model, only aware nodes will apply edge remove strategies. Nodes can be aware in 
different step by different means according to different experiment purpose (explained in 
section 3.1). For the global condition, all nodes become aware at same time influenced by 
public information. For the local, infected nodes become aware and the awareness can spread, 
which is same as disease spread (see Figure 12). Unaware node affected by its aware neighbour 
by probability w. If w=0, no awareness spreads. 
 
Figure 12: Awareness spread model 
3.4 Edge removal strategies 
Since behavioural changes are conducted by the individual who has limited knowledge of the 
whole network, the strategies used to select critical edges since each node can only use local 
information. We modified range of different measurements of network parameters including

similarity, degree, clustering coefficient, community strength and so on to form five candidate 
local edge removal strategies. In the following part, we will firstly provide all our modified 
local edge removal strategies and then give an introduction of those strategies we used to 
compare with. 
3.4.1 Local edge removal strategies 
When we apply these strategies, we try not to cause nodes with zero degree because in real life 
no individual can be totally isolated. Therefore, we will not remove an edge to the node only 
having one degree even if this edge is the best choice calculated by these strategies.  
1) Similarity 
We use Jaccard similarity coefficient proposed by Jaccard in paper [Jaccard 1901] to measure 
how similar neighbourhood connectivity structure of each node and its neighbours are. The 
Jaccard similarity coefficient are defined as ???????? =
|????? |
|????? |
 , where ?i  equals to the degree 
of node i. This equation calculates the ratio of common neighbours between two nodes. If two 
vertice have exact same degrees, the similarity coefficient reaches maximum value of 1. 
Otherwise, a low coefficient reveals that the two vertice may belong to different network 
structure (e.g. community structure) and the edge connecting them will become a good target to 
remove resulting in a separate the two network structures. Therefore, each time for each node 
we firstly calculate the similarity between the node and each of its neighbours. Secondly we 
remove the edge leading to the neighbour that has the lowest similarity.  
2) Clustering Coefficient (denote as CC) 
Clustering Coefficient has been introduced in section 2.1 and local clustering coefficient of a 
node measures to how closely the neighbours are connected to each other which is viewed as a 
level of clustering. So we are going to find the critical edge for each node in purpose of 
increasing CC. 
The steps for each node are described as following:  
a) Calculate the original CC for the node 
b) Calculate the changes of CC for removing each edge of the node respectively 
c) Choose the edge that can increase CC mostly to remove 
 
3) LFM 
We modify a local community detection algorithm called local fitness maximization (LFM) in 
paper [Lancichinetti et al. 2009] to try to find those intercommunity edges. Fitness of subgraph 
g is used to measure a community in paper [Lancichinetti et al. 2009] and is defined as: 
?? =
???
?
(???
?
+ ????
?
)?
 
, where ???
?
 and ????
?
 are the total internal and external degrees of the nodes in community g 
and ? is a positive value to control the size of the community. The community detection method 
starts from a node A and aims to find the largest fitness by adding new nodes or removing 
existing nodes in community, which means that the final detected community from node A will 
have lower ??  if a new node is added or a node of the community is removed. They also 
introduced a concept of node fitness ??
?  which is the fitness of node A in sub-graph g and is 
defined as the variation of sub-graph fitness with and without node A [Lancichinetti et al. 
2009]: 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      25 
??
? = ??+{?} ? ???{?} 
In each iteration step, they find the neighbour with the largest fitness and add it into the 
sub-graph g. Then they recalculate the fitness of each node and removes the one has negative 
fitness. After each add and remove action, the fitness of each node will be updated and the 
algorithm will continue to iteration until all neighbours of sub-graph g have negative value. At 
the end, the generated sub-graph is the largest community from A. 
When it comes to our modified strategy, we define an edge fitness based on the idea of node 
fitness in paper [Lancichinetti et al. 2009] which is variation of sub-graph fitness with and 
without the target edge. The fitness of edge e connecting node A and node n can be defined as: 
??
? = ??+{?} ? ???{?} 
, where sub-graph g consists of node A and its neighbours and ? ? {?} here means node n is 
moved out of subgraph g and edge e is removed from original graph. Our idea of finding critical 
edges for each node is similar with paper [Lancichinetti et al. 2009], which is to remove the 
edge with lowest negative edge fitness value. After testing various ? values, we find that ?=2 
has the best performance in our experiment, so we set ?=2 in all experiments. When we apply 
the definition to our experiment, the fitness of sub-graph g which consists of node A and its 
neighbours can be calculated as: 
??
? =
2 ? ???????? ??????
(???????? ??????? + ???????? ???????)2
 
The fitness of each edge from node A can be calculated as: 
??
?? =  
2 ? ?
(2 ? ? + ?)2
?
2 ? ? ? 2 ? ?
(2 ? ? + ? ? ? ? ? ? 1)2
 
, where ei stand for the fitness of edge connecting node A and node I, I is the total internal 
degrees of sub-graph g, E is the total external degrees of sub-graph g, i is internal degree of 
node I and e is the external degree of node i. 
The LFM strategy for each target node consists of following steps: 
a) Consider the target node and its neighbours as a sub-graph g and calculate the sub-graph 
fitness ??  
b) Calculate the edge fitness for each edge of target node 
c) Remove the edge with lowest fitness value 
d) If no edge has negative fitness value, no edge will be removed 
Following is an example: 
Suppose node A will apply the LFM strategy (see Figure 13). Nodes in dark blue colour are the 
neighbours of node A named from 1 to 6. They construct a sub-graph named g. The red lines are 
external degrees of sub-graph g while green lines are the internal degrees. 
Calculate fitness of sub-graph g (consist of node A and its neighbours, see Figure 13):

?3  has the lowest fitness value, so the edge connecting node A and node 3 will be removed. 
Then go back to step a). Sub-graph fitness ??  will become 0.0255 and the edge fitnesss of e1, 
e2, e4, e5 and e6 will be updated. If there is a negative value, we can continue remove the edge 
of node A with lowest value. Otherwise on edge of node A will be removed any more. 
 
Figure 13: An illustration of sub-graph start from node A 
4) Local Modularity (denote as LM) 
This strategy is also modified from a local community detection algorithm in paper [Clauset 
2005]. As shown in Figure 14, paper [Clauset 2005] defines a measure of local community C 
by taking the boundary of C into consideration. Boundary B of C makes up of those nodes in the 
subset of C that have at least one neighbour in U. It is expected that community structure tends 
to have sharp boundary with larger proportion of connections from boundary to local 
community C and fewer to the unknown part U that is outside of community.

They measure a local community using local modularity R which is defined as [Clauset 2005]: 
? =
 ??? ?(?, ?)??
 ?????
=
?
?
   , 
Where ???  is 1 if nodes I and j are connected and either node is in B and ?(?, ?) is 1 when 
either node i ? B and node j ? C or vice versa. T is the number of edges that with at least one 
endpoint in B while I is the number of edges in T with no endpoint in U.  
This local modularity R lies from 0 to 1. If R=1 it means that a complete community is found 
which has no edges leading to unknown part U. It means that no intercommunity edge exists. 
Therefore, we tend to remove those edges that can increase R mostly by assuming that removed 
edges have high possibility to be intercommunity edges. 
Suppose node A will apply “Local Modularity” strategy. The steps can be described as follows: 
a) Consider node A and its neighbours as local community C and find the B for C 
b) Calculate R of local community C 
c) For each neighbour i in B: Define ??  is the number of external degrees of node i 
which connecting nodes in U, ??  are defined as the number of internal degrees of 
node I that connecting nodes in C (except node A) and  ???? ? is defined as the 
nodes in C but not in B (except A) connecting node i and ??  is defined as number of 
the degrees of node j connecting other nodes in C but not in B (include node A). e is 
the number of edges that  ???? ? are connecting each other. 
d) Calculate ∆?? = ? ?  
?????1+ ????
????1+ ????
 
e) Choose the edge from node A to node i that ∆??  is lowest negative value. If there is 
no negative value, no edge of node A will be removed otherwise iterate from step a).

Node 3 is in C not in B, so ignore it. Since ∆?4  is the lowest negative value, the edge from 
node A to node 4 will be removed.

5) High degree 
According to the study in [Marcelino and Kaiser 2012], hub removal strategy has been 
regarded as an effective way to stop influenza spreading over the airline network by shutting 
down the highly connected airport. Highly connected nodes are found by knowing the whole 
network information. We modified it so that it can be applied by individual node in a local way. 
Each time when a node needs to apply the “high degree” strategy, it firstly calculates the 
degrees of all of its neighbours. Then the node will remove edge to the neighbour with highest 
degree. High degree nodes are more likely to be infected and to spread diseases to more other 
nodes. Therefore, removing edge from high degree nodes is expected to keep them uninfected 
and reduce the opportunity of getting infected from them as well. 
3.4.2  Strategies used to contrast 
1) Global EdgeBetweenness strategy 
The betweenness of an edge is defined as the times that it is belongs to shortest paths between 
all pairs of nodes. It reveals how important an edge is in connecting the whole network. Edges 
with high betweenness value tend to have more important role to delay or stop the disease 
spreading. We implement the strategy based on the library from JUNG which is based on the 
algorithm in paper [Girvan and Newman 2002]. It calculates edge betweenness for all edges in 
the graph and returns desired numbers of edges with highest betweenness value. In our strategy, 
we remove these edges with high betweenness value to rewire the network. The running time is 
O(kmn) where k is the number of edges to remove, m is the total number of edges, and n is the 
total number of nodes. The problem of this strategy is that it takes long running time in large 
network (e.g. global flight network with 500 nodes and 13038 edges) so we find another 
strategy to use in large network described in 2). 
2) “InfoMap” strategy 
“InfoMap” is a community detection algorithm of Martin Rosvall and Carl T which use the 
probability flow of random walks on a network to reveal community structure. We firstly run 
“InfoMap” strategy to find all communities and then regard all intercommunity edges as 
candidate removal edges. The above two strategies are all global for they need the information

of whole network. Although our edge removal strategies are only using local information, they 
still can be compared with these two global ones when all nodes in the network apply local edge 
removal strategies at same time. For time complexity reason, we use “global EdgeBetweenness” 
strategy in small networks and use “InfoMap” in large networks. 
3) Remove SI link strategy 
As reviewed in [Funk et al. 2010], individual’s behavioural changes may lead to susceptible 
nodes removing edge from infected nodes, which has been studied by a lot of researchers. 
[Shaw and Schwartz 2008][Bagnoli and Sguanci 2007]. Therefore, we also compare our local 
strategies with this kind of automatic changes by individuals. We implement it in a way that 
each node finds all of its infected neighbours and removes edges from these infected nodes 
randomly according to remove fraction. 
3.5 The simulation algorithm 
All simulations were implemented in Java using the JUNG (http://jung.sourceforge.net/) graph 
framework for the graph data model. For the whole experiment, we used a Monte Carlo 
approach and averaged results from 150 runs for each possible combination on theoretical 
networks and 300 times on real dataset. The disease starting node is chosen at random each run. 
The input parameters of simulation are summarized in table 7 below: 
Parameter name Explanation 
Infection rate (?) 
This is calculated according to specific network (Method has been 
discussed in section 3.3.3). 
Each iterative step, for each neighbour of infected nodes, a random number 
r in (0,1] is generated; If ? >= r, the neighbor become infected. 
Asymptomatic 
infectious 
duration (n) 
If n=0: SIR model;  
If n>0: SIIR model;  
When a node get infected, it will be in state asymptomatic I for n step and 
then become symptomatic I state. 
Recover rate (?) 
All nodes in state symptomatic I take d steps (d=5? ?=0.2) to become state 
R.  
If d? ∞(? = 0): SI model;  
Otherwise SIR or SIIR model. 
Network data 
All network (undirected and unweighted) data are stored in Pajek NET 
format. 
Remove fraction 
(denote as rf) 
Maximum remove limit for each node; 
Strategy number 
Define which strategy to use; 
Maximum step 
Simulation will stop if reach maximum step or there is no node in state I 
Global step 
-1:  All nodes become aware and apply strategy before disease start; 
(-1, maximum step):  infected nodes apply strategy first and at global 
step all nodes have not applied will apply strategy; 
> Maximum step:  only aware nodes apply strategy. 
Awareness spread 
rate (?) 
Infected nodes become aware; 
Each iterative step, for each unaware neighbour of aware nodes, a random 
number r in (0,1] is generated, if ? > ? unaware neighbour become aware; 
w = 0: No awareness spread, only infected nodes become aware.

Figure 16: Ratio of infected nodes in SI model in Random and Exponential network with different 
remove fraction (rf) 
As can be seen in Figure 16, our five candidate local edge removal strategies are applied before 
disease start in random and exponential network respectively. The disease is spreading in SI 
model which means that all nodes will be infected at last if the network has not been separated. 
In the random network (a), it shows that local edge removal strategy can delay the disease 
spread compared with no strategy applied, but random removal has similar performance with 
purposive removal. However, when it comes to exponential network (c), we can see that 
“Similarity” performances much better than other strategies since it leads to fewer nodes to be 
infected at last. When we compare (a) and (b) or (c) and (d), we can find that increasing remove 
fraction results in better control for all strategies, especially for “Similarity” in exponential 
network which separates the network. “CC” strategy shows better delay function in disease 
spread with more edges being removed but still infects all nodes at last. For the other strategies, 
their performances are just similar with random removal even when more edges are removed. 
Therefore, it can be known that “Similarity” and “CC” can be more effective when each node 
removes more edges. 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      31 
 
(a) Scale-free rf = 0.1 
 
(b) Scale-free rf = 0.2 
 
(c) Community rf =0.1 
 
(d) Community rf = 0.2 
Figure 17: Ratio of infected nodes in SI model in Scale-free and community network with different 
remove fraction (rf) 
Figure 17 has same compare structure as Figure 16 except that the test networks are replaced by 
scale-free network and community network. From (a) and (b), it is clear that increasing remove 
fraction for each node is useful in scale-free network, which is same as random and exponential 
network. The difference is that “LFM”, “Local Modularity” and “High degree” strategies 
present better delay in first 20 days of outbreaks even better than “Similarity”. When we do test 
in community network, totally different pictures are revealed in Figure 17 (c) and (d) compared 
with previous three kind of networks. Even only 10% edges are removed for each node; 
“Similarity”, “LFM” and “Local Modularity” display nearly twice delay in disease spread 
when 50% nodes are infected (30 days in contrast to 15 days for other strategies). What’s more, 
when remove fraction becomes 20%, these three strategies totally isolate the infection area, 
which only lead to approximately 20% nodes being infected at last. 
On the whole, we can see that local edge removal strategies indeed helpful in delaying or 
controlling disease spread and some of them perform extremely well in network with 
community structure. Although in other network structures, they cannot isolate the infection 
area completely, delay function has been found in early steps of epidemic process. Therefore, 
we tend to study them in SIR model in next section hoping that disease can die out in early stage 
because of this delay phenomenon. Since it has been shown that more removed edges result in 
better performance, we also study the effect of remove fraction further in the following part. 
4.1.2  Epidemic results on different remove fraction 
In this part, we apply local edge removal strategies on four kind of networks using SIR model 
as epidemic model to see how remove fraction can influence epidemic process. Firstly in the 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      32 
random network as revealed by Figure 18 (a) and (c), when remove fraction is enhanced, 
epidemic size and peak are decreased and disease will die out at 50% remove fraction. All 
strategies have similar performance in disease control except “Local Modularity” and this is 
due to its fewer total removed edges at same remove fraction compared with other strategies (as 
shown in (d)). Remove fraction is an up removal limit for each node. This means that if some 
strategies cannot find suitable edge to remove, they will not remove any more even up removal 
limit has not been reached. So we can see that “Local Modularity” strategy has stricter 
requirement in choosing candidate edges than others. With remove fraction increasing, for all 
strategies, the epidemic duration first ascends to be higher than no strategy situation and then 
continues to decrease to be much lower than no strategy situation. Purposive removal does not 
give improvement compared with completely random removal. 
 
(a) Epidemic size 
 
(b) Epidemic duration 
 
(c) Epidemic peak 
 
(d) Total removed edges 
Figure 18: Random network in SIR model 
The effect of remove fraction to epidemic size, peak, duration and total removed edges in 
exponential network resembles that in random network. The main different is that each strategy 
has different performance in exponential network. From Figure 19 (a) and (c), “LFM” and 
“High degree” have better performance than “similarity” and random removal when remove 
fraction is large enough and they totally remove fewer edges either shown in (d). Although 
“Local Modularity” and “CC” do not perform as well as other strategies, they also remove 
much fewer edges. Therefore it is hard to say whether “Local Modularity” and “CC” have bad 
or good control in epidemic. Additionally, it seems that strategies leading to lower epidemic 
size tend to have longer epidemic duration when remove fraction is not high enough, which is 
revealed from (a) and (b) when remove fraction is between 0.3 and 0.4. 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks

When it comes to scale-free network (see Figure 20), the situation is quite similar with the one 
in exponential network except that “Local Modularity” results in better epidemic control than 
“CC”, “Similarity” and “Random” removal for removing much fewer edges. “LFM” and “High 
degree” are still better than “Random” and “Similarity” since they remove same number of 
edges but have lower epidemic size and peak. “Local Modularity” also deserves study for it is 
the third best in disease control with fewest totally removed edges.

(b) Epidemic duration 
 
(c) Epidemic peak 
 
(d) Total removed edges 
Figure 21: Community network in SIR model 
As in section 4.1.1, when apply these local edge removal strategies in network with community 
structure, some strategies present extremely good effects in disease control. From Figure 21 (a), 
(b) and (c), we can see that “LFM”, “Local Modularity” and “Similarity” are better than any 
other strategies from low remove fraction. For these three strategies, from 10% to 13% remove 
fraction, epidemic size drops drown quickly. Then from 13% remove fraction, epidemic size 
keeps stable for “Local Modularity” and decreases slowly for “LFM” and “Similarity” until 
disease dies out. We can see from (d) that “LFM” and “Similarity” removes equal edges with 
other strategies (except “Local Modularity”) but perform nearly twice better than other 
strategies (except “Local Modularity”) at 10% remove fraction. However, with remove fraction 
growing, this advantage becomes smaller until no advantage shown at 40% remove fraction. 
Same situation is also viewed in measure of epidemic duration and peak. The most special case 
come to “Local Modularity” strategy, which shows a threshold at 13% remove fraction. As 
shown in (d), even remove fraction keeps increasing, “Local Modularity” only removes little 
more edges between 10% and 13% remove fraction and then no more edges are removed 
further. That is also why epidemic size, peak and duration keep unchanged from 13% to 40% 
remove fraction. When compare “Local Modularity” with “LFM” and “Similarity” in (a) and 
(d), it can be seen that at 14% remove fraction, they lead to same epidemic size but “Local 
Modularity” removes approximately twice fewer edges than the other two. When remove 
fraction becomes 40%, although “LFM” and “Similarity” totally control the disease spread, 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      35 
they remove six times edges as many as “Local Modularity”, which account for 60% of the total 
edges in network. Obviously, the more edges are removed the better the disease can be 
controlled since all nodes are isolated. So the reason that “LFM” and “Similarity” perform 
better than “Local Modularity” is because they remove too many edges. Therefore, we can 
conclude that “Local Modularity” should be the best strategy in community network because it 
removes fewer edges and reach a satisfying control result. Also it will not continue to remove 
more edges if all critical edges have been found, which means that it has a high accuracy 
compared with “LFM” and “Similarity” which find critical edges at the cost of much more 
removed edges. 
In summary, except random network, local edge removal strategies could effectively delay and 
stop disease spread, especially in community network. “LFM” and “High degree” performed 
best in exponential and scale-free network when remove fraction was large enough while 
“Local Modularity”, “LFM” and “Similarity” showed best disease control in community 
network. The higher the remove fraction, the better the disease could be controlled. “Local 
Modularity” was different from all other strategies and it was more accurate in find critical 
edges. It separated the community by only removing fewer edges and would stop removing 
once community has been separated. Although it did not show best results in random, 
exponential and scale-free network, it might because it removed much fewer than other 
strategies at same circumstance. Therefore, “Local Modularity” was the best strategy so far for 
its excellent performance in community network.

Table 8 shows the total removed edges for each strategy in different network from figure 20 (a)

strategy is set to remove same number of edges as best local edge removal strategy for 
comparison. Table 9 is the detail of total removed edges for each strategy in flight network. 
Since “Global EdgeBetweenness” is computing complexity demanding, we use the data from 
[Marcelino and Kaiser 2009] to make a comparison.

structure. rf stands for remove fraction. 
As revealed by Figure 22 (a) to (c) and table 8, “EdgeBetweenness” leads to much fewer 
infected nodes at the end of epidemic than other strategies. It seems that “EdgeBetweenness” 
removes the most critical edges that connecting the different parts in the whole network so that 
disease has been kept in only one part of network. Even in networks without community 
structure, it still can separate the network while local edge removal strategy seems has no such 
ability. However, in the community network (d), we can find that “Local Modularity” performs 
as well as “EdgeBetweenness” with same number of removed edges. Although the local edge 
removal strategy have higher final infection ratio, in the early stage of epidemic process in (a)

and (b), local strategies delay the infection better than the global one and this will be studied 
further in flight network (see Figure 22 (e) ). 
Figure 22 (e) is the testing results in real global flight network. Paper [Marcelino and Kaiser 
2009] found that removing high betweenness edges (cancel flight line) is better than removing 
hub nodes (shut down airport with highest centrality) in slowing down the disease spread 
(shown in (f)). “Edge betweenness” was regarded as superior at predicting the most critical 
edges. However, it is quite slow to calculate in larger network. From (f), the time step where 
half of the nodes are infected is 23 after 25% of edges are removed by “Edge betweenness” 
while in our study (Figure 22 (e)), the time step for “LFM” is 28 and “Local Modularity” is 26 
applying the same condition. The final infection ratio is more than 90% for “Edge betweenness” 
in (e), which is same as “Similarity” in (f). This means that local edge removal strategy can 
delay disease spread at least as well as “global edge betweenness” only using local information 
and not be computationally as costly as “Edge betweenness”.

Figure 23: Compare with global EdgeBetweenness strategy using SIR model 
Since local edge removal strategies show better delay functions than “Global 
EdgeBetweenness” in early epidemic stage, we test them in SIR model further to see whether 
disease can die out early if we increase remove fraction for each node. As can be seen in 
Figure 23, we use SIR model epidemic model to compare the performance of local and global 
edge removal strategies in different remove fraction for each node. Only those good strategies 
in section 4.1.2 are used to compare with “Global EdgeBetweenness”. The details of total 
removed edges in different remove fraction are shown in table.10. In random network 
“EdgeBetweenness 1” is set to remove similar number of edges with “Similarity” and “LFM” 
strategies while “EdgeBetweenness 2” remove as many as “Local Modularity” algorithm. 
Similarly, in scale-free network, “EdgeBetweenness” is set to remove same amount as “LFM” 
and similar amount with “Similarity” and “High degree”. “Similarity” and “EdgeBetweenness” 
have equal total removed edges in exponential network, which is also same situation for “Local

Figure 23 (a), (b) and (d) all demonstrate that “EdgeBetweenness” perform better than local 
strategies at low remove fraction, but when remove fraction large enough, local strategies will 
lead to same or lower epidemic size comparing “EdgeBetweenness”. On the other hand, 
“EdgeBetweenness” continues to have better epidemic control than “Similarity” no matter how 
remove fraction changes. 
The result shown in section 4.1.2 is that “Local Modularity” is the best candidate local remove 
strategy in community network. So we are going to test it further with global strategy 
particularly in real network. Since “EdgeBetweenness” has high computational cost real world 
larger network, we use another global strategy called “InfoMap” to instead. Since it is a global 
strategy, it will not remove edges according to remove fraction. Firstly we run “InfoMap” to 
find all intercommunity edges and then get the epidemic result after removing all these edges as 
a reference. We vary the remove fraction for “Local Modularity” to compare with “InfoMap” 
both in SI and SIR model. 
Firstly, we run the test in the two social networks: “Blogs” and “School” networks. From 
Figure 24 (a) and (b), “InfoMap” completely control the disease spread by removing all 
intercommunity edges which account for 18.6% of total edges. All other strategies perform 
better than random removal except that “CC” is incomparable because it removes fewest 
edges and has highest epidemic size. “LFM” and “Local Modularity” show smallest epidemic 
size but “Local Modularity” removes much fewer edges than “LFM”. So “Local Modularity” 
is still the best among all candidate local edge removal strategies. When compare it to global 
“InfoMap” strategy, in order to reach same epidemic size, “Local Modularity” needs to 
remove twice edges of “InfoMap” at 50% remove fraction. The “Blogs” network consists of 
273 communities, so the size for each community is small. Thus when “InfoMap” isolates 
these communities, the disease dies out extremely quickly. Although “Local Modularity” 
cannot perform as well as “InfoMap”, but at 25% remove fraction where they remove same 
number of edges, the epidemic size for “Local Modularity” is also very low about 15%. When 
it comes to “School” network (see Figure 24 (c) and (d)) which shows scale-free property, 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      39 
“InfoMap” plays approximately four times better than local edge removal strategies at same 
total removed edges (19% remove fraction). The performance of local edge removal strategies 
seems incomparable because the strategy leads to low epidemic size also removes more edges. 
The “school” network has low community strength since the intercommunity edges account 
for 32% of total edges. So the performance of local edge removal strategies is similar with 
that in theoretical scale-free network. (See Figure 20)

(b) Total removed edges, “Blogs” network 
 
(c) Epidemic size, “School” network 
 
(d) Total removed edges, “School” network 
Figure 24: Compare Local Modularity with “InfoMap” in “Blogs” and “School” network 
Secondly, we test it on real global flight network. Comparing “Local Modularity” with 
“InfoMap” in SI model (see Figure 25 a and b), “InfoMap” keeps the infection ratio at around 
30% when disease spreads on the 70
th
 day by removing lower than 15% edges while the best 
result of “Local Modularity” on 70th day is around four times worse by removing more than 17% 
edges. We can see that with the growth of remove fraction, the final number of infected nodes 
firstly drop and then remain unchanged. This is because that the total removed edges reach an 
upper limit when remove fraction is larger than 50% as shown in (b). Since “InfoMap” removes 
all intercommunity edges, we can assume that “Local Modularity” finds most of the 
intercommunity edges but not all of them. So the epidemic has been controlled but not as well 
as that in “InfoMap” due to that the communities in network have not been totally isolated. 
There is no recover in SI model, so all nodes will be infected if the network is connected. We 
just use SI model to test how well those strategies can isolate the communities. In order to 
accord with realistic epidemic process, we continue to compare them in SIR model below.

(c) Epidemic size in SIR model 
 
(d) Total removed edges in SIR model 
Figure 25: Compare Local Modularity with “InfoMap” in flight network 
As in (b), in (d) we also first run “InfoMap” to remove all intercommunity edges and get the 
epidemic size in (c). When comparing “Local Modularity” with other local strategies, we can 
see that at 14% remove fraction, other local strategies already totally remove twice edges as 
many as “Local Modularity” but have similar epidemic size. Thus we only continue to increase 
remove fraction for “Local Modularity” to see whether it can reach same control results as 
“InfoMap”. With the increasing of remove fraction, the epidemic size for “Local Modularity” 
keeps decreasing and equals that in “InfoMap” between 30% and 40% remove fraction with 
only fewer than 2% more edges removing. Disease even dies out when “Local Modularity” 
removes 5% of total edges more than “InfoMap” at 60% remove fraction. 
In conclusion, after comparing local strategies with global strategies, we found that local 
strategies could perform as well as global ones in SIR model in some networks if remove 
fraction was high enough. “Local Modularity” could even delay the early spreading of disease 
in community and flight network in SI model and reached a satisfying final infection ratio. 
Although “InfoMap” had perfect disease control in “real network”, “Local Modularity” 
showed a relative good control results in network with community structure either. Due to 
noisy or incomplete network information in real life, “Local Modularity” is more practice and 
robust to use in real life compared with “InfoMap” or “EdgeBetweenness”. Therefore, it is 
possible to only use local information and consume less computing cost to get the similar 
epidemic control as global strategies. 
4.2 All population aware in different time steps 
In the previous experiments, we only consider that the whole population becomes aware before 
epidemic is known (all strategies applied before disease start). Actually in real life, population 
may make behavioural changes after disease prevalence, so in this section, we vary the time 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      41 
when strategies are applied to make a contrast. 
 
(a) Epidemic size 
 
(b) Total removed edges 
Figure 26: Community network in SIR model 
As shown in Figure 26, the earlier the strategies are applied the lower the epidemic size will be 
for “Similarity”, “LFM” and “Local Modularity” strategies, but it will also cause more edges to 
be removed. For other strategies, although more edges are removed if all population becomes 
aware earlier, the performance does not show much difference in contrast to later applying. 
Therefore, it cannot conclude that it is better for epidemic control if all population conducts 
behavioural changes earlier, because more edges will be needed to remove also. 
4.3 Behavioural changes happen during disease spread

(a) Epidemic size 
 
(b) Total removed edges 
Figure 27: Compare global and local in community network using SI model (Local Modularity denote 
as LM) 
After viewing the result in previous section, there is a strong possibility that local strategies 
may not need to be applied completely before disease start and still can result in good disease 
control. So we conduct an experiment to let node apply strategy only when it is infected (local) 
instead of before disease spreading (global). From Figure 27(a), we can find that strategies 
applied globally indeed have better performance than local ones at small remove fraction. 
However, when remove fraction increase, this superiority become descending and finally they 
get same performance at 20% remove fraction with local ones removing only half total 
removed edges of the global ones. It can be seen that strategies applied globally perform better 
in small remove fraction due to removing more edges and if remove fraction high enough, local

application can be equally effective with fewer edges removing. Although local application of 
strategies need higher remove fraction to get same performance as global ones, the total 
removed edges are not higher but even lower. So it seems that only individual in disease 
prevalence area to make behavioural changes would be enough for disease control if they could 
remove critical edges before infecting others. There may be no need for whole population to 
remove critical edges since disease may die out quickly if behavioural changes are effective 
enough.

Figure 28: Compare with “SI link” in different network structure using SIR model 
As knowing that local strategies applied with disease spread can be effective as well in previous 
experiments, we are going to compare it with the “SI link” strategy which is viewed as human 
instinct to reduce contact with infected people and can only be applied if neighbours’ epidemic 
states are revealed. 
Firstly in random network as shown in Figure 28 (a) and (b), “SI link” has similar performance 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      43 
with “High degree” strategy with similar number of total removed edges before 25% remove 
fraction and much more removal than “High degree” from 25% to 40% remove fraction. 
Secondly, in exponential network, “Local Modularity” is as effective as “High degree” and 
“LFM” if remove fraction is less than 30% but removes fewer edges totally. “Similarity” is 
better than “SI link” strategy due to more edge removal. Thirdly, in the scale-free network, “SI 
link” has same performance with “Similarity” by removing fewer edges. “High degree” and 
“LFM” have much better performance than other strategies when remove fraction is 40% by 
only removing fewer than half edges of other strategies. Finally, in community networks 
“Similarity”, “LFM” and “Local Modularity” have similar performance as tested in strategies 
applied globally in section 4.1.2 Figure 21(a), which are much better than “SI link”. Although 
“SI link” tend to perform better with remove fraction increasing, the total removed edges still 
much higher than other three strategies. 
  
(a) Epidemic size (b) Total remove rate 
Figure 29: Compare “Local Modularity” and “SI link” in flight network in local spread model 
Comparing “Local Modularity” with “SI link” in flight network (see Figure 29), we found that 
“SI link” has little lower epidemic size than “Local Modularity” at same remove fraction but 
the total removed edges are much higher. With the growth of remove fraction, “Local 
Modularity” keeps the total removed edges unchanged at last but “SI link” continue to remove 
more edges and even to remove twice edges of “Local Modularity” at 40% remove fraction. 
This is similar with the situation in section 4.1.3 where “Local Modularity” only removes the 
most critical edges while other strategies just remove as much as possible. 
The overall results in this section indicated that strategies applied with disease spreading could 
be as effective as global one but removed much fewer edges. The difference from global 
experiment was that the number of total removed edges first increase and then decrease with 
remove fraction going up, which is because that disease dies out so quickly that only few nodes 
are influenced (In global experiment, all nodes will be influenced no matter there is a disease or 
not). “Local Modularity” was still the best strategy in community network but in other network 
structures it did not perform as well as it in global experiment. Because some of local strategies 
could suddenly die out the disease with remove fraction high enough, which leads to fewer 
nodes infected and thus fewer edges are removed. However, if the remove fraction is too high, 
it means that the disease dies out because infected nodes tend to remove all its edges instead of 
only critical edges are removed. So even some strategies could reach low epidemic size at high 
remove fraction, it does not means that they are as well as those strategies reach same epidemic 
size with lower remove fraction. Like “Local Modularity” and “SI link” in (g), “SI link” 
reaches 20% epidemic size at 40% remove fraction while “Local Modularity” only need 13% 
remove fraction to get same performance. “Local Modularity” was showed much better than 
“SI link” because it removed all critical edges but “SI link” only isolated infected nodes. 
Therefore, according to all above results, we could say that some of local edge remove 
strategies are more effective than “SI link” because they are epidemic status independent and 
focus on critical edges rather than infected nodes.

asymptomatic infectious state and w is the awareness spreading rate. 
By far, we have tried all population become aware based on publicly available information 
when there is a disease (Section 4.2) or there is a belief of disease (Section 4.1). We also have 
tried individual accepts behavioural changes based on local information when disease prevails 
(Section 4.3). Since our local edge removal strategy is epidemic independent and the earlier all 
population becomes aware the better the disease will be controlled, it is worth to try that 
individual takes behavioural changes not only by disease prevalence but also by awareness of 
disease. So in this section, we set all infected nodes become aware and awareness will spread 
simultaneously with disease spread. Once a node becomes aware, it will apply the edge removal 
strategies. In section 4.3, we set that all infected nodes will first apply edge removal strategy 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      45 
and then start infecting other nodes, which may not quite realistic in real life since some of 
infections are asymptomatic. So we add an asymptomatic infectious state in SIR model and 
nodes in this state will not become aware but still be infectious. 
Firstly, the duration of asymptomatic duration is set to be 0, which turns SIIR model into SIR 
model (see Figure 30 (a) and (b)). It can be seen that before the point of 14% remove fraction, 
the faster the awareness spreads the lower the epidemic size will be and the epidemic size tends 
to be as low as that in global test but only removes half edges of global one. There is a large 
different performance between awareness spread and no awareness spread, but once awareness 
spread, high spread speed does not show much better performance and removes same number 
of edges as low spread speed. However, when remove fraction is larger than 14%, epidemic 
size is same for all situations and the strategy of no awareness spread removes fewest edges.  
When duration of asymptomatic infectious is 1 day long as shown in Figure 30 (c) and (d), there 
is a quit large difference in epidemic size between having awareness spread and no awareness 
spread. The epidemic size when there is awareness spread is only half of that in no awareness 
spread and the total removed edges are 2% fewer except when remove fraction is lower than 
14%. As same as (a) there is no much difference in different awareness spread speed. 
From (e) and (f), we can see that the longer the asymptomatic infectious state, the higher the 
epidemic size will be. But if there is an awareness spread, although the asymptomatic infectious 
state is long, it is better than no awareness spread in a short asymptomatic infectious state. 
Because black line and green line remove same number of edges but black line has lower 
epidemic size. When asymptomatic infectious state is 1 day, the awareness spread in 0.3 rate 
leads to three times better performance than no awareness spread and nearly as good as the 
performance in no asymptomatic infectious state. “Local Modularity” performs best in no 
asymptomatic infectious state and no awareness spread for it has the best epidemic control with 
lowest removed edges. 
In summary, “Local Modularity” performed best when infected nodes became aware 
immediately after being infected (asymptomatic infectious state). If nodes could apply remove 
strategies in time before infecting other nodes, there is no need for awareness spreading when 
remove fraction is large enough for “Local Modularity” to find all intercommunity edges. But 
in low remove fraction, higher awareness spread could help to get similar good performance as 
all population applying strategy before disease start with much fewer removed edges, because it 
is applied locally. However, when there is asymptomatic infectious state, the longer the state, 
the worse the disease control will be. Increasing awareness spread speed can help improve the 
performance of epidemic control, but if the asymptomatic infectious state is too long, it will be 
too late to make behavioural changes. 
4.5 Effects of network properties analysis 
To understand the underlying mechanism of these results we test the local edge removal 
strategies on three different network properties: clustering coefficient, power-law degree 
distribution and community strength to see which one has the significant influence to the 
performance of these strategies. 
4.5.1 Clustering coefficient 
We test “Local Modularity” on five exponential networks with different clustering coefficient 
(from 0.1 to 0.5, see Figure 31 (a) and (b)). “Local Modularity” removes similar number of 
edges in different clustering coefficients and the results of epidemic size are also similar in 
small remove fraction less than 30%. From 30% remove fraction to 50% remove fraction, 
although the network with higher clustering coefficient tends to show smaller epidemic size, 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      46 
the ability of epidemic control for “Local Modularity” is not proportional to clustering 
coefficient since it performs better in clustering coefficient value of 0.3 than 0.4. So clustering 
coefficient affect a little to the performance of local edge removal strategies.

(b) Percentage of total removed edges

4.5.2 Degree distribution 
 
(a) Community network, 250/508 high 
betweenness edges 
 
(b) Scale-free network, 250/499 high betweenness 
edges 
Figure 32: Show the percentage of removed edges that are high betweenness edges in different remove 
fractions. Scale-free and community network both with power law degree distribution 
As observed in previous results, “Local Modularity”, “Similarity” and “LFM” prevents disease 
spreading most effectively in community network. Since our generated community network 
has power law degree distribution. We are going to test whether such good result is due to 
community structure or power law degree distribution. Firstly we calculated the 250 highest 
betweenness edges in community network and 250 in scale-free network. Then we record that 
for each strategy at each remove fraction, what percentage of total removed edges are among 
these high betweenness edges. 
From Figure 32 (a) in community network, more than 50% of total removed edges for “Local 
Modularity” and “Similarity” at 12% remove fraction are critical edges compared with about 
20% for “Local Modularity” in scale-free network. With remove fraction growing, this percent 
drops a little first and then increases a lot for “Similarity” and a little for “Local Modularity” 
while for “LFM”, the increase becomes rapidly after 18% remove fraction. The drop is 
because total removed edges increase a lot but the found critical edges only increase a little. 
However, in scale-free network Figure 32 (b), although the rate of critical edges increases with 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      47 
removing fraction, accuracy in it is always smaller than that in community network at each 
remove fraction, especially at low remove fraction. To get the nearly 50% accuracy, the 
strategies in scale-free network needs approximately three times remove fraction more than 
that in community network (for “Similarity”). Therefore, power law degree distribution seems 
help little for local edge removal strategies to find the most critical edges. 
4.5.3 Mixing parameter 
From above results, we may guess that only community structure affect the local edge removal 
strategies mostly. So we vary the mixing parameter which stands for the rate of intercommunity 
edges among all edges to do test. 
  
Figure 33: An illustration of community network before and after applying “Local Modularity” 
  
(a) Epidemic size (b) Percentage of total removed edges 
Figure 34: Local Modularity applied in community networks with different mu 
In order to get 20% epidemic size, the smaller the mixing parameter (mu), the lower the remove 
fraction is needed and also the smaller the total removed edges will be (see Figure 34 (a), (b)). 
This means that high community strength and clear community structure help “Local 
Modularity” to find critical edges at the cost of lower remove fraction and also fewer total 
removed edges. 
On the whole, we found that it was community structure rather than clustering coefficient or 
power law degree distribution that was critical in the performance of local edge removal 
strategies. The higher the community strength, the easier and more accurate would be to find all 
intercommunity edges. Figure 33 shows the community network with mu=0.1 before and after 
applying the “Local Modularity” algorithm when remove fraction is 0.3. It can be found that 
all intercommunity edges have been removed accurately so that epidemic could be kept only 
in one community. 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      48 
5 Discussion 
In this section, we will summarize the observed results and provide our most important 
findings.  
Firstly, we found that it is possible to only use local information to find most critical edges in 
the whole networks. These critical edges were usually the intercommunity edges in the 
networks with community structure or the highest betweenness edges in our study. The local 
edge removal strategies could both slow down the disease spreading and result in much fewer 
infected individuals as well as the global edge removal strategies if the remove fraction for each 
node is large enough, but the total number of removed edges were smaller. One of the 
advantages of local edge removal strategy was that each individual could find its own critical 
edges in the network by only knowing neighbours’ information and it was found fast in 
computing compared with global edge betweenness strategy, which is quite suitable for guiding 
individual’s behavioural changes since that individual is usually not available to whole 
population information and has no ability to conduct complex computing. Another advantage 
was that local edge removal strategies could be applied during epidemic process only by 
infected nodes, which means that only individual in infection area make behavioural changes 
promptly is enough for disease control. Strategies being applied locally could be as effective as 
being applied before epidemic start. Although remove fraction was larger, but the total 
removed edges were much fewer. Based on our review of global strategies in background 
section, we know that global strategy is hard to be applied in real life for the unknown 
topology of network where disease spread and for the huge computational complexity of 
some global strategies (like global edge betweenness) in large network. Also individuals tend 
to remove edges individually in real life. Therefore, it is quite meaningful and practical in real 
life to find such a disease control strategy only using local information. 
Secondly, some local community detection algorithm could be used reversely to find edges of 
each node which were not in its local community. In our testing, we found that “Local 
Modularity” modified from [Clauset 2005] was the most effective algorithm in finding 
intercommunity edges. Because it could find all intercommunity edges in community network 
at the cost of removing small number of total removed edges compared with other local edge 
removal strategies and nearly remove as many edges as global strategy to get the same control 
results. The most important thing was that it will not continue to remove more edges if all 
intercommunity edges have been found even though remove fraction for each node continue to 
increase. “Similarity” and “LFM” also had good delay and control of epidemic in community 
networks although they removed more edges compared to “Local Modularity”. In random 
network, all strategies showed same performance as random removal, which means that it is 
hard to find critical edges in random network since all edges are generated randomly. “LFM” 
and “High degree” were found relatively good in reducing total infected individuals and 
slowing down the epidemic in scale-free network but the advantages were not so distinct. In 
the exponential network, “Similarity” was better than others but also removing relatively 
more edges. “Local Modularity” always removed the fewest edges in all network structure but 
only performed best in community structure, so it is hard to judge its performance in other 
network structures. After all, our results demonstrated that “Local Modularity” was the best 
local edge removal strategy to slow down and control epidemic, especially in the network 
with community structure. 
Thirdly, like the results in paper [Marcelino and Kaiser 2009], our results also showed that 
community structure was important in disease control since network could be separated more 
easily than in other network structures. Additionally, we found that local edge removal 
strategies performed best in network with community structure and the higher the community 
strength, the easier to find intercommunity edges. “Local Modularity” performed well in 
finding intercommunity edges was because of community structure rather than clustering 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      49 
coefficient or power-law degree distribution.  
Fourthly, our local edge removal strategies performed better than the strategy that randomly 
removes edges to infected individuals in all kinds of networks especially community network,  
because we focused on removing most critical edges rather than randomly removal. So 
reducing contact with people in other community was found more helpful than only reducing 
contact with infected people in own community with regard to disease control in a global view 
since communities could be separated by purposive removal. Additionally, from the realistic 
view, it is usually hard to distinguish infected nodes at early epidemic stage, so the strategy 
removes from infected node is less feasible than local edge removal strategy which is 
independent of epidemic status. 
Finally, we did some exploration in awareness spreading, although it was not systematic 
enough, it could be viewed as an inspiration in awareness study for future works. It is known 
that individual’s behavioural changes are the results of awareness of epidemic information. We 
regarded the spread of behavioural changes as a spread of awareness among people, which is 
in a separate way from the disease spread. This kind of awareness could be gained globally 
from publicly information or locally from neighbours. Thus awareness could spread among 
neighbours just like disease. Since local edge removal strategy is independent of disease 
prevalence, it could be applied any time due to being affected by awareness. In our first 
conclusion, we knew that local edge removal strategy applied by infected nodes could be 
equally effective as being applied by all nodes before epidemic start but needed higher remove 
fraction. However, if we allow awareness spreading, we found that locally applying reach a 
similar epidemic size as globally applying at same remove fraction. Although the total removed 
edges were more than no awareness spreading one but were still much smaller than that in 
globally applying. It seems that by allowing awareness spreading, we converted the locally 
applying to a globally applying in a small range area rather than the whole population. Another 
finding about awareness was that when the infected individual cannot make behavioural 
changes promptly before it infected others due to asymptomatic infection, increasing awareness 
spreading rate helped but only limited to small asymptomatic delay. For disease with long 
asymptomatic duration, allowing awareness spreading helped little in disease control unless the 
spreading rate was set to 1. Otherwise, the path of awareness spreading might not be same as 
disease spreading, which means it was too late to make behavioural changes. 
Our current study test different strategies and different remove fractions in different network 
structures using four kinds of disease-behaviour models. It means that we have a large 
number of scenarios to test. Therefore, several simplifications have been conducted and could 
be improved in future studies. Firstly, we run each experiment 150 times on theoretical 
networks and 300 on real network. Since the epidemic start is randomly chosen each time and 
the real network has number of total nodes more than 300, it would be better to repeat more 
times to see the results in flight network. Also for theoretical networks, we only use one 
instance for each theoretical network structure while it would be better to use different 
instances at each run. Secondly, when testing the effect of remove fraction, we choose the 
value of remove fraction roughly. It might be more accurate if we can increase the density of 
testing value, but it will cost much more running time at the same time. 
In conclusion, our results showed that it is possible to guide individual’s behavioural changes 
to slow down and control disease spreading efficiently in network with community structure 
and potentially other networks. The effect of behavioural change to epidemic is worth study 
further since we have observed quite optimistic performances of local edge removal 
strategies. 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      50 
6  Evaluation 
The first objective of this project is to build a disease-behaviour model and simulate it. This 
was completed by designing four types of behavioural change models and three types of 
epidemic models. The models have taken all causes of behavioural changes into consideration 
and allowed different combinations between behaviour and disease models. This objective 
has been archived successfully as the implemented simulation enables all kinds of experiment 
combination by varying test parameters and records all results in txt files for analysis later.  
We also implemented some network generation and rewiring algorithms discussed in methods 
section. Since our project is not aimed at software development, our code is only for doing 
experiment and there is no user interface. But the node and edge were all implemented as 
class so that it could be extended further for other network studies. 
Based on the success complete of first objective, the second objective is to design epidemic 
control strategies related to behavioural changes. We have designed five local edge removal 
strategies according to existing resources and also implement three existing strategies that are 
used as contracts. In order to test their performance, we measured epidemic results, total 
removed edges and proportion of critical edges in removed edges in different network 
structures. Our experiment has showed obvious different epidemic control results for different 
strategies and found that “Local Modularity” had superior performance in disease control. We 
have successfully proofed that it is possible to use local information to detect critical edges. 
All research questions at beginning have been addressed to some level using experiment 
results and some even lead to further research questions (such as the effect of awareness 
spread), which means that we have reached the second objective to find desired strategies 
related to behavioural changes with good control of epidemic. Although the values selected in 
experiments were not intensive enough due to too many combinations, the general trend in 
each plot we got was enough for evaluating strategies’ performance. What we have done was 
to try various possibilities as much as possible and focused on good results to do relatively 
further testing. If we have more times, we could concentrate on the best strategy to do more 
detailed experiment and much further analysis about underlying mechanism. Since we have 
not got the real network dataset that could represent where the disease spread in real life, we 
only used the real global flight network to do experiments. It is better to do test on real life 
network but it is hard to find suitable data which has been discussed in section 2.1.1. 
The third objective is to analysis designed strategies. We have visualized all results data into 
plots and compared them with existing global and local strategies. We also used a lot of plots 
to show how behavioural changes affect disease spread and network structure. For each plot, 
we evaluated the results according to the context and explained each phenomenon considering 
practical significance. So the third objective can be considered success. 
The key contribution of our project is to build a new model to study behavioural changes and 
explore a new direction to help epidemic control (find critical edges locally), which can be 
used not only in epidemic studies but also in network theory studies. 
Behavioural changes and disease propagation in networks 
Yilei Bu, Internet Technologies with Security, 2012                                                      51 
7 Future works 
The good results of local edge removal strategies highlighted the potential further exploitation 
in the study of behavioural changes. 
7.1 Different spreading rate 
For the simplicity, our experiment only set the transmission rate to be calculated under the 
condition when the basic reproduction ratio R0 =3. Since different disease has different 
epidemic parameter. Our project can be extended to study a particular disease or explore the 
distribution under all kinds of epidemic possibilities. It is interesting to see the local edge 
removal strategies’ performance under various circumstances. 
7.2 Rewire the removed edges 
As review in background, many existing studies of behaviour-disease relationships not only 
remove the edges but also add new connections. There are two kinds’ consequences of 
behavioural changes: change parameter and change network structure. We only studied the 
change of edges and have not considered the change of network structure which is usually 
results from rewire behaviour. The rewire can be integrated in local edge removal strategies 
easily by replacing removing to rewire. Studying the effect of local edge removal strategies 
on network structure might be useful in understanding the underlying mechanism. 
7.3 Test on other epidemic networks 
Since the limit of epidemic data source, we only tested the local edge removal strategy in 
theoretical networks, real global flight network and two empirical social networks. It is worth 
being tried in real epidemic network since it is not sure whether the epidemic network has 
community structure or not. Also it is worth finding out whether such local edge removal 
strategies is realistic in real life and whether or to what extent individual will make 
behavioural changes based on such strategies. 
7.4 Awareness spread in different network 
We only study the awareness spread in early stage. It can be extended further like building 
more realistic and advanced awareness spread model and combine it with local edge removal 
strategies. Additionally, the awareness can spread in a different network from where disease 
spreading. Because sometimes individual gets awareness from a virtual network (like internet) 
and actually contacts others in real life social network. The awareness can be gathered from 
virtual network and the local edge removal strategies will be applied in real life network. 
Then the behaviour-disease model will be more complex and thus more dynamic results will 
be observed, which might be quite interesting.
