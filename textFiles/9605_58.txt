Abstract  
 
 
With the rapid development of network technology, many universities have 
established distance education system to meet the needs of students who cannot easily 
attend universities. Distance education includes many different aspects, such as the 
teaching system and examination system, etc. The online examination system is a 
very important aspect.  
 
This thesis for the first time investigates how recommendation algorithm can be 
employed to improve examination systems. This system developed in this project is 
divided two parts, which include real exam and practice exam. In the real exam, the 
teacher sets an exam and student takes part in the exam. In the practice exam, student 
can set an exam and take part in the exam. If the student sets an exam for the first time, 
the system will randomly choose questions for the student. If the student has already 
set the exam, the system will recommend his/her interested questions. In order to 
achieve recommendation, I chose slope one algorithm, which has the best accuracy 
for recommendation. The thesis focuses on the design and implementation of 
recommendation question and the design of a whole system, including system 
analysis, database design, recommendation algorithm and system debugging. This 
system is based on Browse/Server model, using the latest ASP.NET 3.5 framework to 
achieve. It is simple, easy to use and more secure. Compare with the traditional 
examination process, the system has reasonable framework design, which includes six 
modules: authentication, questions bank management, online testing, marking 
management (computer automated marking and manual marking), practice exam and 
score management.

Aims & Objectives 
 
Although distance education has developed vigorously, currently examination method 
is still traditional in most universities, which can be called ãpen-and-paper method?. 
The method includes four elements: question papers designed by teachers, question 
answered by students with pens, marking by hand, and paper analysis. Apparently, the 
traditional method of examination increases the workload of teachers, and is not 
suitable for modern distance education, while online examination system can greatly 
improve work efficiency.  
 
The aim of this project is to develop an Online Examination System based on 
Recommendation algorithm. Teachers will use this system to evaluate each student 
objectively. Students will visit this system through intranet or internet. They will 
follow the instruction from the online system to finish self-test. This system 
developed in this project is divided two parts, which are real exam and practice exam. 
In the real exam, teacher sets an exam and student takes part in the exam. In the 
practice exam, student can set an exam and take part in the exam. If the student is first 
time to set an exam, the system will randomly choose questions for students. If the 
student has already set the exam, the system will recommend his/her interested 
questions. The system can recommend questions to students which are might be 
interested in. 
Objectives: 
1) Develop an online examination system 
2) Make it secure 
3) Automatically generate fair exam paper 
4) Practice module with recommendation system 
5) Test the system

Background & Related technologies 
 
2.1 Software models of internet applications 
There are two main approaches to development of internet applications, which are 
C/S (Client/Server) model and B/S (Browser/Server) model. C/S model needs clients 
to install special client software and operating environment. First, the workload of 
installation is very much. Followed by any computer problems, such as viruses, 
hardware damage, these are required to install or maintain. In addition, as system 
software upgrades, each client needs to re-install. The costs of maintenance and 
upgrade are very high. The advantage of B/S model is that clients do not need to 
maintain, because all clients are browsers. No matter how big the size of the user, it 
will not add any workloads of the maintenance and upgrades. All of the operations are 
only for the server. If it is off-site, we can remote maintenance and upgrades. 
Considering safety and maintenance, B/S model is better than C/S model for the 
proposed application.  
 
 
2.2 Existing online examination 
 
The United States took the lead using the computer technology in education and now 
has entered a mature stage. Web-based platform is used in many famous international 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 9 
computer certificate tests and foreign language tests, such as Microsoft's certification 
exam, Sun Java certification exam, Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) and 
so on. Candidates can apply for the test in the authorized test centers, after 
determining the test of time, candidates can take the test. [14] 
 
Remote test service has also become a quite promising industry. For example, Sylvan 
Prometic in the United States is a professional company for examination service. The 
company sponsors Computer Aided Testing (CAT). Through the network, exam 
questions can be sent to every examination room around the world. The type of exam 
questions provided by the company is multiple choices. Candidates only need to log on 
to its website in advance and then they can take the exam. They will know the results 
of test immediately after the examination. At the same time, the results will be 
immediately sent to the corresponding institutions. Most of certification institutions 
(Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle, etc.) entrust the company to carry out online exam. 
 
In China, distance education also contributes to a number of online exam systems, such 
as remote test system developed by Shanghai Communications University Education 
Centre, common examination system developed by Beijing Jeffrey Co., Ltd, 
PowerExam common examination system developed by Beijing Tianshi Co., Ltd, 
Neoexam online examination system developed by Chengdu Science and Technology 
Development Co., Ltd. and so on.[15] 
 
Most of online examination systems currently use C/S (client / server) model. The 
model requires installing the exam software in both the client side and server side. 
Client side software includes examinations and auto-mark module, responsible for 
displaying the test paper and communicating with the server. Server side software 
includes paper management and test management module, responsible for maintaining 
the question bank, auto-generating paper, collecting the results of exam and statistics 
the results etc. For example, National Computer Rank Examination (NCRE) system in 
China uses C/S model. The model has a great dependence on the client software. It is 
not convenient for system maintenance, and maintenance cost is high. In a word, it is 
not suitable for a large test. 
 
In recent years, with the development of ASP.NET, JSP and other web interactive 
technologies, online examination system based on B/S(browser/server) have become 
more popular. This model uses a database and web technologies. The browser should 
be installed in the system in the client side, but there is no need to install any 
additional software. It can generate questions, mark the paper and collect results 
automatically, while the system is very easy to be maintained and upgraded. 
Candidates just need to login to the system and take the exam through the Internet, no 
longer restricted by geographical area and time. At present, B/S model is used in 
certification exams such as Microsoft's various certification exams. This approach 
meets the needs of modern education, particularly of current mature distance education. 
It represents the future direction of development of examination systems. Modern 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 10 
online education mainly uses Web-based commercial course management software 
such as WebCT (e.g. used by University of central Lancashire) and Blackboard (e.g. 
used by University of Bristol).  
 
The organization of the online examination will be divided into three types: 
1) Full open: this type is used for self-assessment of student. It is open, so 
everyone can access to the system. Normally, the teacher does not need to 
monitor the exam, and the test can be taken at any time and any place. Students 
can get results of test immediately after the test. Generally, it is free.  
2) Semi-open: this type is used for certification exam, such as CCNA and NCRE 
that I mention before. Candidates should apply for exam and are required to 
take the test in designated examination room. In semi-open mode, arrangement 
of the exam is relatively free. Candidates can select any exam in required 
time-range. Normally, there are a number of teachers responsible for 
monitoring the exam; candidates need to pay fees for exams. For example, 
CCNA examination fee is 120 pounds.  
3) Closed type: this type is used for exams in enterprises or universities. 
Candidates must take the exam in required time and place, and there are a 
number of teachers responsible for monitoring the exam.  
 
The above three types of online exams only use browsers, and exam software no 
longer needed. All the information and test results are saved on the server. 
 
 
2.3  Microsoft SQL Server database technology 
 
Microsoft SQL Server 2005 is a relational database management system with high 
performance. As a member of Windows database family, SQL Server relational 
database management system can meet all types of enterprise customers? requirements. 
[11] According to customer's demand, SQL Server 2005 has significantly improved in 
scalability, usability and manageability. [11]  
 
SQL Server 2005 uses client/server (C/S) model. All workloads are decomposed into 
the server and client. The client application is responsible for Business Logic Layer 
and provides data to users. [11] Generally, it run in one or more client machines and 
also can run on the server. Server is responsible for the management and allocation of 
the available resources, such as memory, network bandwidth and disk I/O 
(input/output) etc. 
 
SQL Server 2005 is a part of Relation Database Management System (RDBMS). It is 
responsible for managing the database structure, which mainly include the 
maintenance of the relationship between the data in the database so as to ensure the 
data accuracy and recovery of all data once the system fails.

2.3.1 Features and functions of Microsoft SQL 
Server 2005 
 
SQL Server 2005 extends the performance, reliability and accessibility based-on 
previous version (SQL Server 7.0). [12] 
SQL Server 2005 has the following new features: [12]  
1) Support Extensible Markup Language (XML). SQL Server 2005 allows the use 
of XML to configure the system and exchange data. Developer can use XML to 
insert, update and delete data. 
 
2) Safely access the database by web browser. SQL Server 2005 provides a 
browser through the firewall security to access the data. 
 
3) Scalability. In order to improve the scalability and manageability of a large table, 
SQL Server 2005 allows using partitions in data warehouse. [13]The partition 
will help to reduce query time, improve load time and maintainability of the 
database. As the tables become very large, partitioning can divide tables into 
smaller. Thereby, it improves maintainability of the database. If we have 
multiple CPU in PC with a large table, the partition of the table can achieve 
better performance by parallel operations. 
 
4) Maximum uptime and reliability. It allows keeping the database online status in 
database maintenance. SQL Server 2005 enables fast backup, and sends the log 
file to the database maintenance plan. 
 
 
2.4  Genetic algorithms for setting fair test paper 
 
2.4.1 Principles of setting test paper  
 
A piece of test paper is not a random combination of questions. Many people think 
that the process of paper-making includes: to collect a large number of questions, to 
put them into question bank, and to classify them, then randomly select questions to 
compose a piece of paper. However, such process cannot generate exam paper with 
balanced difficulty [16]. The real purpose of developing online examination system 
is to generate objective and scientific papers [17]. To achieve the goal, the following 
four principles should be stressed. 
1) Principle for goals: Each course should include teaching objectives. The 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 12 
examination is a method for achieving teaching objectives. It can measure 
learning effect of students and test whether teaching objectives are achieved.  
 
2) Principle for all sidedness: the paper should include all knowledge points. 
When it is established, the question bank should cover all knowledge points. 
Each of knowledge points should be covered by the corresponding test 
questions, and there should be different types of questions in the same point. 
 
3) Principle for significance: The test paper should highlight the most important 
part of the course and the essence of knowledge. 
 
4) Quantitative principle: In the process of generating test paper, questions should 
be strictly allocated in accordance with the teaching requirements. In addition, 
the difficulty of test questions should be suited to the level of candidates. 
 
 
2.4.2 Constraints of setting test paper  
 
Questions should be designed according to inherent characteristic parameters, which 
are called constraint. By establishing the constraint, the system can generate exam 
paper module. There are seven following type of constraints [17]: 
1) Types of questions: multiple choice, true-false, fill in blank, short answer, etc. 
2) Respective chapters: Questions should be corresponding to the chapters of the 
course in the questions bank.  
3) Knowledge points: The specific exam questions should include the knowledge 
points. 
4) Difficulty coefficient: Difficulty coefficient is calculated by following method. 
Let the difficulty of j
th
 question be pj: 
For subjective question, the difficulty coefficient is: 
jj
N
i
ij
j
w

student at 
the j

question. The jx

 denotes the average score of j
th 
question. The jw  
denotes the values of j

For Objective question, the difficulty coefficient is: 
N

j ??1  
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 13 
The N denotes the total of candidates. The jn  denotes the number of student 
who correct answers the j
th 
question. 
The value range of pj: [0-0.4] hard, [0.4-0.7] medium, [0.7-1] easy. 
5) Teaching requirement: It includes memory, understanding, simple application 
and integrated application. 
6) Score: the test score of the student is determined by the number of correct 
answers, exam time and item difficulty.  
7) Utilization ratio: it refers how many times a question has been selected by the 
system. Out of considering fairness, the system should control the utilization 
ratio during the generating exam paper.  
 
 
2.4.3 Automatic generation test papers  
 
Automatic generation of test paper means to select questions from the Question Bank 
and to compose a paper according to user conditions and algorithm. Thereby, the 
selection of algorithm is important, which determines whether maximized fairness is 
satisfied for every student.  
To achieve the automatic generation of test paper, there are three methods:  
a. Randomizing. [6] Randomly picking questions with some parameters is a usual 
method to make a test paper. This process repeats until the test paper generation 
is completed or one cannot select questions from the Question Bank to meet the 
constraints.  
 
b. Backtracking.[7] ÒBacktracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) 
solutions to some computational problem, that incrementally builds candidates 
to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate c("backtracks") as soon as 
it determines that c cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.Ó 
(Wikipedia Backtracking) Backtracking uses the Depth-First-Search algorithm. 
It is suitable for small Question Bank in online examination system. 
 
c. Genetic algorithm.[8] Genetic algorithm is proposed by Professor J. Holland in 
1975. It is a computation module which simulates Darwinian biological 
evolution. It is a method of searching for optimal solution by simulation natural 
evolutionary process. It is suitable for generating test paper in online 
examination system. This system used genetic algorithm to generate fair test 
paper. It is satisfied with intelligent, high quality and high speed to generate test 
paper. Finally, it is suitable for large-scale online exams. 
 
 
2.4.4 Summary of genetic algorithm 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 14 
 
Biological evolution is an optimized process. It can produce prefect species by 
environmental selection and holmatogenesis. Genetic algorithm is also an optimized 
algorithm which is inspired by the idea of biological evolution. The concept of genetic 
algorithm was firstly proposed by Bagley J.D in 1967. Professor J.H. Holland in the 
University of Michigan made a pioneering research on the theory and method of the 
genetic algorithm in 1975. In recent years, genetic algorithm has been widely used in 
pattern recognition, neural networks, image processing, machine learning, industrial 
optimal control, adaptive control, biological sciences, social sciences and other 
aspects. [8] 
The basic idea of Genetic algorithm is based on Darwin?s theory of evolution and 
Mendel?s theory of heredity.  
 
The important principle of Darwin?s theory of evolution is survival of the fittest. He 
thought that every species would be more and more suitable for living environment. 
The basic features of each species are inherited to its offspring, but some changes 
would take place in gene of the offspring, which is called mutation in genetics.  
 
The important principle of Mendel?s theory of heredity is gene genetic. He thought 
that heredity exists in cells in the form of the genetic code, and in the chromosome in 
the form of genetic gene. Each gene has a special place and controls a particular 
character. Gene mutation and gene hybridization can make offspring to adapt to 
environment better. After natural elimination, highly adaptive gene can survive. 
 
According to theory of evolution and theory of heredity, the following concepts will 
be used: [8] [18] [19] 
1) String: In genetic algorithm, there is a binary string and it is correspond with 
chromosome in genetics. 
2) Population: a set of individuals of Chromosome with characteristics are called 
the population. 
3) Gene: gene is an element of string and it represents the characteristics of 
individual.  
4) Gene Position: It means a place where gene is located. Gene position is 
calculated from left to right by string. 
5) Evolution: In the process of biological survival, the species gradually adapt to 
environment, so biological quality is constantly improved. This process is 
called evolution.  
6) Fitness: fitness represents adaptive level of an individual. In the study of the 
genetic and evolutionary biology, the biologists use the term (fitness) to 
measure the adaptive level of a species in the environment. High fitness of the 
species will get more chance to breed, but low fitness of species will gradually 
die out.

2.4.5 Structure of genetic algorithm 
 
The basic structure of the genetic algorithm is shown in Figure 1.  
1) Set generation k=0 and produce initial population 
2) Calculate the fitness of each individual in initial population 
3) Randomly select two individuals from initial population, and make a mutation 
operation with two individuals, then get a new generation, let k=k+1 
4) If the terminal condition is satisfied, then the algorithm is terminated; 
otherwise, go back (2).

2.5  Recommendation system 
 
Recommendation system uses statistics, artificial intelligence and data mining 
techniques to analyze behavior of visitors. It can generate recommendations to help 
users access product information in which they are interested. It can guide the user's 
buying behavior and create substantial profits for users. To recommend exam 
questions for each student, I used this technique in practice part of my online exam 
system.  
 
 
2.5.1 Main recommendation algorithms 
 
The recommendation algorithm is the core and the most critical part in the 
recommendation system. It largely determines the performance of recommendation 
system. Currently, the main recommendation methods include: content-based 
recommendation, collaborative filtering, association rule-based recommendation, 
utility-based recommendation, knowledge-based recommendation and hybrid 
recommendation. The collaborative filtering algorithm is particularly widely used and 
there are user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering. As 
for user-based or item-based collaborative filtering, there are two data acquisition 
method which are implicit method and explicit method. Explicit method needs user 
input some information, such as rating the product. Implicit method does not require 
users to input evaluation data, but the system makes evaluation for users according to 
the behavioral characteristics of the users.  
 
 
2.5.2 Content-based Recommendation 
 
Content-based recommendation is a continuation of the information retrieval 
technology [4]. ÒInformation retrieval is the science of searching for document, as 
well as that of searching relational database and the World Wide Web.Ó (Wikipedia 
information retrieval) Content-based recommendation method recommended products 
based-on the content information without the user's evaluation of the items. It needs to 
use machine learning approach to get user?s interest information from the content. For 
example, I have chosen a book Data Mining, Second Edition: Practical Machine 
Learning Tools and Techniques, Second Edition (Kindle Edition) in Amazon.com. 
The Amazon.com system recommended some books are following:  
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 17 
 
Figure4 Amazon.com system recommend books (source:www.amazon.com ) 
 
In content-based recommendation system, the item or object is defined through the 
relevant case feature. The system calculates the match-level between users? data and 
the predicted items for current user. The user data model depends on the learning 
method, commonly used with decision trees, neural networks and vector-based 
methods. Content-based users? information needs the users? historical data. User data 
model may change with the users? preferences. 
 
The advantages of content-based recommendation method are as follows [5]:   
 
1) It does not require other users of the data. No cold-start problems and data sparsity 
problems. ÒCold-start is a potential problem in computer-based information systems 
which involve a degree of automated data modeling. Specifically, it concerns the 
issue that the system cannot draw an inferences for users or items about which it 
has not yet gathered sufficient information.Ó(From Wikipedia).  ÒÓ 
2) It can recommend for users with special interests.  
3) It can recommend new items. 
4) It can recommend the project by listing the contents of characteristics, which can 
explain why those items are recommended.  
 
The disadvantages of content-based recommendation method are following:  
1) It requires that the content should be easily extracted into a meaningful feature 
and that the characteristics of content should have a good structure.  
2) It cannot explicitly get information about other users? judgment. 
 
 
2.5.3 Collaborative Filtering Recommendation 
 
ÒCollaborative filtering (CF) is the process of filtering for information or patterns 
using techniques involving collaboration among multiple agents, viewpoints, data 
sources, etc.Ó (From Wikipedia collaborative filtering) It generally uses the nearest 
neighbor technique, by using the user?s historical information, to compute the 
similarity between the users. Then system uses the neighbor users? evaluation of 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 18 
products (examination questions) to predict the target user's preference. According to 
this preference, systems can recommend products (e.g. examination questions) for 
users [1][5]. An advantage of the collaborative filtering is no special requirements for 
recommended object. It can deal with unstructured complex object, such as music and 
movies. 
 
Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that: A user can find the interested 
content of the product through finding similar interests among other users. Then 
system recommends these products (examination questions) for the users. This idea is 
very easy to be understood. In daily life, we often carry out some options according to 
a good friend?s recommendation. Collaborative filtering exactly used this idea in 
recommendation system, so this is a process of multi-user ÒcollaborativeÓ to filter 
items. 
 
Collaborative filtering recommendation system recommends automatically products 
from the perspective of the user. That is, a user acquires recommendations from 
buying mode of other users. Users do not need to search for recommendation 
information to suit their interests, such as filling out survey forms. 
 
Compared to content-based filtering method, collaborative filtering recommendation 
system has the following advantages [5]: 
1) It can filter some information which is difficult to be filtered by automatic 
content analysis of machine, such as art and music.  
2) It can share the experience of other users. It avoids the incomplete or 
inaccurate content analysis. Besides, it can filter complex or elusive 
concept, such as information quality and personal taste.  
3) It can recommend new information. Compared to the content-based 
filtering recommendation system, the content-based filtering 
recommendation system recommends products which are familiar with the 
contents of the user, but collaborative filtering recommendation system 
can find potential interests of the users.  
4) It can effectively use other similar user?s feedback and accelerate 
individual learning.  
 
Although collaborative filtering recommendation system is significant as a typical 
application, there are still many problems to be solved. The most typical problems are 
sparsity and scalability.

2.5.4 User-based Collaborative Filtering 
 
Collaborative filtering is also classified user-based collaborative filtering and 
item-based collaborative filtering. To build a user-based collaborative filtering system 
typically requires three steps.  
 
Step one. We need to collect information that can represent the users? interest. The 
traditional way commonly uses scoring system. The most famous example is 
MovieLens.org.  
  
Figure 5 customer reviews & ratings (source:www.argos.co.uk) 
Some website often appears "reviews and ratings". (Figure 5) 
 
This approach is called "explicit score" method. It has an obvious disadvantage that 
data collection is difficult. Users often do not want to waste time to make the task for 
the website. In the actual business systems, even using this method, it will be 
packaged as a more user-friendly style. There is a more effective method that is 
"implicit score" method. This method does not require users to input evaluation data, 
but the system makes evaluation for users according to the behavioral characteristics 
of the users.  
 
Step two. We need to search nearest neighbor. The starting point of collaborative 
filtering is finding your interest in the same group of users. The terminology is called 
"nearest neighbor". The core of nearest neighbor search is computing the similarity of 
two users. For example, there are user A and user B. The system needs to obtain the 
score of all items of user A and user B. Then system selects an appropriate algorithm 
to calculate similarity. Based on score data, system calculates the similarity value of 
user A and user B. Currently, there are some algorithms including Person Correlation 
Coefficient, Cosine-based Similarity and Adjusted Cosine Similarity. The details of 
these algorithms will be discussed in next section. From figure 6, they used data from 
MovieLens recommender system. There are over 43000 users who have expressed 
opinions on 3500+ different movies [1]. The following is formula of mean absolute 
error:  
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 20 
  
The r denotes real rating by user. The P denotes prediction rating by the algorithm 
calculated. The U denotes users.  
 
The accuracy of adjusted cosine similarity algorithm is better. Usually, we will be 
based on different data sets to select a different algorithm. 
 
Figure 6 Relative performances of different similarity measures, Figure 
from: ref [1] 
 
Step three. We need to generate a recommendation result. With the nearest neighbor 
set, we can predict the interests of target user and generate the results of 
recommendations. Usually, according to the purpose of the recommendations, there 
are different kinds of recommendation. The most commonly recommendation method 
is Top-N recommendation and associated recommendation. 
 
Here?s Top-N list is different from the ÒhottestÓ list. Hot list is generated based on the 
full data set. It is the same for each person. Top-N recommendation is generated for a 
single user. It is not the same for each person. Through users? nearest neighbor 
statistics, select the highest frequency items and these items are not in users? rating as 
a recommendation results.  
 
As the number of user increases, the amount of calculation of user-based collaborative 
filtering algorithm is increased linearly. Its performance will be worse and worse. For 
Web applications, one of the most important factors that affect the user is the speed of 
response, which hinders the user-based collaborative filtering technology to be used in 
the actual system. In general, Amazon.com uses Item-based collaborative filtering 
technology. Along with Amazon's success, Item-based method is also much more 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 21 
popular. 
 
 
2.5.4.1 Pearson Correlation Coefficient with 
recommendation system 
 
Pearson correlation coefficient is used to measure the similarity between the two data 
sets. [1] For example, in a film information website, many users are likely to rate one 
of the film. Pearson correlation coefficients can be used to help the user to find similar 
interests, thus the related recommendation is made. The basic idea of this 
recommendation is that if A, B share similar interest, thus B will probably like the 
favorite movie of A. Therefore, we can recommend favorite movie of A to B. 
Pearson correlation coefficient formula is as follows:

X, Y means a person, which is vector. N is amount of items. 
 
Suppose that the film library has three films, both audience A and audience B make 
score on these films (6 is the highest). A's score was [1, 2, 3]; B's score was [2, 5, 6]. 
Then the Pearson correlation coefficient of A and B was 0.9608, indicating that the 
interest of the two persons is very similar. 
 
 
 
 
2.5.4.2 Cosine-based Similarity  
 
User rating can be seen as the n-dimensional space. If the user has not rated the item, 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 22 
the item?s score will be set to 0.The similarity between users can be calculated as the 
cosine of the angle between these two vectors. Let item?s rating of user X and user Y 
in the n-dimensional space be expressed as a vector X
?
,Y
?
. Thus the similarity (sim (X, 
Y)) of user X and user Y is:[1]

The Ò Ómeans the dot-product of the two vectors.Ó [1] 
 
 
2.5.4.3 Adjusted Cosine Similarity 
 
In the cosine-based similarity, the metric issue of different user scoring does not be 
taken into account. By subtracting the average of user?s score, adjusted cosine 
similarity improves these shortcomings [1]. Let Iij be collaborative items? rating of 
user i and user j. Ii and Ij are items? rating of user i and user j. Thus the similarity (sim 
(i, j)) between user i and user j is: 
  
Ri,c denotes user i rating on the item c. iR denotes the average rating of user i. jR
denotes the average rating of user j.  
   
2.5.4.4 Generate recommendation 
 
Through the above similarity measure, we can get the nearest neighbor of target user. 
The next step will generate the appropriate recommendation. This method can predict 
the items? score which user has not rated, and then select the top results of the 
predicted scores as a recommendation back to the current user. Let NNu be the nearest 
neighbor set of user u. Let Pu,i  be the user u rating for the item i. We can calculate 
Pu,i as follows: 
 
sim (u, n) denotes the similarity of user u between user n. Rn,i means user n rating for 
item i. uR denotes the average rating of user u. nR denotes the average rating of user 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 23 
n.  
 
 
2.5.5 Item-based collaborative filtering 
 
Item-based collaborative filtering is popularized by Amazon.com (users who buy x 
also buy y). Under the context of rating-based collaborative filtering, it was firstly 
proposed by Vucetic and Obradovic in 2000 [2], and it proceeds in an item-centric 
manner:  
1) Build an item-item matrix determining relationships between pairs of items 
2) Using the matrix, and the data on the current user, infer his taste 
 
Item-based collaborative filtering is based on the assumption: If most users in some 
items the scores were similar, the current user's score on these items are also quite 
similar. Item-based collaborative filtering system uses statistical techniques to find the 
nearest neighbor of target item. [1] Thereby, we can predict the target item score of 
the current user according to the score of nearest neighbor. This assumption is 
consistent with our daily life. Basically, people like bread and they also like milk.  
Just like the user-based method, Item-based method requires three steps:  
1) System needs to collect rating data of users. 
2) System needs to search for items of nearest neighbor and calculate the similarity 
of the items. (The user-based method calculates the similarity of the users) 
3) System needs to generate result of recommendation. 
 
Compared with the user-based methods, Item-based method has improved the 
scalability of collaborative filtering. In user-based method, with the increase of 
number of users, the amount of calculation increases linearly. Item-based method 
calculates the similarity between items instead of the similarity between users. For the 
item concerned, the similarities between items are more stable. It can complete 
off-line calculation of the similarity, thus it greatly reduces the online calculation and 
improves efficiency of recommendation. 
 
For both of content-based and item-based collaborative filtering, there is no verdict 
for which one is optimal. Since different algorithms to deal with different data were 
very different. However, there is a great difference using these two algorithms in the 
concrete realization. That is produced two different approaches, which including 
online calculations and offline calculations. That is, User-based collaborative filtering 
algorithm generated recommendations which are online computation, and item-based 
collaborative filtering algorithm can pre-process a lot of data before generating 
recommendations, then it can reduce the system pressure. 
 
For both content-based and item-based collaborative filtering, there is no clear 
conclusion that which one is better, since algorithms to deal with different data are 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 24 
very different. There are two different approaches, including online calculations and 
offline calculations. User-based collaborative filtering algorithm generates 
recommendations by online computation, while item-based collaborative filtering 
algorithm can process a lot of data before generating recommendations (offline), 
therefore it can reduce the load of the system. 
 
 
2.5.6 Slope one algorithm 
 
Slope one algorithm is proposed by Daniel Lemire in 2005. It is belong to family of 
item-based collaborative filtering. It aimed to achieve five goals [21], which 
including: 
 
1) Easy to implement and maintain: The engineer can easily interpret all 
aggregated data and the algorithms should be easy to implement. 
2) Updated on the run-time: Add a new rating items, it should be an immediate 
impacted on the predicted results. 
3) Efficient query response: query should be faster but it may need to pay the 
cost of space. 
4) Expect little from first visitors: For a score item of a few users, they should 
get a valid recommendation. 
5) Reasonable accuracy: the recommended items should be accuracy within 
reason.  
 
ÒSlope one algorithms work on the intuitive principle of a ãpopularity differential? 
between items for users. In order to measure this differential, the simple way is to 
minus the average rating of the two items. In turn, this difference can be used to 
predict another user?s rating of one of those items, given their rating of the other. Ó [21] 
For example: look at figure 2.5.6. 
 
 
Figure 2.5.6 Example of slope one (source: [21]) 
 
User A gave a rating 1 for item I and 1.5 for item J.  
User B gave a rating 2 for item I, so how many rating does User B gave for item J? 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 25 
User A likes item J more than item I by 0.5. We assume user B will also like item J 
more than item I by 0.5. So we predict the rating of item J is 2.5. Therefore, the 
answer is 2.5. (2 + (1.5 - 1) / 1 = 2.5). 
Here we can see that an advantage of the Slope One algorithm is that user can get a 
relatively accurate recommendation in a few data, which can be solved Cold Start 
problem. 
However, for realistic application, we need using weight slope one. Since different 
weight will predict different values. Consider following example: 
 
Customer  Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 
John 5 3 2 
Mark  3 4 Didn?t rate it 
Lucy  Didn?t rate it 2 5 
 
First, we need to calculate the average difference of item 1 to item 2, which was  
( (5-3) + (3-4) ) / 2 = 0.5. The average difference of item 1 to item 3 was 5-2 = 3. 
Then we predicted the rating of Lucy for item 1 using her rating for item 2. We got 2 
+ 0.5 = 2.5. In a similar way, we predicted the rating of Lucy for item 1 using her 
rating for item 3. We got 5 + 3 = 8. So we got two predictions rating of Lucy for item 
1. We can?t just choose one of them. Hence, we should use weight slope one. ÒIf a 
user rated several items, the predictions are simply combined using a weighted 
average where a good choice for the weight is the number of users having rated both 
items.Ó [22] In the example, we would predict the following rating for Lucy on item 1: 
( 2 * 2.5 + 1 * 8 ) / (2+1) = 4.33.  
Hence, the formula for weight slope one is: 
  
Notation [21]:  
i,j means item i and item j. ui is the rating of this user gives to item i. The S(u) means 
the subset of the set of items consisting of all those items which are rated in u. The 
number of items in a set S is card(S). The set Si(X) is the set of all ratings from a user 
u ? X such that they contain item i (i ? S(u)). dev means the average deviation of 
item I with respect to item j. so the formula of dev is:

2.5.7 Comparison of recommendation algorithm 
 
The following experiment data is from [23]. They have compared to the accuracy of 
three recommendation algorithms based on MAE (Mean Absolute Error), which are 
user-based collaborative filtering algorithm, item-based collaborative filtering 
algorithm and slope one algorithm.  
 
Number of items Number of users Number of ratings Sparsity / %

Using dataset form the table 2.4.7-1, we can see, with the number of items increases, 
each algorithm's MAE values become larger, actual prediction accuracy will be worse. 
Slope One algorithm is the best prediction accuracy.

Using dataset from table 2.4.7-2, we can see, as the number of users increases, besides 
Item based algorithm, the prediction will be much accurate. Slope One algorithm still 
is the best prediction accuracy.

module, online examination module and management module. In the login module, a 
user who has an account number can directly login the system. Alternatively, a user 
can register an account number then login the system.  
 
As the special requirements of online examination system, making data security and 
confidentiality is very important. Confidentiality refers to the user all the information 
online should be security. Security refers to the user to participate in an event should 
be a safe process. For example, encrypt the exam paper. Although hacker can 
intercept the test paper, they haven?t got the key to decrypt it. In order to ensure its 
security and confidentiality, we should ensure that candidates are not cheating. 
Second, we must strictly control the examinations time. 
 
In the practice exams module, all users (students) can add questions for practice 
exams. A very interesting research question is to how to select the best questions 
among those created by the users. This could be done on the basis of difficulty, 
explicit feedback and implicit feedback. Based on difficulty, that could be estimated 
from the fraction of users answering them. Based on explicit feedback, that could be 
marks of users for the questions. Based on implicit feedback, that could be used by 
recommendation system. The recommendation system can make questions which 
these questions are suitable for current user (student). Well known example of 
recommendation system is the system used by Amazon.com. In Amazon.com, as user 
bought a book, the system can recommend user buy analogous books. This module is 
to help students revising. 
 
In management module, administrators (teachers) will set question: choice question, 
true-false, essay question, manage students and check the exam scores. Teachers will 
modify each candidate?s information and add or delete candidates. Also they will add, 
modify, or delete exam papers. 
 
In online examination module, students will answer questions set by the teacher. The 
system will automatically generate a random test paper. The questions will be 
generated from the database (this questions are different from practice exams 
module?s questions). In order to prevent candidates repeatedly refresh the papers 
(webpage) and make sure that the duration of the examination is recorded correctly, I 
designed anti-refresh function and the examination process cannot be closed, 
otherwise the exam results of the candidates will not normally be saved into the 
database. After candidates submit their papers, the system will automatically check 
the answer. Then candidates will be provided with a feedback on the correct answer 
and their scores.

3.2 System development tools & platforms 
 
System platform is divided into client and server side. Due to I used browser/server 
(B/S) model approach to development of internet applications, so the client side will 
support Windows NT, Mac OS and Linux. As long as a user has a browser, he or she 
can use this online examination system. For clients, this is an independent system 
platform. 
 
Server side used windows 2000, which is based on NT technology. It has many of 
advantages, including a good safety, stable running and easy managed.  
 
My system is based on ASP.NET and SQLServer2005 development, which will 
eventually run on Web-server. I used following development tools, including Visual 
Studio.Net 2008, Macromedia Dreamweaver MX, Adobe Photoshop CS, and SQL 
Server 2005. 
 
There are a lot of techniques to implement server-side programming. Such as JSP, 
ASP, PHP, ASP.NET. I used the current popular network programming techniques, 
which is ASP.NET platform supports the programming language C# as the primary 
means for achieving (in conjunction with JavaScript, VBScript, HTML, etc.). The 
efficiency of ASP.NET (as a web implementation technology) is very high. It meets 
the requirement of real-time examination system. 
 
I am using Asp.net because it is a web application framework and builds on the 
common language runtime (CLR). It uses the server side to build powerful web 
applications. Compared with traditional dynamic pages technologies, the program 
design of Asp.net is relatively simplified and its structure is clear. However, the cost 
is that the page design is more difficult and the interface needs to be handled. It is 
difficult to use the other tools. Asp.net separates program from interface. In other 
words, Asp.net makes web applications like traditional windows applications. The 
designer has easy jobs. He can look at Datagrid / Datalist / calendar / Repeater and 
other web controls. You will find that these well-designed reusable controls greatly 
improve the efficiency of programming. Dreamweaver is a powerful and efficient tool 
for web page designer. I think asp.net is a major reform for programmers. It makes the 
large web applications much easier and in accordance with modern software 
engineering. In this point, web applications can be seen as the distributed expansion 
of the traditional C# structure.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 31 
3.3 Database design 
 
My system used Microsoft SQL Server 2005 database, which is a high performance 
relational database management system. I built several tables which including 
candidate information table, questions table, exam paper table, user answer table, 
student?s score table and so on.  
 
 
Figure 3.3-0 relationship of each table 
 
In the relationship of each table, using UserID connected Users table, Score table and 
UserAnswer table together. Hence, using UserID can find the student?s score and 
his/her answer sheet. The Role table shown different user has different duty. It used 
RoleId connect to Users table, so we can find a user?s role in the system. Due to the 
page limit, I just show single choice question in the relationship of each table. Using 
CourseID connected Course table, Paper table and question table. Hence, we can find 
paper information through CourseID and PaperID.  
 
Each table details are following:

The left side of paper table is recorded paper name, id and paper state. The right side 
of paper table is recorded more details. The PaperID of right side table is a foreign 
key for table 1, which means both of paper tables are connected. The TitleID of right 
side table is a foreign key for question table. Hence, the question table and paper table 
are also connected.

recommendation questions.

3.3.1 Using stored procedures in database 
 
ÒA stored procedure is a subroutine available to applications accessing a relational 
database system. Stored procedures are actually stored in the database data 
dictionary.Ó[24]. User can execute the stored procedures by the procedures name and 
parameters. Using SQL statements to write a stored procedure has the following 
advantages [25]: 
 
1) Before running the stored procedure, the database parsing was carried out, 
which can improve the execution performance of SQL statements. That is 
why to execute stored procedure is faster than normal SQL statements.  
 
2) Stored procedure can guarantee the security of data. Stored procedure 
declined the user access if the user does not have permission.  
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 34 
 
In order to improve the operating efficiency of the server, my system also use a 
variety of database stored procedures. For example, to add a user in database: 
 
Figure 3.3.1 Add user stored procedure 
 
 
3.4 System security design 
 
The security of online examination system is vital for the candidates. Good security is 
basic conditions to ensure a fair examination. The system will not be widely used 
without good security design. To ensure system security and confidentiality, I mainly 
achieved through the following: 
 
1) All candidates who access to the system must be authenticated while registering 
their computer IP address. To prevent cheating, the system forbids two or more 
candidates using the same account to login. In addition, system only lets 
candidates login once. (Under special circumstances, for example, her or his 
computer crashed, to remove this restriction by the administrator) 
 
2) In order to ensure stability of the system, system should verify the users whether 
exceed the maximum login size restrictions. Therefore, we need to set the 
maximum number of login restrictions. Over the limit, the system will forbid the 
follow-up user login. After entering the system, if the user does not make any 
action within the specified time, his/her all operations will be cancelled, and the 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 35 
user must re-login if he/she wants. At the same time, the system login 
authentication mechanism not only achieves the user authentication, but also be 
able to intercept the user input a URL address in a browser, and prevent users to 
enter the URL address without login. This design can prevent illegal system 
entry. 
 
3) System can assign different operations permissions to different users. System can 
forbid users viewing all examination papers (except current paper) and copy the 
paper. 
 
 
3.4.1 Prevent cheating 
 
The security requirement of online examination system is very strict. The system 
forbids two or more candidates using the same account to login. Hence, candidates 
can be avoided using a user name and password to login by multiple IP addresses at 
the same time. This is called Single Sign On (SSO). It can effectively prevent 
cheating.  
 
To achieve SSO, it mainly uses Cache object. Cache object is usually used for caching 
Web applications. Basically, I saved the login information of candidates into Cache 
object and set the expired time of Cache being the same as Session?s expired time. 
Hence, once the Session is expired, the Cache is also expired. Since the Cache object 
has already stored login information of a candidate, if the candidate logins twice or 
more, the system will refuse him/her. 
 
In addition, to prevent that candidates using internet to search the answer or use copy, 
paste and refresh to affect exam, the ctrl, shift, F5 on the keyboard must be shielded 
and disconnect the outer net during the exam.  
 
 
3.4.2 Prevent skipping login interface 
 
Login screen is the first security barrier in my system. The illegal user (hacker) may 
enter a URL address and directly go into a page. After that, hacker may steal the user 
registration information and exam paper information. In order to prevent such 
situation, I have established the identity of an authentication session object to 
determine the legality of the user login. If someone skips the login page, the system 
will prompt an error message and return to the login page. For example, a candidate 
normally logins, then set the state of Session as true: 
Session (ÒstudentÓ) = true; 
 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 36 
If the candidate hasn?t login, system will set the state of Session as false and redirect 
to login page.  
If (Session (ÒstudentÓ) == false) 
{ 
 Response.redirect (login.aspx) 
} 
 
 
3.4.3 Prevent SQL injection attack 
 
The SQL injection attack is an attempt by a attacker to insert SQL command into the 
Web form and deceive the server to execute malicious commands. For example, in the 
login screen, if I write the code to verify user?s name and password like this: select * 
from UserTable where username="&user&" and password="&pwd&"", and a hacker 
input the username as Ò1 or 1=1Ó and password as the same with username, the code 
will change to: select * from UserTable where username=1 or 1=1 and password=1 
or 1=1. The system will pass this verification and hacker can access the system 
without real username and password. Therefore, I defined a function to filter special 
character. 
 
pulic string Consql (stringistring) 
{ 
istring=istring.Trim(); 
istirng=String.RePlace(ÒorÓ, ÒÓ); 
istring=istring.RePlaee(ÒandÓ, ÒÓ); 
istring=istrillg.RePlaee(Ò!Ó, ÒÓ); 
istring=istring.RePlace(Ò+Ó, ÒÓ); 
istring=istring.RePlaee(Ò?Ó, ÒÓ); 
returnistring; 
 } 
 
 
3.4.4 IIS security configuration 
 
My system used Internet Information Server (IIS). Using IIS to build sever is very 
convenient and easy. It has become one of the most popular Web server software. IIS 
relates to exam paper questions information and user information, therefore the 
security of IIS is particularly important. I have designed the following methods to 
enhance security of IIS. 
 
1) Remove unnecessary virtual directory 
After installing the IIS, the system generates default directory in root direcroty, 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 37 
including IISHelp, IISAdmin, IISSamples and MSADC. These directories are 
useless. They are therefore deleted directly 
 
2) Remove the risk of IIS components 
After installing the IIS, some of IIS components may lead to security threats, 
such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service and Network News 
Transport Protocol (NNTP) Service. If we do not use the components, we should 
remove them as much as possible 
 
3) Classify IIS files and Set permissions for each file 
According to different types of directory, appropriate permissions should be 
assigned. For example, static file folders (HTML file) allow to read, refuse to 
write. ASP.NET scripts folders allow implementation, refuse to write and read. 
EXE and other executable program allow implementation, refuse to read and 
write. 
 
4) Remove unnecessary application mapping 
There are many applications mapping in the default IIS configuration. In addition 
to ASP.NET mapping, other mappings are rarely used. We should remove 
useless mapping using the "Internet Services ManagerÓ. 
 
5) Protect the log security 
The log is an important part of strategy to improve overall system security. By 
default, the IIS log is saved at %WinDir%\System32\LogFiles. The hacker 
should know the path, so I need to change a path and change the access 
permissions in which only administrator can access the log file.  
 
Through the above security settings, we can enhance the security of server.

System implementation and key technology 
 
4.1 Public class 
 
In the project, I created several classes to package some common methods or 
functions. These classes not only improve the reuse of code, but also to facilitate code 
management. SQL Server 2005 is a large relational database system. In ASP.NET, I 
used ADO.NET technology to access SQL Server. The following is several classes of 
ADO.NET for accessing the SQL Server: 
 
SqlConnection: this class is used for establishing the connection to SQL Server, which 
open database connection. 
SqlCommand: this class is used for executing the SQL statement or stored procedure. 
SqlDataAdapter: this class is used for padding the dataset or update database. 
SqlDataReader: this class is used for reading data from database. 
SqlParameter: this class is used for transmitting parameters to store procedure. 
 
I created a database class, which including following functions: 
The Open () function is used for connecting to the database and open the connection. 
The Close () function is used for disconnecting to the database and close the 
connection.  
The GetRecord(string XSqlString) function is used for getting query resulting from 
database.  
The RunProc(string ProcName) function is used for executing a stored procedure.  
The RunProc(string ProcName, SqlParameter[] Params) function is used for 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 39 
executing a stored procedure with a parameter of the stored procedure. 
The GetDataSet(string ProcName) is used for executing a stored procedure and 
svaing the result into a dataset. 
 
 
4.2 Login module implementation 
 
To prevent the illegal system access, login module can verify the legitimacy of the 
user. A user must enter his/her username and password. In order to enhance security, 
this system used verification code technology. The system can prevent the robot 
program to login system repeatedly through the randomly generated verification code. 
Users enter a user name and password, click "Login" button to log on. In the process, 
the system verifies the username, password and verification code. According to the 
identity of the user, system will show different page to user.  
 
 
Figure 4.2 Login module 
 
Login module used following control component: 
TextBox: text box component for user input text. 
Button: the ãLogin? button submits the username, password and verification code to 
server.  
RequiredFieldValidator: this component checks whether the text box is null. If the 
user hasn?t entered username or password, it will show error message.  
Verification code: this component creates four digital numbers randomly and 
generates a figure. It can prevent hacker using robot program to login system 
repeatedly.  
The flow char of login module is as follows:

4.3 Register module implementation 
 
In the real exam, only the teacher can register a user to a student. In the practice exam, 
student can register a user for exercises. Student should enter his/her ID, name, 
password, and choose department. To prevent student using the same ID to register, 
the system can check the ID in the database. If the same ID is found, the system will 
show an error message. After that, system saved all student information into the 
database.

4.4 User management 
 
To take part in the real exam, student needs a user id and password, which need 
teacher to add a new user for a student (Figure 4.4-1). The teacher also can modify 
and delete the user. If the student forgot his/her password, teach can reset his/her 
password and send a new password to the student (Figure 4.4-2).

4.5 Management of question bank 
 
After a teacher logins the system, he can manage the question bank, including to add 
question into the database and to modify the question information. There are five 
types of question in this system: single choice, multiple choices, true-false, 
fill-in-blank and essay questions. The teacher should choose exam course name and 
enter question title, answer of each selection and correct answer. The correct answer is 
used for automatic marking paper. For example: add single choice question (Figure 
4.5-1). 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 43 
 
Figure 4.5-1 Add single choice questions into the database 
 
Teacher can manage the question. Click ãDetails? of each question, they can modify 
question information. Click ãDelete? for deleting the question. The following figure is 
management of single choice question.

4.6 Automatically generate test paper based on 
genetic algorithm 
 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 44 
Genetic algorithm generally uses a simple code to represent complex structures, 
which uses binary string with fixed-length to encode. A solution of the question 
corresponds to a binary string of length k. Start from the initial population, calculate 
the fitness of each individual in current population, use crossover and mutation to 
produce the next generation of population. In this way, a new generation is made 
continuously until the terminal condition is satisfied.  
 
Figure 4.6-1, genetic algorithm diagram of generating papers. [18] 
 
Specific steps of setting test paper are as follows: 
Start 
Set parameters of genetic algorithm 
Set parameters of constraints 
Initial population of paper 
Generate paper 
Finish 
Iterations add one 
Selection, Crossover, Mutation 
Generate a new paper population

Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 45 
 
1) Using binary string coding to represent questions 
The length of coding is decided by the number of questions in question bank. 
Assuming the question bank has m questions X1, X2, X3ÉÉXm, the questions of test 
paper are selected from X1, X2, X3ÉÉXm. If Xi (i=1, 2, 3 É m) = 1, the question is 
selected. If Xi (i=1, 2, 3 É m) = 0, the question is not selected. For example, assuming 
a test paper includes 10 questions, there are ten ã1? in X1, X2, X3ÉÉXm. therefore a 
piece of paper can represent a binary string of ã010110110101110É000?. 
 
2) Initial population 
In order to make the system keep equal opportunities in the initial search for each 
population, we usually generate a string population by random initialization. In string 
population, length of string is the same. The size of initial population is usually 
decided from the specific problems, or given by experience or experiment [20]. When 
system generates test paper, the size of population would be set n. Each individual 
randomly selects questions by function of random (m).ãm? is the number of Questions 
in question bank. 
Initialization process is as follows: 
for i=1 to population_size do 
random (m)  
end 
 
3) Calculate the fitness of each individual in current population 
To calculate the fitness of each individual, a function of fitness is required. In this 
report, the function of fitness is:  
 
i = 1, 2, 3Én.   ki>0 
The ei denotes the error of i
th 
paper. The ki denotes weight coefficient. If the error of 
test paper of individual constraints is small, the value of fitness is greater, which 
means the individual (question) is close to targets of test paper. 
 
4) Selection 
 
ÒSelection is the stage of a genetic algorithm in which individual genomes are chosen 
from a population for later breeding (recombination or crossover).Ó (Wikipedia 
Selection genetic algorithm). The purpose of selection is to select good individuals 
from the current population, so that they have the opportunity to breed the next 
generation. Selection is guided by the principle of ãsurvival of the fittest?. 
 
Generally, we use ãRoulette wheel selection? (figure 3) to choose individual from a 
population. The roulette wheel selection is similar to gambling of roulette. According 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 46 
to the individual fitness, roulette size is divided into different proportion of the area. 
Individuals with high fitness occupy a large proportion of the roulette wheel, the 
probability that individuals are selected is larger.  
 
Figure 4.6-2 Rulette wheel selection 
Source: http://www.edc.ncl.ac.uk/highlight/rhjanuary2007g02.php/ 
 
5) Crossover 
ÒCrossover used to vary the programming of a chromosome or chromosomes from 
one generation to the next. It is analogous to reproduction and biological crossover.Ó 
(Wikipedia Crossover genetic algorithm). First, two individuals are randomly selected 
from population, and then a crossover point is randomly selected. For example, there 
are two individuals A1 and A2. The crossover point is randomly selected by 7. The 
length of string is 10.  
A1 = 1000011111 
A2 = 1111111011 
After crossover, got new A1? and A2?: 
A1'?1000011011 
A2'?1111111111 
 
6) Mutation 
The operation of mutation changes the value of the string from 0 to 1, or from 1 to 0. 
However, not all the bits can be changed. The probability of mutation of each bit is Pm. 
Pm is specified a value which is between 0 and 1. In each bit of string, the mutation is 
independent. That is, one mutation does not affect another mutation. The effect of 
mutation is to introduce new genetic material. For example, if the value of a string is 0, 
the crossover can never produce the value of 1. Only by mutation, the value of string 
can change.  
 
7) Termination 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 47 
Genetic algorithm is a kind of iterative search process. This process is repeated until a 
termination condition has been reached. There are two kinds of methods of 
termination. The first method sets fixed number of iteration. At the beginning, the 
number should be small, such as 100 times. Then according to the situation (e.g. the 
constraints are not sufficiently satisfied) gradually increase, can reach thousands of 
times. Then the number of iteration can gradually increase, even reach thousands of 
times. The second method is that termination is decided by fitness of individual. Once 
the fitness of individual does not change or changes little, the process of iteration will 
be terminated. I combined the above two methods in my project.  
 
 
4.7 Using Slope One Algorithm to Recommend 
Questions 
 
In the section 2.5.6, we introduced some conception of slope one algorithm, now I 
want to introduce how to implement slope one algorithm in my system.  
Basically, Using slope one algorithm need following data: 
1) Some several users 
2) Some several questions 
3) Some users? rating of questions  
 
Slope one algorithm to solve the problem that is recommends questions which haven?t 
rated to users according to some several ratings.  
To implement slope one recommendation system, we need following steps: 
1) Loading the user?s rating from database and save the rating in memory 
2) Calculated rating difference of any two questions 
3) Input user?s several rating of question, system predicts the possible rating of 
the rest questions. 
4) Sorting the prediction, and show the Top Questions. 
 
Step one: Loading the user?s rating from database. Assume there are three users and 
four questions. User rating for each question is following:  
 
Ratings User1 User2 User3 
Question 1 5 4 4 
Question 2 4 5 4 
Question 3 4 3 N/A 
Question 4 N/A 5 5 
 
I need to calculate the rating difference of any two questions. So I got the following 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 48 
matrix: 
 
 
Item1 Item2 Item3 Item4 
Item1 N/A 0/3 2/2 -2/2 
Item2 0/3 N/A 2/2 -1/2 
Item3 -2/2 -2/2 N/A -2/1 
Item4 2/2 1/2 2/1 N/A 
 
Considering the weight slope one, I need to record the number of users having rated 
both items. Firstly, I defined a class to store rating (c#): 
 
 
Secondly, I used ÒDictionaryÓ (C# Generic collection) to store the rating difference 
(the matrix).  
 
 
 
The Dictionary generic class provides a mapping from a set of keys to a set of values. 
Each addition to the dictionary consists of a value and its associated key. Retrieving a 
value by using its key is very fast, close to O (1), because the Dictionary class is 
implemented as a hash table. [26] 
 
Thirdly, I need to predict the possible rating of the rest questions, it need two steps.  
1) I wrote a class called SlopeOne.  
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 49 
 
I need instantiation the RatingDifferenceCollection (_DiffMarix) to store the rating 
difference (the matrix), and then declared HashSet to store the number of questions. 
The function of AddUserRating can accept a record of user?s rating. There are double 
loop in the AddUserRating function. Surrounding loop traverses all rating of questions, 
inner-loop traverses again and calculates the rating difference of a pair of questions. 
Since I used weight slope one, I need calculate the weight. In program, I used Freq 
plus 1 if these pair of questions appears once. The following code is from inner-loop: 
 
 
 
After every users called the function of AddUserRating, the system built a matrix, but 
my matrix is a table format.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 50 
  Rating Difference Freq 
Item1-2 0 3 
Item1-3 1 2 
Item2-1 0 3 
Item2-3 1 2 
Item3-1 -1 2 
Item3-2 -1 2 
Item1-4 -1 2 
Item2-4 -0.5 2 
Item3-4 -2 1 
Item4-1 1 2 
Item4-2 0.5 2 
Item4-3 2 1 
 
2) Input a user?s rating, predict the rating of the rest of questions: 
 
In function of Predict, there are also double loop. Surrounding loop traverses all rating 
of questions in the HashSet, and inner-loop traverses current user?s ratings which 
from the parameter. Using this user?s rating and the matrix, system can calculate the 
rating of the rest of questions:  
 
Observing the matrix, we can see the value of diagonal in the matrix never has a value 
and the value of below the diagonal is symmetrical with the value of above the 
diagonal. The value of below the diagonal is equal the value of above the diagonal 
multiplied -1. Hence, I add Ò(itemId < inputItemId) ? 1 : -1)Ó to save the store space.  
 
Finally, sort the prediction, and show the Top Questions to users.

Testing 
 
5.1 System function testing 
 
The function testing belongs to black-box testing. It is used for detecting errors of 
each function of system. Normally, black-box testing is used mainly in order to find 
the following types of errors: [27]  
1) Whether the function is incorrect or missing. 
2) Whether the data structure is incorrect or external information (e.g. data files) 
accessed error. 
3) Whether the performance is satisfied requirements. 
4) Whether the Initialization or termination is incorrect. 
 
In testing, the system looks like a closed black-box. Without considering the internal 
structure of the system, we test the system interface. It checks the function of system 
whether is in accordance with the specification. It also checks the system whether 
receive input data to generate the correct output data. Black-box testing focuses on the 
external structure of system and don?t consider the internal structure.  
 
Using the black-box testing has following advantages:  
It is simple. Tester does not need to understand the system code and how to 
implementation.  
From the user point of view, tester can easily know the user will be used function of 
Yuzhe Xu   MSc in Advanced computing internet technologies with security 52 
the system and also know the possible encountered problem.

Conclusions & further work 
This thesis for the first time investigates how recommendation algorithm can be 
employed to improve examination systems. This thesis firstly introduced various 
kinds of existing online exam systems and software development models. Secondly, it 
introduced some algorithms for generating exam paper and some algorithms for 
recommendation questions. Through the comparison of recommendation algorithm, I 
chose the slope one algorithm to implement online exam system. 
 
This system used B/S software model to development. Database used SQL Server 
2005 and development environment used Visual Studio 2008, which can be made the 
system more quickly respond. This system developed in this project is divided two 
parts, which are real exam and practice exam. In the real exam, teacher sets an exam 
and student takes part in the exam. In the practice exam, student can set an exam and 
take part in the exam. If the student is first time to set an exam, the system will 
randomly choose questions for students. If the student has already set the exam, the 
system will recommend his/her interested questions. In the same time, I used a variety 
of security policies to ensure the security of the system. 
 
Finally, I tested the system by the black-box testing. According to the testing result, it 
is found that the system is stable, and achieves objectives of the proposal. The system 
supports different courses, different kinds of questions and successfully generates 
exam paper or recommendation questions.  
 
However, in the actual operation, some shortcoming s have grdually arisen in the 
system. Thest shortcoming s include: 
 
1) The exam questions presented only in the form of plain text. I will continue my 
research and make it possible for the system to show languages and images in the 
form of multimedia.  
2) I need to strengthen the function of score statistics and the function of papers 
analysis in the future work. 
3) This system cannot mark essay question automatically. In the future work, I will 
apply artificial intelligence technology to achieve making essay question.
