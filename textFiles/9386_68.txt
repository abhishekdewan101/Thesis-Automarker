Designing Fast and Small adder using Jackson and Talwar approach

Summary:    
This dissertation undertakes the analysis of the Jackson and Talwar?s approach for 
designing adder. The project includes designing a low valency parallel prefix adder based 
on Jackson and Talwar?s approach of factorisation. Jackson and Talwar?s approach is a 
generalisation of Ling?s Theory of factorisation. It evaluates approach for designing a fast 
and a small adder by reducing the fan-out in a design and calculating the delay caused by 
the logic gates. It locates and examines the lacunae present in Jackson and Talwar?s 
approach and analyses the design of a fast and small adder by reducing the complexity in 
the R(reduced group) and thus making D (not kill) group much more complicated. It 
further looks at implementing the Sparse carry tree technique for better performance in an 
adder. Sparse tree method reduces the fan-out of the logic gates and so the delay in a 
circuit. The current adders touches the Ling?s theory of factorisation for reducing the 
complexity in the logic but Jackson and Talwar have the better tendency to reduce the 
complexities of the terms to a depth by manipulating the equations while designing adders. 
This thesis reveals the ways in which Jackson and Talwar?s approach can be utilised in 
different ways in an adder and also it reflects the benefits of using sparse trees in 
conjunction with Jackson and Talwar?s approach resulting in small and fast adders. This 
dissertation seeks to provide a richer context for the evaluation of Jackson and Talwar?s 
approach for designing an adder than Ling?s theory, and in doing so proposes new ways of 
looking at the perspective.  Furthermore it verifies that sparse carry tree is a good method 
to be implemented in designing. 
? I have designed three 16-bit parallel prefix adder using different logics. 
? The practical implementation of the theory given by Jackson and Talwar for 
designing novel adders is done. Further analysing novel designs to fill in the gap 
between Jackson and Talwar approach and designing in CMOS VLSI.  
? Comparison using Sparse carry tree is done in two designs for analysing these 
adders to give better performance in terms of area and speed.

1 Introduction: 
Addition of two binary numbers is a critical operation underlying digital microelectronics. 
It is desirable to have an adder with good performance and area trade off characteristics as 
adders are responsible for cycle time in processors. There are various types of adders such 
as carry - skip adder, conditional - sum adder, carry look - ahead adder, carry select adder 
and hybrid adders. Selection of an adder structure involves diverse choice of algorithm as 
well as its own advantages and disadvantages. Various adders are designed for achieving 
different targets like high speed, less area and low power. For almost all the adders, the 
logic can be divided into two types namely Carry logic and Sum logic. Implementation of 
these logic can be basically done by employing prefix operators such as MUX, the AND-
OR gates etc. Each type of prefix operators design provides different prospects of their 
implementations. Parallel prefix adders serve with excellent performance in binary 
additions carried out in VLSI.  
Parallel prefix adders use simple logic cells to maintain various tradeoffs like fan out, 
quantity of cells used and the amount of logic levels implemented, and also balance the 
connection within logic cells. This is the most widely used adder as it performs the 
functions in parallel thus reducing the delays. In adders, with an increase in the width of 
the gates, the delay is increased, thus requiring more time to propagate or generate a carry 
from MSB to LSB. Hence, parallel prefix adders modularise large logic gates into fast and 
smaller adder implementations. 
Ling in 1981, proposed a new carry recurrence to reduce the logical depth for carry 
computation in carry look-ahead structures. The algorithm introduced by Ling factored out 
the Цnot kill? bit from the Generate function which reduced the logical depth. It further 
reduced the complexity only at the first level whereas the complexity of all other levels 
remained same. The Цnot kill? term was produced with the generate term only at the end 
level which reduced delay. 
 In High Speed Binary Addition 2004, Jackson and Talwar focused on constructing the 
carry based on Ling?s approach. They investigated the families of adders that can be 
derived from the reduced generate and hyper propagate functions which are a 
generalization of the Ling?s pseudo carry. Their successful approach was not only to take 
out the Цnot kill? bit from the last stage but from all other stages as well.  
Priti Patil in 2008 showed that Ling factorisation can be applied to all the stages in carry 
computation while constructing an adder. This factorisation reduces the complexity of the 
critical path thus reducing the delay and making it faster. However the adder designed is 
not smaller and I situate my research in this critical gap. 
Adder is a topic of significant importance and since ages substantial research has been 
performed on it. However, enough scope for innovating novel concepts in designing of an 
adder still exist. The undertaken project involves comparatively less amount of logic levels 
and thereby reducing the delay in adder implementation, hence providing an adder which 
is fast in speed and smaller in area as compared to the conventional models. The obtained 
designs are implemented with Sparse carry tree logic which reduces the amount of logic 
cells in a circuit. Sparse tree is a novel method. Hence its usage needs to be justified in 
adder implementation methods. This project provides a base for the justification of Sparse 
carry tree by proving its verification for the usage in designing an adder.

Speed of an adder is an important parameter for estimating the delay in a circuit. The 
technique used in this project for evaluation of delay in critical path is Logical effort. 
Logical effort delay model is a design methodology for estimating the total number of 
CMOS stages required to implement logic function and to calculate delay. Logical method 
is the simplest and the most accurate VLSI area model for prefix adders implemented in 
CMOS. It is a measure of the worst performance for the output current of any logic gate in 
comparison to an inverter. This comparison in gates is viable only when same capacitance 
is applied across their input. Logical effort can also be defined as the slope achieved by 
dividing delay v/s fan-out of logic gate to the inverter. 
To justify that the novel adder is smaller, the total number of gates in a complete design of 
novel parallel prefix adder are individually compared with the total number of gates in 
latest conventional 16-bit Ladner-Fischer Parallel prefix adder. The length of a gate is 
equal to the width of these Polysilicon gates and the area covering these gates vertically is 
known as polysilicon grids. So the count of the polysilicon grid defines the size of a gate. 
For comparison, the logic gates in a design are multiplied with their polysilicon grids 
present in a logic cell. A tabulated comparison of the total number of gate size in a design 
reflects the overall size of an adder which is further compared with the total count of 
polysilicon grids (size) of Conventional 16-bit Ladner-Fischer Parallel prefix adder. 
The thesis is categorised in many chapters. Chapter 2 in this thesis discusses the 
background of the entire project. Initialising from the concepts of adder, equations and 
notations used in parallel prefix adder till conventional adder used. This chapter also talks 
about all the gates used in VLSI, techniques used for evaluating size and speed of the 
designs made. Ling making fast adders, the history supporting his achievement, various 
papers published regarding Ling?s theory, holds a strong base for this chapter. 
Chapter 3 is shows the work done for this project. It starts with the research methodology 
given for Jackson and Talwar?s approach which is itself derived from Jackson and Talwar 
Published paper, reason for doing was this to give a more grounded explanation of what 
theory is all about. Further chapter 3 depicts all novel designs for 16- bit J & T adders 
followed by the calculations done for evaluating their speed and size. 
Chapter 4 tabulates the result and gives explanation of experimented results. 
Chapter 5 is doing the critical evaluation of the work done by explaining the choices made, 
instead what other choices could have been opted , were the choices for made in this 
ongoing project, was worth . Chapter does not only appraise the choices made but it also 
explains the reasons of not taking other options even if they are considered. 
Chapter 6 speaks about the conclusions observed after gaining results. Also it suggests the 
future work that can conclude this project on a better platform.

1.1 Aim: 
The primary aim of the project was to design a novel adder which is Faster and Smaller by 
implementing R. Jackson and Sunil Talwar approach presented in a paper published рHigh 
speed binary additionс (R.C.Jackson and S. Talwar, Nov 2003). Secondly the project seeks 
to provide new avenues for researching and experimentation in Jackson and Talwar?s 
approach, providing new insights to designing adders in VLSI using CMOS methodology 
and comparing it for better results than Ling?s theory (H.Ling, 1981). Finally the project 
proposes a new design methodology of an adder in CMOS. 
1.2 Objectives: 
1. Understanding the basic equations for parallel prefix adder, theory of Ling 
factorisation and Jackson and Talwar?s approach: 
The initial task was to understand the concepts of parallel prefix adder in order to 
correlate the terms with the notations used in Ling?s theory. Also in-depth study of 
Ling?s theory of factorisation was aimed which provides a base for Jackson and 
Talwar theory. The understanding and forming a base for Jackson and Talwar?s 
approach was difficult as the paper High speed binary addition do not materialise 
any good knowledge about this approach. 
 
2. Designing an adder using Jackson and Talwar?s approach: 
Various configurations of parallel prefix adders (Knowles, April 1999) are 
considered for designing adders. The more complicated Jackson and Talwar?s 
approach is the more flexibility it provides for designing. Schematics of adder 
designs are given for low valency. Manipulation of equations is to be done for 
using only valency -2 and valency -3 input gates.  
 
1. Proving that Jackson and Talwar?s approach is more beneficial to use than Ling?s 
theory. Different critical paths in a design are considered and then logical effort 
delay model (Sutherland,Sproull, Harris, 1999) is applied on different path for 
calculating delay.  
 
2. Using different novel methods like Sparse carry tree (Harris, 2010) in the adders. 
Merging Sparse carry tree with Jackson and Talwar?s approach for reducing the 
area of an adder. Implementation of above mentioned adder with Sparse carry tree 
and without Sparse carry tree is done then tabulated results are compared.

2 Background: 
 
2.1 Concept of Adders: 
Addition of two numbers is the fundamental operation underlying digital microelectronic 
circuits. It is desirable to have an adder with good performance and area trade-off 
characteristics. Adder should be designed in a way that it computes results fast also it 
should be small to occupy less chip area. An adder is used to add to binary numbers in 
digital devices. Generally, all adders work by considering 2?s complement. Adders are 
desired to give good performance in efficiency , speed  and small  chip area as these are 
the  most required parameters ,so a mutual understanding technology along with the 
algorithm  is needed for  its  implementation Prefix formulations of adders gives 
transparent  way of using, thus the adders following these formulations can be efficient and 
covers less chip area. 
 
Basically while designing adders we are concerned with Sum and Carry logic. The sum 
logic is calculated by considering the carry from every single bit from LSB to MSB 
.Similarly for carry logic, best approach is, implementing carry from the least significant 
bit in order to propagate it to all other bits as the most significant bit allows maximum 
carry sharing. The mentioned approach is known as Layered approach (Neil H.E Weste 
and David Harris, 2005) (Y.Wang and K.K Parhi, 2010) in which the subgroups of carries 
i.e excluding  one  carry generated  from most significant bit allows maximum  carry 
sharing in at different bit positions. In this process the last bit get becomes lot more 
complicated in the carry incorporation path. All the logic discussed above is implemented 
using NAND and NOR?s gates in VLSI technology as it saves more logic gates and 
thereby reducing the delay of the circuit. 
 
An adder should be constructed with less number for logic cells in order to reduce the 
delay and the capacitance in the circuit .The properties like delay, capacitance, fan-in and 
fan-out are used to check the performance in an adder. A full adder cell can be 
implemented in many different logic structures .The properties like fan-in and fanпout 
completely depend on the type of implementation technology or he logic structure used for 
designing the basic operator and the type of prefix operator in an adder. Also, the 
combination of the amount of internal wiring and fan-out of intermediate nodes can give 
an incredible output of small and fast adders. 
 
An adder (Burgess N. , 2009) is used to add to binary numbers in digital devices. Based on  
different  algorithms and methodology various adder designs are build for achieving 
different targets  of high speed or less area consumption. Adders are basically divided into 
two types (Neil H.E Weste and David Harris, 2005), depending upon the number of inputs 
and the outputs we have: 
1) Half Adder 
2) Full adder 
 
1) Half Adder:  This is suitable for single bit addition. For single bit addition, an 
adder has two inputs(a and b) and the output obtained is the sum of two bits, in 
terms of Sum and Carry. In a half adder, addition of two bits is done without any 
carry in implementation.  
The truth table is used for better explanation. In this the carry propagates from one 
column to other column on moving from LSB to MSB.

Table 1 : truth table for Half adder 
Half adder is the basic design of any functional digital logic design which is formed by 
two logic gates 
 
Figure 2 : logic gate circuit for Half adder 
 
The sum is simply an XOR and the carry is an OR gate so we use two gates to implement 
this half adder logic:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
? S = X  ?  Y 
? Cout =  A  . B 
 
2) Full adder:  It is a logic circuit implementing three bit binary number. Full adder 
is designed by joining the two half adders in a way that the sum (output ) of one 
half bit adder is given as input to the other half adder. In full adder there are two 
carries so we take one as CIN and the other as COUT and we also have the third input 
as S to designate the final two bit number output as Sum and carry-in.  
 
The notations used for output in Full adder are usually expressed in terms of Generate, 
Propagate and kill.                                                                                                             
?Kill = when both the processes are zeroes.                                                                         
?Propagate = when the Cin is a Cout .                                                                              
?Generate = when both the functions are 0 or 1. 
 
The carry propagates to others with the MSB generating a carry and all other carries are 
sub groups .The Sum and Carry are expressed as:  
? S = XY?Z?  + X?YZ? +X?Y?Z +XYZ 
S  = (X ? Y) ? Z 
? Cout = XY  + XZ + YZ 
= XY + Z( X+ Z ) 
= ( X?Y? + Z?(X?+Y?))? 
= maj (X,Y,Z) 
The resulting truth table is shown:

Table 2: Truth table for Full adder 
We can implement the logic for Sum (S) by using 3 п bit XOR gate made up of 3- bit 
majority function. 
 
                                    
Figure 3: Logic circuit for Full adder 
In order to perform multi bit addition the total number of bit to be added should be equal to 
the total number of adder to get the output with proper carry and sum bit logic. In the 
above circuit we are using three levels of logic so the carry out delay will be equal to 3 
gate delays. The carry gate uses factorization and is called a majority gate. 
 
2.2 Different type of N- bit adders: 
The simplest type of adder used for the additon of two bits or the simplest method used for 
designig a full adder is Ripple adder (R.E. Ladner and M.J. Fischer, 1980).Other adders 
types are Ladner- Fischer , kogge-stone, brent-kung ,knowles, Han carlson . These above 
mentioned adders are based on he theory of parallel prefix adder. With the research carried 
out in the paper of Family of adders (Knowles S. , April 1999), Ladner пFischer (R.E. 
Ladner and M.J. Fischer, 1980)and  Kogge п stone (P.M. Kogge and H.S. Stone, 1973) 
methods are considered the best option. Priti?s thesis (Patil, 2007) examines  Ladner п
Fischer against Kogge п stone where Ladner пFischer  came out to be faster in terms of 
delay and fan-out than Kogge п stone. This being the reason , Ladner пFischer   is taken as 
the base adder for undertaken project work. Brief explanation of different relevant types of 
adder is given . 
 
2.2.1 Ripple Adder: 
The Ripple carry adder (Lin, 2003)is the simplest method for adding two binary digits but 
it is slow in performance as the carry bit transferred has to cover all the logic levels  for 
incorporating the value of  sum . In Ripple adder the sum is computed only after carry 
from the previous bit is transferred to next bit for which the sum has to wait inducing the 
delay in the circuit, sum is computed after it receives all the three input . As discussed full 
adder has one input as the carry bit of the previous bit which slows down the process for 
calculating sum. The carry bit Cout from generated of Цi? bit position serves as an input Cin

to the Цi+1? bit  .These type of adders in which the carry bit ripples from one bit to other is 
known as ripple carry adder .Ripple carry adders generates only one bit at a time. If only 
the carry bit from the Цi? bit is generated it will be the input to  the Цi+1? bit and then that 
bit will generate carry , this whole process of waiting for the carry introduces  propagation 
and generation delay.  
 
Figure 4 shows 4 bit Ripple carry adder (google webpage, 2010) 
As shown in the above diagram the output carry from the previous bit is given as the input 
carry to the next bit and this process of rippling the carry takes long time which introduces 
delay in the circuit and making the method slow. 
 
2.2.2 Adders designed on the basis of generated carry: 
Variety of adders which can be used as the base model for designing an adder such as 
carry skip adder, carry look ahead adder, parallel prefix adder etc but generally the adder 
designs   are dependent on the carry groups that is generated from the previous bits and 
then the logic obtained for the carry group is implemented using different NOR and 
NAND gates to suffice the carry out for the recent bit. Depending on whether the carry is 
generated, not kill or propagated the application of the gates is done. In these kind of 
adders, with the increasing bits, the logic becomes more and more complicated which is 
intense to realise with the simple gates. These kinds of adders are tough to realise reason 
being that for every single bit there is some logic applied. Sometimes in the concern of 
realising the logic, makes its application difficult. These kinds of adders have various 
CMOS gates with different valency.  Depending on carry if it is propagated or generated or 
kill here are some examples of the carry expressions: 
C5 = G4:0 = g4 + p4g3 + p4:3 g2 +p4:2 g 1 + p 4:1g0 + Cin p4:0      
Similarly for other bits: 
C4 = G3:0 = g3 + ~k3g2 + ~k3:2 g1 +~k3:1 g 0 + Cin ~k3:0 
C3= G2:0 = g2 + ~k2g1 + ~k2:1 g0 + Cin ~k2:0 
C2= G1:0 = g1 + ~k1g0 + Cin ~k1:0 
C1= G0:0 = g0+ Cin ~k0 
C0= Cin . 
The Generalisation (A. B. Smitth and C.C.Lim, 2001) of the above terms is given as : 
Ci = gi-1              
   
     
   
   
)     Equation 1: summation of carry terms 
The not kill term (~k) is often represented as propagated term(p)  as well as the usage of 
not kill logic can be implemented using a basic NOR gate instead of using the high delay

EXOR gate .As discussed above these terms lot more complicated towards MSB this being 
the these higher complicated  terms are subdivided into smaller groups which compute the 
terms based on the basic  ЦX term? and ЦY term ? . The realisation of the basic terms makes 
it simple to implement the logic in the higher bits. The carry obtained above are used to 
constructing the sum bit in every single bit as the carry propagates, so while designing this 
kind of adders it is very important to combine every single carry bit from LSB to 
MSB.The expressions to evaluate the value of Group generate, group propagate and not 
kill term is calculated from the truth table (Patil, 2007) given below: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 3: truth table for carry chain

? Propagate : X= 0  ;Y =1;  Cin = Cout = C 
? Propagate : X= 1  ;Y=0;   Cin = Cout = C 
? Pi  = Xi  ?  Yi                                                        Equation 3:propagate terms 
 
? Generate  : X= 1  ;Y=1;   Cin = don?t care;  Cout = 1 
? Gi  =  Xi  . Yi                                              Equation 4 : generate terms 
 
 
The calculation for carry bit generated and carry bit propagated terms in a 4 пbit adder 
should be considered in this way: 
C3 = G2:0 = g2 + g1p2 + g0p1p2 + Cin p0p1p2 
Then C2 = g1 + g0p1 + Cin p0p1 
C1 = g0 + Cin p0 
C0 = Cin  
Where g0 = generate at bit position 0 and similarly we have g1, g2 generate at bit position 1 
and 2.  p2, p1, p0 = propagate at bit position 2, 1 and 0. 
   These kind of adder constructed are often faster because every bit have a different logic 
and the logic is mathematically supported to construct the simplest logic for every single 
bit .In these kind of adder the second stage computes the carry which forms a carry tree as 
it takes sequentially the carry from all other bits from LSB and thus forming a carry tree.

2.3 Carry Look-Ahead Adder: 
The CLA (Yu-Ting Pai and Yu-Kumg Chen, 2004) (Y.Wang and K.K Parhi, 2010) 
(google webpage)is a complex method then Ripple carry adder. It is widely used because 
of its high performance and over exceeding factor of reducing the time span by generating 
and propagating the carry simultaneously unlike Ripple carry adder. It increases the speed 
by reducing the amount of time required in generating carry groups from most significant 
bit to the least significant bit. The procedure includes generation and propagation of carry 
alongside of the calculation of sum bit. Carry Look Ahead adder does not wait for previous 
bit to generate carry and then after generate, propagate carry in the next cycle rather it 
performs both the function for carry together so that the propagation and generation delay 
is reduced. 
 
CLA is widely used in designs because of its parallel processing of carries for n-bit 
additions of high valency cells resulting in less delay. It sends the divided input in groups 
of  kпbit  and evaluates different signals for generation or propagation of a carry groups  . 
It derives different signals from different groups ,at same time, to increase the speed of an 
adder by logkn gates . 
 
Figure 5:4- bit Carry lookahead adder 
The diagram shown above is of 16 bit adder .In this, there are groups of 4 bit taken 
together. The carry is generated from every logic cell and propagated to the next cell. 
Group generate (GG) and Group propagate (GP) are obtained parallel giving a faster 
adder. 
In carry lookahead adder the critical path travels in vertical direction instead of travelling 
in horizontal direction. The fan-out is only dependent on the total number of logic levels 
coming across the critical path instead of considering the delay for every logic gate in the 
design. In Carry lookahead fan in and fan out depends maximally on the critical path with 
the maximum amount of gates. The depth in a carry look ahead adder resembles the size of 
different groups in it and this being the reason the delay is almost equal to the log function 
of total size of an adder. The log function for depth makes it faster than any other design. 
Carry lookahead adder are widely used for designing. 
2.4 Parallel Prefix Adders: 
Adders play very important role in VLSI implementation and this being the reason they 
should be fast and small with very high efficiency. Parallel prefix adders (A. B. Smitth and 
C.C.Lim, 2001) serve with excellent performance in binary additions implemented in 
VLSI. These Parallel prefix adders (Choi, Y. and Earl E swartzlander Jr. ) (Knowles S. , 
Designing Fast and Small adder using Jackson and Talwar approach 
 
16 
 
1999) use simple logic cells to maintain various trade-offs like fan out, quantity of cells 
used and the amount of logic levels implemented and balance connection within  logic 
cells. Also parallel prefix adder presents the general adder structure that exhibits flexible 
area trade offs for an adder design. 
 
In adders, with an increase  in the width of the gates the delay  is  even increased, thus 
requires more time propagate or generate a carry from MSB to LSB so parallel prefix 
adders   modularises large logic gates into  fast and  smaller adder implementations . 
Also as discussed above we know that prefix adders depend a lot on the valency and if the 
valency is increased it will shoot up the number of CMOS cells used in the design which 
will further increase the delay in the critical path even if the total number of logic levels is 
decrease. The addition uses the terms (H.Ling, 1981) like kill (ki), propagate (pi) and 
generate (gi) functions for individual bit positions referenced as Цi= 1,2.......0? and for the 
adder width as Ц w?. 
                                                    
Figure 6: Block diagram Prefix circuit 
Stages for Designing a Parallel Prefix Adder: 
The designing of parallel prefix adders depends on the three stages describe below: 
? At the first stage, two bit binary number is supplied as inputs to compute generate, 
kill and propagate functions. These functions are formulated using general CMOS 
gates like NAND, NOR e.t.c. 
 
? The second stage calculates the computational logic for carries from each bit 
position and is known as Carry logic as in eq.  4 .In this stage the calculated carry 
from each bit is combined recursively with the other bits to finally  produce either 
of generate, kill or propagate functions. PG logic stage varies depending on 
configurations. Starting from MSB to LSB, generate and propagate or not kill is 
computed over each group of bits and are merged until the logic for each bit is 
traced. Two types of cells namely the grey cells and the black cells are used to 
implement the logic .This kind of prefix implementation adder is suitable for high 
valencies. Total number of stages depends upon the logic of log2n where n is the 
valency of an adder. 
 
? The last stage is for the totalling the sum from every bit position as in equation 5.                  
The use EXOR gate simplifies the logic in this stage.  The important point in this 
stage     is that the output carry of the previous position is supplied as an input to 
the next bit position. The diagram below gives an idea for designing basic Parallel 
prefix adder in three stages.

Figure 7: Block Diagram of Parallel prefix adder. 
 
For calculating all the above terms, here are some equations used while designing: 
Let the two inputs for the first stage be a = an-1 an-2 an-3....... a1 a0 and b = bn-1 bn-2 bn-3  .........   
b1 b0  going from LSB to MSB. 
 
The first stage computes Generate (g). Propagate (p) and not kill (~k) terms with the 
formulas given below. This is better explained in the above section.

? pi  =  ai ? bi                           
 
Second stage computes carry for output functions (g,p,~k) obtained from first stage . 
Giving the Carry group. The generation and propagation of carry bits is with the formula 
given below: 
Ci + 1  = gi  + ~kiCi      Equation 5 
The last stage is for computation of Sum which employs EXOR gate for calculating the 
values at every bit position: 
Si  =  pi  ? ci                          Equation 6 
 
The  carry function can be repeated following the recurrence in equation 5 using the terms 
ki  ,   gi   and  Co  :

Properties of Parallel Prefix Adders: 
The Parallel prefix adders depend on generate and not kill carry functions. An ordered pair 
  (nk and g) is defined with Ц?? Operator. (A. B. Smitth and C.C.Lim, 2001) .  
So,(nki. gj)  ? (nkj, gj) = ( nki nkj ,  gi   + nkj gi )

Three important properties of Ц?? operator are : 
1) Associativity:

Associativity allows the carry parallel application of above carry equation.

The overlapping if the terms give a regular function. It permits the sub trees  
of adders to work in parallelisation. 
 
The first and the third stage of a prefix adder will be fast as the carry calculation is 
dependent on individual cell logic where as the carry in the second stage covers 
comparatively longer distance which in return introduces delay .The different valency 
prefix operator are :

Black and Grey cells: 
While designing an adder we basically deal with almost same logic for every different bit. 
The logic we deal is of grey cell and black cell. As shown in the diagram of prefix cell we 
have grey and black cell represented as :

2.5  Types of Parallel Prefix adders: 
Variety of Parallel prefix adders are presented, a tough base for these adders is provided 
based on various trade пoffs like delay, area and capacitance. Here two types of parallel 
prefix adders are discussed as published paper рFamily of addersс discusses different kind 
of parallel prefix adder but Knowles have focussed mainly on Ladner and Fischer adder 
and Kogge-Stone adder. (Knowles S. , April 1999).  
 
2.5.1 Kogge-Stone: 
Kogge and Stone (P.M. Kogge and H.S. Stone, 1973) is another type of parallel prefix 
adder which can be used for designing adders. Kogge and Stone proposed a general 
recurrence scheme for parallel computation in 1973. Adders implemented using this 
technique is in favour due to the following: 
А        Regular layout 
А        Controlled fan-out 
In this implementation of parallel prefix adder the logical depth (number of carry 
computation stages) is maintained same which is equal to log2n. It generates the carry 
signals in O(log n) time, and is widely considered the fastest adder design possible. It is 
the common design for high-performance adders in industry. 
 
The lateral fan-out of each node in every stage is limited to unity by using the 
Idempotency property of prefix adder but this increases the number of gates by large 
amount and also corresponding increase in the amount of wiring due to the large number 
of overlapping of prefix terms being pre-computed, resulting in larger area. This type of 
adder also needs some buffering inverters to drive the capacitive load resulting due to a 
good amount of span of wires. The binary trees of "BK" cells in the Kogge and Stone 
adders are not sharing. Consequently the signal fan-out is reduced to the minimum at the 
expense of more "BK" cells. Since the delay increases with the fan-out, it is now a bit 
short. For this type , fan-out decreases with increasing performance. 
 
However, they are nothing but prefixed carry-lookahead adders. The intermediate carries is 
generated by replicating the prefix tree. Following figure shows the resultant prefix graph 
of a 16-bit prefix-2 Kogge Stone adder.

2.5.2 Ladner and Fischer: 
The Ladner пFischer adder is used as a base adder in this project. As mentioned by Ladner 
пFischer (R.E. Ladner and M.J. Fischer, 1980), this type utilises the model of double 
recursion. It minimises the number of logical cells and is calculated as (log2 n -1), n being 
the number of stages. It therefore eliminates Associativity present in prefix adders. In 
Ladner пFischer adders the capacitive load and the fan-out of the circuit amplifies due to 
large separation between the wires and the cells. The product circuit is obtained using 
double recursion and the buffering is done using the high load inverting amplifier. 
 
Longer distance between the wire increases more hardware time required thus increasing 
the fan-out. Similarly the computational time increases with increase in the depth of the 
circuit, 
 
So less the number of logics, decreased will be the delay . The circuit with the exact depth 
of log2n and the minimum possible length are detected by applying recursion. (log2 n -1) 
give the total number stages required in computation. 
 
 
       Figure 11:Prefix graph of Ladner - Fischer adder (R.E. Ladner and M.J. Fischer, 1980) 
In the Diagram the solid dots are representing the nodes, thus implementing prefix 
operation .The diagram shows only the carry bit generation and not sum. Depending on the 
position black and grey cells are used. Different gates are used to evaluate the value for G, 
k and p in the first row while the second gives the carry for every bit position. 
 
2.6 Ling Adders:  
Ling in 1981, proposed a new carry recurrence to reduce the logical depth for carry 
computation in parallel prefix adder structures. The algorithm introduced by Ling factored 
out the not kill bit from the Generate function (Vazquez, A.; Antelo, E., 2008 ) which 
reduced the logical depth and further reduced the complexity only at the first level where 
as the complexity of all other levels were same. The not kill term was producted with the 
generate term only at the end level which reduced delay. (H.Ling, 1981) 
Let a and b denote two n bit numbers: 
a=an-1 an-2 an-3....... a1 a0 
b=bn-1 bn-2 bn-3  .........   b1 b0

Background:  
As previously discussed the generate and not kill term are given with these equations: 
? gi = ai.bi 
? nki = ai+bi 
 
The General generate function for adder is : 
[   Gn:0  = gn + nkngn-1   + nkn-1gn-2 + nkn-1nkn-2  gn-3:7  ]         Equation 8: General non - Ling 
equation for adder 
where:                                                                                                                                           
? gn= an AND bn                
? kn= an Or bn .  
 The functions used in adder are purposely known as generate, kill and propagate 
functions. The obtained functions are carry generate and carry propagate, and carry 
generate is more intricate then carry propagate. On further solving the equations the 
delay can be reduced by decreasing the delay in most significant bit of the sum. 
 
Equations are : 
1. Generate function: 
1.Hn:0  = gn + gn-1   +nkn-1  gn-2 + nkn-1  nkn-2  gn-3:7              Equation 9:Ling generate function                 
In this equation Ling factored out the nk term (not kill bit) resulting on in the generate bit 
for all term and not kill bit for all stages except for the first stage Here the term Hn:0  is 
Ling?s pseudo carry term. 
 
The generalised form of the above equation is : 
Hn:0  = gn:k +kn:k  gk-1:0  .                          Equation 10: generalised form of equation  9 
With the help of factorisation, Ling proved that Ling?s pseudo carry term with generate 
group is equal to the original generate term obtained i.e. the factoring out of the not kill bit 
is sufficed by again multiplying the not kill bit with generate group in later stages, which 
reduces the use of an AND gate at every stage. The notations are shown below:

NOTE: Ling?s pseudo carry saves 1 logic level in comparison to Generalised Generate 
function. Whereas the implementation of Ling?s Pseudo carry Hn:0   is easy to implement 
then Gn:0.These Implementation of equations will be done using CMOS methodologies. 
Various Gates such as AOI, NAND, NOR will be used.

Basis of evaluation of Sum: 
The key point is to product the Pseudo carry with not kill bit in order to obtain the actual 
carry for a particular bit. This is achieved in the last stage of n bit adder and any extra 
delay is avoided by checking the critical path for a n-bit adder .The critical path can be 
evaluated from Least significant bit to n-1 bit .The carry from n-1th bit  is required in 
evaluating the sum and the expression for sum is : 
Sn = an ?bn ?Gn-1:0                                                                             Equation 14: Sum function for Ling theory

Recursions in pseudo carry generation: 
As Ling adder carries most of the properties of Prefix adder it also adopts the property of 
combination of pseudo carries over sub functions to generate pseudo carry of group .

Hn:0   = gn + Gn-1:x + nkn-1:x Gx-1:y        
Hn:0   = gn + Gn-1:x   +nkn-1:x  (gx-1 + gx-2:y ) 
Hn:0  =Hn:x + nk n-1: x-1 Hx-1:y      
The general generate function and the pseudo carry function are the same in complexities. 
So the speed of adders can be far more increased if Ling?s method becomes applicable to 
not only the first bit but to all other bit in order to decrease the complexity of generate 
functions and make them suitable as pseudo generate functions. 
 
2.7 Sparse trees:  
It is a method of separating the carry tree into critical and non critical sections in a design. 
(Sanu Mathew,Mark Anders,Ram K. Krishnamurthy and Shekhar Borkar, MAY 2003)In 
this carry from every single bit is not generated as in Kogge stone designs instead carry bit 
is generated from every fourth bit .The main concern is to move some carry  logic to non 
critical path thus reducing the number of propagate and generate bits in critical path. These 
carries combine normally with the sum logic in the multiplexer giving better results. This 
implementation of sparse carry tree reduces the fan-outs for generate and propagate bits 
but the number of logics remain the same in a circuit .Designing of adder is done using 
sparse п 2 and sparse -4 in this project. In sparse trees the carry prefixes from every nth 
column is considered despite of other D terms going into the same multiplexers.

2.8 Knowles 16 п bit adder: 
Binary addition can be done with different types of adder.  The most common types of 
adder discussed in Knowles paper Ladner п Fischer and Kogge- stone. The paper 
published (Knowles S. , 1999)  reflects that both these type of adders share common

important in a gate. So to make it simpler, different varieties of gates are placed in separate

2.9 Poly grids: 
For the obtaining size of an adder, we have considered grids for individual gates. An 
approximation of width and length for every gate is done on the basis of grids. Using grids 
is appropriate for estimating the height and width of a gate as grids cover the overall area 
in a gate. The distance between source and drain in a gate describes the length of a gate 
and this length is set by the width of ploysilicon gate .In every gate the grids are present 
showing the size of an adder and the presence of grids supports placement of any silicon 
piece in between them. 
Grids are the vertical tracks which are not drawn to scale but can be easily counted around 
polysilicon gate. All gates are examined for size based on their grids. Grids are always 
counted as one more then input. Considering total inputs as N the total number of grids in 
that gate will be N+1.

The diagram above shows an internal structure of a gate where: 
Cell п The width of a complete gate.

Grid1 -The distance from M1 to first polysilicon wire.                                                            
Grid2 - Distance from first polysilicon wire to other polysilicon wire.                                    
Grid3 - Distance from first polysilicon wire to metal M2. 
 
While designing, this method helps in arranging lot many gates symmetrically and thus 
helps EDA tools to adjust everything in a regular grid .For all gates we can find the size by 
counting the number of grids. Below are some of the examples of cell layouts for different 
gates. For example, to find the number of grids for a 3 input NAND gate, there are 4 grids 
for valency 3 NAND gate because we have 3 polysilicon wires.

So for counting the length of cell, the height and width of ploysilicon is considered and 
this is the reason for us considering grids for evaluating the size of logic gates. 
2.10 Logical Effort: 
Logical effort delay model is a design methodology for estimating the total number of 
CMOS stages required to implement logic function and to calculate delay. Logical 
method is the simplest and the accurate VLSI area model for prefix adders implemented in 
CMOS. It is a measure of the worst performance for the output current of any logic gate in 
comparison to an inverter. This comparison in gates is viable only when same capacitance 
is applied across their input. Logical effort can also be defined as the slope achieved by 
dividing delay v/s fan-out of logic gate to the inverter. 
Terms related (Burgess N. , New Models of Parallel Prefix Adder Topologies, 2005):          
 Logical effort ,g   - FET gate capacitance to minimum sized inverter for same output 
current.                                                                                                                            
Electrical effort, h -   ratio of output capacitance for each CMOS logic gate along critical 
path. Branching effort, b - ratio of total capacitive load on one CMOS logic gate output to 
the gate capacitance of the next CMOS on critical path.                                                                 
Total logical effort: It gives the collective logical effort of all inputs present in the logic 
gate together. The Total logical effort of NOR gate means logical effort of both the inputs 
whereas the logical effort on NOR gate means taking logical effort of one input instead of 
two input transistors. It is therefore the sum of the logical effort per input for each input to 
the logic gate. 
Calculating Logical effort: 
For calculating the logical effort, we design a logic gate with the characteristics almost 
equivalent to that of an inverter specifically the output current drive. Logical effort 
(Sutherland, 1999) is the ratio of capacitances and so for its calculation we consider the 
arbitrary values of capacitance which enables simple calculations.  
 Initially all the transistors are considered of the minimum length so that the width covers 
maximum transistor sizes. Usually the pull up transistor is broader then pull down 
transistor for holding the same conductance value.  
           ?= ?n /?p     where,   ? gives the ratio of PMOS and NMOS with in an inverter.   
Basically, the value of NMOS / pull down transistor is Цw? whereas the pull up /PMOS 
transistor is Ц2w?, so the overall capacitance is calculated as 3 which is the value of an 
inverter as shown in fig. below: 
 
 
Designing Fast and Small adder using Jackson and Talwar approach 
 
28 
 
Figure 16: Different gates showing different values of capacitance 
The circuits shown are of two different input logic gates i.e. NAND and NOR. In NAND, 
two pull down /NMOS transistors are arranged in series. According to ohm?s law, value of 
the capacitance remains equal if the transistors are in series. Reason for previous statement 
is that these transistors must have twice the value of conductance in comparison to an 
inverter. Whereas the value of PMOS/ pull up transistors in a NAND gate, remains the 
same to achieve same drive as an inverter. These conductance values of NMOS and PMOS 
are important for further calculating the different efforts like logical effort (g), branching 
effort (b) and parasitic delay (p).  
The total input capacitance for one input signal is considered as the sum of widths for 
NMOS and PMOS gates. For NAND gate, the value of the CMOS capacitances is 2+2 = 4. 
For an inverter the total capacitance is equal to 1+2 = 3. Therefore the logical effort for 2 п 
input NAND is g = 4/3. On the contrary, for NOR gate, the pull down transistor will have 
their regular capacitance values (i.e., 1)  but  for pull up transistor, width of each  transistor 
is will be  4 units wide because it has to be equate  the width for pull up transistor of an 
inverter gate which is 2 units .So the resulting capacitance of a NOR logic gate will be  g = 
4+1 = 5/3.From above we see that for NOR gate g(logical effort) is more than NAND?s 
logical effort because the pull down transistor are the major contributor for building 
capacitance whereas  pull up are not similarly important for the same task. 
Asymmetric Logic gate: 
Asymmetric logic gates are the one whose logical effort differs with the total number of 
inputs. Till now we have evaluated logical effort for symmetric gates (Sutherland, 1999) 
but for asymmetric gates like A2O2I, the circuits have been shown as below :

In asymmetric gates as well the transistors tries to equate their values with an inverter. In 
the pull-up structure, each pull-up transistor is having the size of 4 but the  pulldown 
transistors remain same with the size of 1.The table should be referred while calculating 
logical effort. According to the table and the formulas given, the logical effort for A2O2I 
is obtained as, g = 17/3.

Parasitic delay: 
In a logic gate, transistors have values for internal resistance. This internal resistance is 
highly dependent on the sizes of transistors. Due to this internal resistance in the transistors 
there is a parasitic delay caused. So, parasitic delay, in a logic gate is the count of internal 
delay caused because of internal resistance.  The total diffusion capacitance on output node 
of a CMOS logic gate in relevance to the input FET gate capacitance of minimum sized 
inverter gives an estimation of parasitic delay caused. On the whole, it is the drain 
capacitance present in a logic gate .Transistor sizes does not help in inculcating the drain 
capacitance. The value of gate capacitance is equal to that of the drain capacitance and so 
the value of parasitic delay gives us an average of overall drain capacitance in comparison 
to inverter. Table 6 given below will help in calculating parasitic delay in a gate.  
 
 
 
                                                                                               
 
 
Table 8: Parasitic delay 
Electrical effort:  The electrical effort is the total output load capacitance over input 
capacitance. The methodology of Logical effort is based upon capacitances where 
Electrical effort gives the ratio of output over input capacitance. The valuation of input and 
output capacitance is dependent on the given values of transistors sizes. 
 
Figure 18: Electrical effort in a gate (Sutherland,Sproull, Harris, 1999) 
Optimisation of critical path: 
During the final stage of calculation of Logical effort, the critical path is chosen and for the 
overall estimation of delay the critical path is optimized. The parameters and the formulas 
given below are used while calculating delay. The technological speed parameter we take 
is ?, usually for a .25?m process the delay is 16- 20ps and it varies depending on the 
design process taken. 
Summary of the method: 
 
? After taking the critical path , the total logical effort is calculated as  F= GBH  .The  
path Logical effort (g) of each gate on the critical path is calculated by considering 
the width of each gate and is defined as the product of  the logical effort of all

individual gates employed in the critical path.  Then the value of branching effort b 
is calculated by taking the product of branching effort of all the gates in the path 
and finally the value of H which is Cout/ Cin which gives the overall capacitance of 
initial and the final stages in the design. 
? Secondly the total number of stages in a circuit is very important as it should give 
the least delay , if the number if stages obtained after the calculation with the 
formula of N=round(   log4F) is more than encountered from the diagram then  it 
needs to be equalised by adding an inverter in the design. This ways the actual 
number of stages in a CMOS circuit is obtained by adding or removing stages till 
the number of N. 
? Total delay of the circuit when all N stages have equal effort, can be calculated as: 
D= (N ? + ?p) by taking the sum of all the parasitic delays and also ? = F1/N  . 
? Finally the delay is obtained in terms of FO4. Fan-out-of-4  is considered 
equivalent to 5? for any design so the delay is divided by 5 at the end . FO4 is 
explained as the total delay of an inverter driving four copies of it.

3 Research Methodology and Adder Design:  
 
3.1 High Speed Binary Addition: 
Jackson and Talwar (2004) focused on constructing the carry at all levels in the hierarchy. 
They investigated that no single technique for implementation of an adder is present. All 
the adders are based on some or the other techniques. The families of adders mainly 
parallel prefix adder can be derived from the reduced generate and hyper propagate 
functions which are a generalization of the Ling pseudo carry. Ling reduced the delay by 
minimizing the generate function but this simplification was only applied to first level and 
otherwise the complexity at all the other levels resembles to that of a parallel prefix adder. 
High Speed Binary Addition (R.C.Jackson and S. Talwar, Nov 2003) provides the novel 
methodology of simplifying group generate function at all levels of logic thus reducing the 
complexity of group generate at all levels of the logic instead of just first level. Jackson 
and Talwar approach deals with generation of a carry and balancing reduced generate 
group with the not kill group. 
 
Note: This section discusses Jackson and Talwar technique (R.C.Jackson and S. Talwar, 
Nov 2003) in a more clear way. An effort is made to make equations more users friendly. 
 
Considering addition of two binary numbers an ,an-1,an-2 ииa0 and  bn ,bn-1,bn-2 ииb0 
.Parallel prefix adders computes carry propagate (p) and generate (g) functions. The initial 
stage gives the two mentioned functions for every bit: 
gn   =   an bn  
pn   =  an + bn.          
 
The binary step methods combines generate term and propagate term to give complete 
generate function. As discussed  
 
Gn:0  = Gn:k + Pn:k  Gk-1:0                    Equation 15: group generate 
 
Pn:0  = Pn:k  Pk-1:0                                      Equation 16: propagate group 
 
Above given functions can be written for high valency formulations. For high valency the 
groups are more segregated. The feedback for higher radix formulation is that while 
approaching towards high radix the functions become complex with the increased 
complexity in logic. So, in a design forming different groups is helpful. 
For the equation below three segregation of group is done from n to k , k-1 to k? and k?-1 
to 0.  
Gn:0  = Gn:k + Pn:k  Gk-1:kу  +   Pn:k  Pk-1:kу  Gkу-1:0    Equation 17: generate equation for higher 
radix cells 
 
Pn:0  = Pn:k  Pk-1:kу Pkу-1:0                                        Equation 18: Propagate function for higher radix 
cells. 
 
The factorised term from ling?s addition is our counterpart.  
 
The equation that Jackson and Talwar gave for reducing the carry bit at every single stage 
is:

33 
 
Rn:0  = gn + gn-1   +gn-2 + nkn-1nkn-2:7  gn-3:7  + .......   Equation 22 
where 
Rn:0  is the reduced carry function which removes not kill term from as many as levels as 
required in order to reduce complexity from the generated term for every bit. 
 
The products the Reduced carry function with the not kill factor to obtain the carry 
generate function as: 
Gn:0  = nkn . R
 (j)
 n:0        Equation 23 
Where j= range for which the number of not kill bits are factored out or the superscript 
describes the range  over which the carry is evaluated. 
 
Factorization of reduced carry equation for the valency of 7: 
R
 (3)
 7:0 = g7 + g6+g5 + nk4:0 g4:7  + .......  Equation 24 
 
As we have seen in equation 23 
G7:0 = nk7 . R
 (3)
 7:0 
G7:0 =  (g7  + nk7 )  . R
 (3)
 7:0           Equation 25 
 
Multiply with the factor in order to make it compatible for 8- bits: 
(g7  + nk7 ) 
 
Replacing R (3) 7:0  with the factorization value given in Equation 24 , we obtain: 
G7:0 =  (g7  + nk7nk6  )  . (g7 + g6+g5 + nk6nk5:7  g4:7  + ....... )                    Equation 26 
 
Making the equations simple: 
consider  (  nk7nk6  )  as A   and  (g6+g5 + nk6nk5:7  g4:7  + ....... )  as B 
and  now further solving: 
G7:0 = ( g7  + A )  .  ( g7  + B ) 
G7:0   =   g7 + g7 A + A B + g7 B 
G7:0   = g7   + (1+ A +B ) + AB                    (1+ A +B )=1 in Boolean algebra 
G7:0   = g7  + AB                        Equation 27 
G7:0   = g7 + (  nk7nk6  )  (g6+g5 + nk6nk5:7  g4:7  + ....... ) 
G7:0  =( g7 nk7 +  g7 nk6  )  . (g6+g5 + nk6nk5:7  g4:7  + ....... ) 
G7:0  =( g7+  g7 nk6  )  . (g6+g5 + nk6nk5:7  g4:7  + ....... )         equation 9 gn:0=   nkn .gn:0 
 
On further solving we get the generate equation 4 
G7:0  = g7 + nk7g6   + nk6g5 + nk6nk5  g4:7               Equation 28 
 
Thus it proves : 
[Gn:0  = nkn . R
 (j)
 n: 0]  The 2
nd
   bracketed term is Ling?s Pseudo carry . The first term is 
generalised as D which is the combination function generate function and propagate 
function over the limit of n to i. 
The logic functions we need to factorize are: 
Dn:i   = Gn:i + nkn:i                          Equation 29 
= Gn:i +1 + nkn:i 
 
Bn:i =      gn +  gn-1 +  gn-2 ............. +  gn-i                         Equation 30 
If in case the addition of a and b terms  i. e: an-1 an-2 an-3....... a0 + bn-1 bn-2 bn-3  .........   b1 
b0  is high then a carry out is generated and the other function Bn:i  is high if  the value of 
Dn:i    is high with in n to i range. 
Designing Fast and Small adder using Jackson and Talwar approach 
 
34 
 
So, in general form: 
Gn:k  =  Dn:i[Bn:i + Gn-1:i ]                    Equation 31 
[Bn:i + Gn-1:i ]  is the reduced complexity function. 
 
The correction term ЦD? can be is multiplied with Reduced carry function in order to obtain 
Generate function: 
Gn-1:0  = Dn-1:n-k  .   R
 (k)
 n:0           Equation 32 
 
The Ling factorization is used to obtain reduced carry bit and for higher valencies the 
correction term is equal to the not kill bits. 
Dn-1:n-1    =  nkn-1 
Dn-1:n-2     = gn-1 + nkn-1:n-2 
Dn-1:n-3      =  gn-1 + nkn-1:n-2 + nkn-1:n-3 
Dn-1:n-k      =  [Gn-1 + nkn-1:n-k]                  Equation 33 
 
So the complexity of reduced carry function is reduced with the increased correction term. 
Thus, the logic expression D have less complexity than the generalised  group generate 
function G  in terms of R. So we use less CMOS logic cells to implement this. The 
correction term can be evaluated by considering it over the limits n-1 to 0 for generate 
term and the not kill bits over the limits of n-1 to n-k.For obtaining high performance in 
the Adders we have to balance these two terms i.e R and D so that both are of reduced 
complexities for high valency  as well.  
The equation to compute sum for bit position n is given as, 
 
Sn =  pn  ? Gn-1:0 
Sn  =  pn  ? D?Rn-1:0 
Sn  =  (Rn-1:0)
-1
(pn) + Rn-1:0 (pn  ? D) 
 
 
Hyper propagate function, q: 
As seen above we know that recursion covers an important part of ling?s equations. This 
refers that the Pseudo carries can be build over the sub groups and preceding groups ahead. 
And Recursion is also very important for our higher radix implementations in reduced 
carry functions (G. Dimitrakopouloas and D. Nikolos, February 2005.) 
(R.C.Jackson and S. Talwar, Nov 2003). 
This can be proved by considering equations given in High Speed Binary Equations: 
Gn:k  =  Dn:i[Bn:i + Gn-1:i ] 
Gn:k   =  [G n:k   + nkn:k Gk-1:i ] or 
Gn:k   =  [G n:k   + Pn:k Gk-1:i ] 
The complexity of reduced function if decreased will enhance the performance in an adder. 
The range of function is divided in to three different ranges which are from n-1:k ,k-1:k? 
and k?-1:0. Later the midpoints are selected for detecting other subgroups. 
 
Considering the reduced generate function: 
R
 
n-1:0 
(n-m)
 = Bn-1:m + Gm-1:0                Equation 34 
The expression Gm-1:0 is further divided in different limits ,so now we have: 
R
 
n-1:0 
(n-m)
 = Bn-1:m + Gm-1:kу + Pn:k Gkу-1:0 
R
 
n-1:0 
(n-m)
 = [Bn-1:mk ] +[ Bk-1:m Gm-1:kу ] + Pm-1:kу Gkу-1:0    Equation 35 
The 1st and 2nd bracketed should be removed in order to obtain the final generate term 
because it all recursion.

The width of Q function is same as that of R function. The Q function can be obtained for 
every stage by combining the not kill term and Correction term as shown below:

Terms
 
Pm-1:kу Dkу-1:mу    are referred to as Hyper Propagate, and this recursive functions needs 
to be build recursively. The construction of Hyper Propagate considering the group of 
propagated functions and the building of generated functions can be examined below: 
Dn:k =  Dn:i[Bn:i + Dn-1:i ]                Equation 37 
Dn:k =  Gn:i  +    Pn:i+ Dn-1:i           Equation 38 
The function  Pm-1:kу Diу-1:mу     can be generalised as: 
Qn-1:0
(n-m)
 = Pn-1:mу Dm-1:0     Equation 39 
The range of function is divided in to three different ranges which are from  n-1:k ,k-1:k? 
and k?-1:0 . 
 
The limits are further divided to m and m? as the intersection of other sub groups. Using 
equation 37 
Qn-1:0
(n-m)
 = Pn-1:mу Dm-1:iу [    Bm-1:iу + Diу-1:0 ]  Equation 40 
Qn-1:0
(n-m)
 = Pn-1:iPi-1:m Dm-1:iу [    Bm-1:iу + Diу-1:0 ]     Equation 41 
 
Further solving the D function and the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 bracketed term can be structured as: 
Qn-1:0
(n-m)
 = Pn-1:iPi-1:m Dm-1:iу [    Bm-1:iу   +  Gi?-1:m?  +    Piу-1:mу Dmу-1:0           ]

(i-m)
    [  Rm-1:m?
(m-i?)
   +  Qi?-1:0
(i?-m?)
 ]    Equation 42 
The above shown equation is the reduced form of hyper propagate function. 
 
The width of Q is same as R. We can observe that with different cases the reduced 
generate function is less complex then the general generate function. It is really helpful as 
it replaces not kill bits with Q function with in turn reduces a logic level while realising in 
CMOS.

3.2 New adder designs:   
For implementing adder designs based on the discussed theory of Jackson ad Talwar , low 
valency gates are used . I have designed two novel designs of adder. The published paper 
Family of adders discusses different kind of parallel prefix adder but Knowles have 
focussed mainly on Ladner and Fischer adder. Then out of these two types Ladner and 
Fischer is proven to be better in the previous MSc students? research .This being the reason 
I have considered the base configuration of Ladner п Fischer and using the technique of 
Jackson and Talwar on that parallel prefix adder to obtain the small and fast structure.  
 
Also as we have discussed about sparse trees and it is observed that application of sparse 
tree is a wise decision as it reduces the size of an adder by reducing the fan-out through  
reduced pseudo generate groups and thereby reducing the number of gates. Also the usage 
of sparse tree depends upon the configuration and type of adder used for designing along 
with the theory applied to it. These two adders designs are tested with the new method of 
implementing sparse trees and the results are listed. Valency 2 and 3 are used to design the 
new adder designs. 
 
For proving the size of the new adder is smaller, a comparison of the total number of gates 
used in original 16 bit Ladner -Fischer adder is done with the total number of gates used in 
novel 16- bit adder in a tabular form. 
 
All the designing procedure and key points required to logically design an adder are 
mentioned in this chapter. The equations obtained after applying theory, gates used in 
designing, their logical effort with individual gate capacitance are shown. This being the 
designing project provides the basic designs of an adder. The adder is small and fast, this is 
theoretically proved by Logic delay model and by comparing the size of the novel adder 
with that of the recently used adder. 
All the above mentioned adders and their testing with sparse are explained in this chapter.

3.3 16- bit Parallel Prefix adder based on Jackson and Talwarуs 
approach: 
The logic diagram of 16 bit adder is given presenting all the logic gates. There are total 
three stages for calculating carry bit .Valency two and valency three gate are used as the 
delay increases with the valency. Sum is computed at the end of every individual bit using 
Multiplexers. In this design, the initial level provides output as generate and not kill values 
of every single bit taken as input and these bits are propagated till msb to calculate the 
required value of carry and sum. All D, Q terms and other terms are clearly drawn in the 
diagram for simplicity.

Figure 21: dot diagram representation of adder carry tree 
Designing Fast and Small adder using Jackson and Talwar approach

The dot diagram clearly shows a 2*4*2 adder. The 3 levels calculating carry are 
represented by dark circular dots. In the initial level, a and b are given as the input to the 
A22O2I gates and O22A2I gates.  This level generates all the reduced generate term from 
R
(1)
 1:0  to R
(1)
15:14   , and every term will have one not kill taken out or missing. The 
reduced generate terms are calculated using A2O2I gates and the other group in the first 
level is not kill group which is from ~k2:1 to ~k14:13 and are generated using O2A2I gates . 
 
In the second stage we have valency 4, but in the design, two gates of valency 2 are 
used. This means that the total inputs are 4 but to reduce the delay in the logic gate, logical 
equations are mathematically modified to use valency 2 gates instead of valency 4 gate. 
Though stage two uses one stage but it still requires two logic gates because the carry 
computation logic is complicated and the fan out load shoots up in this stage and keeps on 
increasing towards msb. As discussed for the requirements in adder, it is very important to 
have buffering among carry logic because high fan out requires the inverter to sustain 
excessive fan out load. In the second stage also required amount of not kill bit can be 
factored out so the combinations of at maximum 4 reduced groups can be combined to 
generate the sub groups of R
(3)
 7:0  to R
(3)
15:8   . In this stage we obtained G term by 
multiplying the number of not kill bits in reduced group term i.e.  D ? R so there are three 
not kill bit missing in the reduced generate terms. 
 
Depending on the valency gates are taken, the implementation of valency 2 can be done 
using single gate as it has two inputs. For valency 3, factorisation of one bit can be done or 
else implementation of three valency can be done. In the adder designed, two logic levels 
are used for valency 4 logic with 3 not kill bits factored out and the total number of input 
are four after mathematical reduction in the equation. If the gate is in the critical path and 
more number of not kill bit is factored out than it increases the number of terms in D group 
and so the complexity which further add to the delay in the circuit . 
 
The last stage for calculating carry consist of valency 2 gates which computes the carry for 
two groups of reduced generate term again and the output is given to the multiplexers. The 
implementation of multiplexers is done using sparse tree at the end for computing sum. 
As shown, for computing sum, for every multiplexer, a R term is present. This R term 
takes lot more time than other not kill group for computation. Delay in the circuit majorly 
depends on the complexity of R term. With the supply of R term in a mux, it is tried that 
the complexity should be reduced by increasing more number of bits in the D term. For 16- 
multiplexer we have 16 R terms going into it. 
 
Equations for every sum bit: Below are the equations based on Jackson and Talwar 
technique used for designing the 16 bit adder. In this adder, gates are designed based on 
logic equations obtained. Depending on the terms in the equation, valency for each gate is 
decided. Here are the important equations given for having an idea of the work done in the 
presented adder:

From the above diagram, it can be observed that the total number of stages is 7 and that is 
including everything from the first stage of O22A2I to the last sum logic into the 
multiplexer. It has three levels of logic divided in 7 stages. The first stage generates a 
Reduced generate term which along with the other inputs goes into stage 2 where it 
computes the subgroups of R term.  
 
The second stage consist total of two logic levels resulting in two inputs gates to compute 
valency 2 equations. Output from O22A2I gates travels into valency-2 O2A2I and then in 
A2O2I. Resulting signal from above gates completes stage two. Now substitution of two 
inverters is done. The first inverter is employed as a buffer for driving four gates in third 
stage and the second inverter is placed to equalise the number of stages to be equal to the 
value of N obtained while calculating the logical effort.  
 
The output signal obtained after second stage is the propagation of carry from all the lower 
bits which goes into the A2O2I gate to give an R term which is further given as an input to 
the multiplexer to compute the sum. The R term take more time to travel then other inputs 
to the multiplexer. 
 
In sum logic, each multiplexer is supplied with an R term. This design is made by 
employing the technique of Jackson and Talwar. 
 
Logical Effort Calculations for above 16 bit adder:  Referring the table 5 and 6 given in 
logical effort description will be helpful to evaluate the values of g, b and p. The table 
below shows the values of capacitance in terms of g.b and p and also the cells on the 
critical path to calculate the total delay in the circuit. 
For calculating the delay in the circuit we add the capacitance of wire as 2/3 as per 
according to the standard assumptions. (Burgess N. , Implementation of recursive Ling 
adders in CMOS VLSI, 2009)

3.4 16- bit adder parallel prefix adder using Sparse-2 carry tree logic: 
The second adder designed is with Sparse-2 carry tree logic. Sparse-2 carry tree logic is 
not yet proposed, so taking an initiative of testing sparse -2 carry tree logic with Jackson 
and Talwar approach. The aim of designing this adder is to test, whether Sparse-2 carry 
tree logic shows any impact in the size or delay of an adder. The bit configuration used for 
designing this adder is 8*8 and low valency cells 2*3*2 are used for implementing the 
logic obtained. The Logic diagram is shown below. 
 
Figure 24 Logic diagram of 16 bit adder with sparse 2 carry logic 
As shown , each R term goes into two multiplexers which reduces the delay as every single 
generate term propagates through two multiplexers thus instead of 16 R terms going to 16 
Multiplexers , the implementation of 8 R term is done into 16 multiplexers  which saves 
the wiring capacitance from R
(1)
 1:0  to R
(3)
7:0 and  R
(3)
 7:0  to R
(3)
15:8 thus  reducing the 
overall wire capacitance  by almost half the value and giving the same R and D terms in 
the circuit. Also in sum computation , the D group is made more complex as this reduces 
the complexity in the R term which adds  to the delay in the critical path and having 
complex D term does not affect the delay as they are not in critical path. 
Critical path in 16- bit adder is taken as S15  as it is the longest path covering maximum 
number of gates in this adder . With the implementation of sparse-2 carry logic the 
Reduced pseudo generate term R
(2)
13:0 goes into both the multiplexers of S15 and S14 . 
Diagram below shows the critical path of this adder.

Logical effort calculating the delay is shown in the table below. The difference in the 
values s noticeable from R
(3)
7:0 . In this design, instead of driving 8 gates only four A2O2I 
gates are driven by the Reduced term of R
(3)
7:0  . This reduction in the logic is due to the 
use of Sparse carry tree which helps in reducing the fan-out from R
(3)
7:0.   
Also now each R signal is going into to multiplexer and therefore we can observe change 
in the table exposing R
(2)
14:0 driving two multiplexers.

Here are the equations given in order to understand the building up of this Sparse-2 carry 
adder .Starting for LAB these equations go to MSB. Each and every bit is explained 
below. All generate, not kill and propagate term are written with the equations. 
 
As there is only the input bits for S0 we have it as                                                                 
S0 = P0 =  a0   ?  b0 =  (~ a0   ? b0 ) +  (a0   ? ~b0)                                           
 
For S1 the carry from S0 has to be propagated and the combination of generate and not kill 
bit is done in first stage, so S1 = P1 ?  G0:0  =>  G0:0 = g0 
? S1 = ((a0   ?  b0) ?  (a0  ?  b0)) 
For S2  again the carry from R
(1)
1:0  is propagated so                                                             
S2= P2 ?  G1:0  =>  G1:0 = g1+ nk1 g0 =>  R

1:0  Multiplexer is used as R

different values when it is true or false. The use of sparse tree make this R

for S3 the same R
(1)
1:0  signal is used.                                                                                             
S2= P2 ?  nk1 R

For S3 carry from R
(1)
1:0  with one not kill term missing is propagated so  S3= P3 ?  G2:0   => 
G2:0 =  g2+ nk2 + nk2:1g0   now because of R
(1)
1:0 signal being propagated , the multiplication 
of G2:2 term is multiplied as this term is missing .

For S4  ,the carry from R
(1)
3:0  is propagated so S4 = P4 ?  G3:0  =>  G3:0   = nk3? R
(1)
3:0 and

3:0  with one not kill term missing is propagated so  S5= P5 ?  G4:0  =>  
G4:0   =  g4+ (nk4 ? R
(1)
3:0  ) now because of R
(1)
3:0 signal being propagated , the 
multiplication of G4:4\ term is multiplied as this term is missing .

For S6 carry from R
(3)
5:0 is propagated and we have a group of D terms which reduces the 
complexity of R

3.5 16- bit adder design based on Jackson and Talwar approach with 
Sparse-4 carry tree logic: 
A 16- bit adder is given which uses Sparse-4 carry logic. The adder is made It is 16- bit 
adder designed with valency 2*3*2 and with the bit group configuration of 4*6*6 from 
MSB to LSB. As using Sparse-4 carry tree in this Jackson and Talwar adder design the 
carry group in this adder is derived from every fourth bit position which reduces the fan-
out of carries in carry tree logic.  
The bit configuration in this is taken 4*6*6 so that design should consider computing two 
stages almost simultaneously. The stages of 6*6 takes almost same time as both the stages 
have 3 not kill bits missing and apply same logic of computation.  The diagram given 
below shows the logic diagram of an adder.

The critical path showed above implements seven stages. Equations for above shown is: 
 
S12 = G11:0 xor  p12 = ~G11:0  &  p12 + G11:0& ~p12 
 
S13 = g12 + nk12  &  G11:0 = G11:0   &   (g12  xor  p12) + G11:0  &  (nk12  xor  p12) 
   which could be rewritten as 
      ~G11:0  (G12:12 xor  p12)    &  G11:0  (  D12:12   xor   p12) 
 
S14 = g13 + nk13g12 + nk13nk12&G11:0 = G13:12 + nK13:12 & G11:0 
   = ~G11:0&(G13:12   xor    p12) + G11:0  &  (D13:12 xor p12) 
 
S15 = g14 + nk14g13 + nK14:13g12 + nK14:12&G11:0 = G14:12 + nK14:12&G11:0 
   = ~G11:0    &   (G14:12 xor p12)      +    G11:0    &   (D14:12 xor p12)

Table 16: Total number of gates in 16- bit adder with Sparse 4 tree logic 
The total number of gates used in this design is 109 and the total grids are 498 which is 
comparatively smaller than other designs. 
 
3.6 Design methodology of an adder: 
In this section the adder implemented consist of three stages for calculating the sum. The 
points mentioned below were experienced practically while designing different adders 
presented in this thesis. Here are some key points disclosed for designing an adder. 
1. First stage consists of deriving the bit generate and bit propagate terms. A 2- bit 
binary number is supplied as an input to a gate for computing all single bits. The 
gate here can be used as A22O2I or O22A2I gates over 2- bits each for generating 
terms for R terms. For example if we have a 16-bit adder then the generation of R
 
(1)
15:14  - R
(1)
1:0 with missing one not kill bit is evaluated in first stage.   
 
2. Second stage is used for calculating carry tree logic as it converts the generated 
groups in first stage into the reduced generate groups .In this stage the reduced 
generate group is combined up to valency 4 or valency 3 equations such as R
(3)
7:0  
with 3 missing not kill bits .Removing of not kill bit from Generate group(G) thus 
forming reduced group(R)  means that the removed not kill bit will be present in D 
term. Depending upon the valency, desired gate can be used. For example, valency- 
2 does not require any not kill bit to factor out as the logic can be implemented 
using single gate. For valency 3-4 we can use single gate but with some bits 
factored out in D term. Different logic gates can be implemented for generating 
reduced terms. It is beneficial to use low valency gates because high valency gates 
like valency 6 requires two level of logic where more number of bits can be 
factored out. With increasing number of bits factored out, the complexity of D term 
increases which might upshot the critical path through this D term thus increasing 
delay in the design.

51 
 
 
3. Third stage contributes for calculating sum in a design. In this stage the reduced 
term is added to sum logic at every single bit position. An EX-OR gate is employed 
having one input as the propagate bit and the second input comprises of carry into 
that bit position. A multiplexer is employed and depending on the polarity of input, 
it has one inverted input and other not inverted. The inverted input is driven faster 
than not inverted and this is why slow gate like EX-OR are attached on the inverted 
input.

4 Experimental Results: 
The result table given below shows all the results obtained for the adders designed with 
Jackson and Talwar approach. Also reflects the result of adder designed by merging 
Jackson and Talwar?s approach with Sparse -2 and Sparse-4 carry logic. All the designs 
are 16-bit designs and are strictly based on the taken approach taken. Manual calculation is 
used for calculating delay and the size of the designs. 
Note: Comparing delay and size with Knowles 16-bit conventional adder(as discussed in 
section 1.8) in the table shows the improvement gained in the designs obtained in this 
project.

Explanation of Results: 
1. The design obtained by implementing the approach of Jackson and Talwar with 
low valency of 2*3*2 carry tree showed a drastic improvement of almost 1 .5 FO4 
in delay. The size of an adder was almost decreased by 69 gates.  As verified by 
comparing the above two adders i.e. Knowles adder and new J &T adder it?s been 
observed that the number gates in the latest L п F are 198 and the sum of total grid 
depicting the size of an adder is 601 whereas for novel adder the number of gates 
are 120 and the number of grids are 532 saving 69 gates and hence proving the 16 п 
bit new J & T adder to be smaller and faster than other latest adders. 
2. The second 16- bit adder which is merging J & T with Sparse carry-2 came out to 
be smaller and faster than the conventional Knowles adder. But comparing the new 
designs i.e. 16- bit adder J & T and 16- bit adder J & T with sparse-2 , than it can 
be observed that using Sparse two  definitely helps in reducing the size of an adder 
but the delay difference is not much .It gives almost same delay as 16- bit adder J 
& T adder. 
3. The 16- bit adder J & T adder with sparse -4 having the bit configuration of 4*6*6 
proved out to be the best way of designing the adders. The results showed delay to 
be reduced by a considerable margin and the number of gates used was relatively 
less than that used for other two designs discussed.

5 Critical evaluation: 
The aim of the project was to design a faster and smaller adder in VLSI using CMOS 
technology. The above mentioned aim is achieved by designing 16- bit adder which is fast 
and small. Achievement of the aim is done by sequentially considering different aspects of 
designing. Various steps leading to success for this project are listed. Also, the choices 
made, owe an explanation for being the best options are provided below. 
 
1. The choice of taking this project was done because Jackson and Talwar approach is 
one of the best techniques that can help in designing comparatively fast and small 
adders. This approach provides flexibility in designing as it balances both, the 
reduced generate group and the not kill group further reducing the delay and fan-
out in critical path of an adder design making it faster and smaller. Ling Technique 
could also be used and it is used for designing fast adders but Jackson and Talwar 
approach is a new approach which was not yet proved. So, taking Jackson and 
Talwar approach gave me a challenge of proving the theory. 
 
2. An important decision was made by choosing Ladner - Fischer adder instead of 
Kogge- stone adder. According to the published paper of Knowles (Knowles S. , 
1999) Ladner п Fischer and Kogge-stone adder are the only two adders which are 
chief among the known construction of other adders as they share common 
property of minimum logical depth. Then in the thesis conducted by one of the 
M.Sc student of Bristol University proved that in Ladner Fischer adder the logic 
levels for computing the carry group is kept minimum. The depth of log2 n is 
considered which reduces the delay better than what Kogge-stone does. This being 
the reason Ladner -Fischer adder over runs Kogge п stone adder. And it is taken as 
the base design for comparison in this thesis. 
 
3. While designing, low Valency gates such as valency 2-3 are used. Using low 
valency cells give better reduction in fan-out between the carry generated groups. 
Also low valency cell contributes in reducing the overall size of an adder by 
decreasing the amount of load used for driving gates. Instead of using Low valency 
the employment of high valency gates can be done. But it is observed that using 
low valency gates is more beneficial than using high valency as low valency the 
number of grids in a gate will also be less which will contribute for reducing the 
size of a full circuit. 
 
4. The technique used for calculating the speed of an adder is Logical effort.  This is 
the most appropriate method for evaluate the designing of adder in VLSI area 
model as it considers all different capacitances involved in gates and wiring in a 
circuit. The algorithm of Logical effort traces the reducibility and idempotency of 
the tree topologies. Instead of this method the speed of adder can be tested by using 
Cadence tool. But due to the limited time span, simulation of an adder using 
Cadence was not possible. 
 
5. For comparing the size of new adder, a tabulated comparison of the total number of 
overall gates in a new design with the total number of gates in conventional 16- bit 
Ladner-Fischer adder is done . Depending on the theory that the count of the total 
grids defines the size of a gate. Grids are the vertical spaces covering Polysilicon 
gate which are not scaled to paper but can be easily counted.  The logic gates in a 
design are multiplied with their polysilicon grids present in a logic cell. A 
Designing Fast and Small adder using Jackson and Talwar approach 
 
54 
 
comparison of the total number of gate size in a design reflects the overall size of 
an adder. Instead of comparing manually, an actual layout of an adder can be 
designed using cadence tool but again due to limited time, use of tool was not 
feasible. 
 
6. Further merging of sparse carry tree is merged with Jackson and Talwar approach. 
Implementing this concept of merging was definitely the best option as it resulted 
in a much smaller and faster adder, even as compared to Jackson and Talwar adder. 
The result obtained clearly reflects the advantages of implementing sparse carry 
tree logic. In this logic carry from every fourth bit is supplied instead of every 
single bit which reduces the fan-out in the design. Sparse carry tree is a broad 
concept which can be further optimized to give remarkable results.

6 Conclusions: 
After working on this thesis some important points are clear. With the consideration of 
designs given in the thesis, the results satisfied are concluded below: 
1.  The first design of 16-bit adder proves that the documented theory Jackson and 
Talwar approach presented in the paper рHigh Speed Binary Additionс can be 
practically applied to all the stages in designing of an adder. A 16- bit adder is 
designed implementing Jackson and Talwar approach is designed considering the 
bit groups of 8*8 and the valency of 2*3*2. In this adder the method used 
factorises a kill bit from every stage further reducing the complexity of the carry 
term thus making the critical path faster in a circuit designed. Reducing the 
complexity of the critical path increases the complexities of other terms but these 
complexities can be unbiased following a faster adder. As an obtained result this 
16- bit adder was proven to be smaller and faster than Knowles 16- bit adder. 
Knowles 16-bit adder is the conventional design used for adder presently.  
2. Second design of an adder implements Jackson and Talwar Approach merging with 
Sparse-4 carry tree. It is a 16- bit adder designed with valency 2*3*2 and with the 
bit group configuration of 4*6*6 from LSB to MSB. By using the Sparse-4 carry 
tree in this Jackson and Talwar adder design the carry group in this adder is derived 
from every fourth bit position which reduces the fan-out of carries in the carry tree 
logic. As a result this 16 пbit adder came out to be relatively faster and smaller as 
compared to my first design of 16- bit designed with Jackson and Talwar approach. 
 
3. Third design of 16- bit adder implements Sparse-2 carry tree. This adder was 
designed to examine whether Sparse-2 carry tree can be implemented or not as 
Sparse-2 carry tree is not proposed yet by anyone in this field. This 16- bit adder is 
designed by taking bit groups as 8*8 from LSB to MSB and the valency of 2*3*2 
again. So now the Sparse-2 carry tree was examined but also the bit groups 
configuration was chosen to be different than the previous Sparse-4 carry tree 
adder. The carry in this adder was taken from every second bit position instead of 
every fourth bit position. As a result the number of gates utilised for designing 
were reduced but it did not have much effect on delay as compared to Jackson and 
Talwar adder described the first 16- bit adder design. Thereby concluding that 
Sparse-2 carry tree is not better than Sparse-4 carry tree as the results obtained 
showed same size of second and third designs and also the delay calculated was 
more than Sparse-4 carry tree i.e second 16- bit adder design. 
 
4. While designing the adder it was observed that using low valency cells give better 
reduction in fan-out between the carry generated groups. Also low valency cell 
contributes in reducing the overall size of an adder by decreasing the amount of 
load used for driving gate.  
The graph shown below declares the improvement gained in the designs starting from 
Knowles adder till Jackson and Talwar adder design merged with Sparse-4 carry tree 
method. Graph comparing the progress of Knowles, Ling, Jackson and Talwar ,

7 Future work: 
? The design of 16- bit adder can be implemented at architectural level testing the 
functionality of a design using languages like C or system Verilog language for 
hardware description.  
? EDA tool can be used to simulate the new adder designs laid out with the 
appropriate placement of logic cells used and the net-list of the design can be 
obtained. Using the net-list and various desired constraints a layout of a adder 
design can be generated. 
? The obtained designs can be further tested for Power as power consumption is an 
important parameter and is not been discussed upon. 
? Adder with wider number of bits like 24 bits or 32 bits can be designed by again 
merging Jackson and Talwar approach with sparse tree. The methods, Jackson and 
Talwar approach and sparse tree have much more further scope of optimization 
which will be helpful in designing adders.  
? The fast adders can be further used in digital signal processing , graph 
computations etc.
