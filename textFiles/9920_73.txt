The Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a non-traditional method of machine control 
that has the potential to revolutionise the gaming industry. However, we have little 
fundamental understanding of the speed and accuracy with which users can control 
virtual objects using only the excitement levels of their brain. This research conducts 
a series of studies to investigate the use of BCI techniques in the context of gaming.  
• We first investigated the accuracy with which users could select multiple 
visual states. Five states were found to be the most comfortable and users 
were able to move quickly in both directions (relaxation/excitement).  
• In a second study, we found that users take a linearly increasing amount of 
time to increase and decrease their level of excitement.  
• Finally, we investigated the practicalities of simultaneously controlling an 
avatar with traditional input and fighting a daemon with a BCI. Experienced 
users were more accurate in this parallel input task than novices.  
• Based on these experimental results we discuss several game design 
principles.

Introduction n 
The availability of off-the-shelf Electroencephalography (EEG) kits (such as the 
Emotiv Epoc Neuroheadset and OCZ Neural Impulse Actuator - NIA) has made it 
possible to explore novel Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) for applications ranging 
from gaming [46] to cursor control [32]. EEG senses the underlying states of brain 
activity by interpreting the cortical potentials [33]. Researchers have demonstrated 
the capability of EEG based computer controllers through different point-designs and 
in a number of applications [33-19]. Examples range from using an EEG signal for 
classifying user tasks [1] to controlling a wheelchair [17]. 
A common feature with most of these applications is their use of a sensed brain 
signal to manipulate a spatial parameter, such as moving a virtual cursor [32] or 
even a physical ball in different directions [46]. However, there exist only limited 
generic design principles to guide application developers in mapping a sensed 
parameter, such as the amount of excitement, to virtual control. For example, we do 
not know how many discrete levels of emotional arousal/excitement can be 
comfortably controlled.

Different sensed parameters have been explored in the literature ranging from  
engagement [34] to relaxation [46]. In this research we focus primarily on deriving 
design principles based on emotional excitement as captured by the EEG signals. 
We conducted a systematic investigation into the parameters that can affect user 
control of an on-screen object. We implemented three experiments—two exploring 
the parameters related to one dimensional selection and one gaming scenario that 
require both traditional input and the use of a BCI. 
From these experiments we observed that (a) users can comfortably control five 
discrete levels of cursor movement with brain excitement; (b) the time taken to move 
to a particular level of excitement is proportional to the distance of the target; and (c) 
that the direction of control is uniform (it is as easy for users to relax than to get 
excited). In a final experiment we immersed the users in a multi-tasking scenario, 
analogous to one found in video games. In this environment, users were asked to 
use a wireless remote and BCI input to move an avatar and destroy a demon. Most 
users were capable of multitasking but experienced users were more accurate at 
completing this task, confirming further the guidelines we derived from our results. 
The main contributions of this research are:  
1. A systematic exploration of various parameters that influence mappings of 
EEG signals to virtual cursor control. 
2. Quantifying the number of discrete levels that can be controlled via 
excitement states from EEG input. 
3. A series of guidelines for designers 
4. A demonstration of the practical value of our mappings in a gaming 
application.

Chapter 1: Background and related works 
Human brain is made of approximately 100 billion nerve cells called neurons [1]. 
These neurons communicate with each other using electrical and chemical 
messages. Advances in cognitive neuroscience and brain imaging techniques have 
shown that by measuring these electrical signals (5-100µV) [1] it is possible to 
translate human thoughts and intentions to controlling signals. 
A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a system which by sensing vital 
activities of brain such as electrical signals tries to understand 
underlying state of the brain (without relying on the normal output 
pathway of nervous system) [1]. 
The result of implementing such systems is rewarding in different areas like: 
• People with severe motor disabilities [7].  
• Supporting biofeedback1 training for people suffering from epilepsy, stroke or 
AHDH2 [7]. 
• New input control for computer games enthusiasts [7]. 
• Valuable information for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) experts [1, 25].

As a matter of fact, much of the BCI real applications to date have been developed 
to help people with limited movement skills [4], however, several efforts were made 
to make BCI an applicable approach for normal people. Unfortunately most of these 
efforts have failed due to lack of insight or ignoring technological boundaries.  
Up to the present time, BCI falls short of being a valuable approach for normal 
people, mostly because of its limitations, like low bandwidth of input compared with 
other type of inputs (e.g. keyboard) [3], low accuracy, expensive hardware, 
unfamiliar shapes, and usually long preparation time. Nevertheless, there are 
situations where uses of BCI systems seem applicable and promising. Some of 
these situations are listed below [8]: 
• Induced Disability: Situations where hand or voice communication is not 
possible. (Surgeons, soldiers, etc.)  
• Confidentiality: The nature of BCI is such that makes it the most private 
communication channel ever. 
• Otherwise Unavailable Information: As an example, real-time error 
recognition could be done by understanding the user’s brain state. 
• Novelty: Of course using this technology is exciting and it can attract some 
users to use it. 
Despite all the above interesting possible usages, it should be pointed out that there 
are some issues which hinder the everyday use of BCI systems. 
One reason for the limited usages of BCI systems is the lack of knowledge about 
abilities, capabilities, and preferences of human brain in controlling its outputs. In 
fact, even it is not identified that to what extent human brain is able to control its 
outputs. One area of research which could help to make BCI systems ready to use in 
everyday lives is to identify these characteristics of human brain in order to discover 
ways that the brain is able or prefers to control itself. 
From a speculative point of view, traditional input controls are based on movements 
of human body, the skills learnt from the very beginning of life, whereas controlling 
brain is something into which the scientists have started to research recently. Hence, 
there is not that much idea about the possible ways of mapping intensions to actions. 
However, it is hoped to discover good mapping methods regarding users’ experience 
of movement which is a reflection of their intensions. 
Introduction to BCI Systems 
Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a new emerging field which tries to make a direct 
interface between human brain and computers. BCI is a multi-disciplinary domain 
formed by cooperation of scientists in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, 
Medical Engineering, Neuroscience, Bioengineering, and even Art. Therefore, for 
understanding its abilities and capabilities a perspective of this field with its variety of 
domains should be depicted.

Page 5 
A BCI system usually consists of 3 major parts [7], signal acquisition, feature 
extraction, and feedback mechanism. There are several methods and techniques 
tailored for answering responsibilities of each part. Regarding to combination of 
methods used for each part, the characteristics of the BCI system will be changed. 
Hence, a decent level of knowledge about each part is necessary. 
Methods used in signal acquisition part are divided into two categories of invasive 
and non-invasive methods. In the former, an array of electrodes is placed in the 
cortex layer of the subject’s brain to record neural firing of neurons (Figure 2). 
Since there is a need for brain surgery in invasive approaches, the trend amongst 
researchers for acquisition of brain signals have not been for using these methods. 
However, very interesting works have been done using invasive methods like 
controlling a wheelchair by a completely locked-in user [17], or controlling a robotic 
arm by rats and monkeys [16]. Nevertheless, in some recent research it has been 
proven that it is possible to reach the same level of accuracy and performance of 
invasive methods by implementing a non-invasive approach [9].  
 
Figure 2: A matrix of electrodes installed in the cortex layer3. 
None-invasive approach is based on the fact that a variety of vital signs can be 
sensed from outside of the scalp. However, there are different kinds of sensors for 
collecting these vital signs. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and Electroencephalograph (EEG) 
are three well-known methods of collecting signals from outside of the scalp. 
fMRI senses the magnetic field around the scalp, while fNIRS measures the 
concentration of blood oxygen using infrared light [31]. fMRI is an effective technique 
for brain function imaging in medical science. However, it is vulnerable to the 
existence of metal objects and head movements [31], both of which are common

when using a computer. For this reason, it is not favoured by BCI researchers. fNIRS 
has low temporal resolution making it challenging to detect fast responses after an 
event happened [35]. This precludes real-time interaction for controlling GUI-based 
systems.  
 
Figure 3: Installation of non-invasive electrodes on scalp4. 
Electroencephalograph (EEG) is the most practical method of non-invasive signal 
acquisition used extensively in the labs [10]. The reason for using EEG as the signal 
acquisition method is not that strong. In fact, because of the impracticality of other 
approaches, EEG is considered as the most reasonable solution. 
EEG is based on measuring sensible electrical potential caused by brain activities 
[25]. In order to measure these voltages a number of electrodes must be sited on the 
fixed places on the scalp (Figure 4). The electrode placed exactly in the middle of the 
scalp ( in Figure 4) is usually selected as the reference point of voltage; hence 
there are 64 possible independent channels for measuring EEG signals.

Figure 4: Standard placements of electrodes5. 
As it is clear from Figure 3 and 4, connecting 65 electrodes to users scalp could not 
be a practical solution. In the recent studies researchers have tried to reduce the 
number of electrodes compulsory for performing a task. Fortunately, using 
sophisticated techniques, they have shown that it is possible to reach adequate level 
of accuracy using only a small fraction of these electrodes (e.g. 3 [1], 9 [25], 16 [30] 
electrodes). It is not surprising that most of these ingenious techniques are based on 
machine learning algorithms used in the feature extraction part of the BCI systems.  
However, there is a very big obstacle which hinders the way in which the EEG 
signals are used. It is the noise problem. In addition to lack of easy procedure for 
EEG measurements [3], the electrical potentials caused by brain interactions are 
really tiny. Hence, the EEG sensors must be really sensitive to be able to sense EEG 
signals (gain of amplifier which is used for EEG system is around 20,000 [1]) and as 
a result various things can affect the output signal of signal acquisition component.  
• Some of these noises are caused by the nature of non-invasive signal 
acquisition. Separation of the electrodes from the source of electrical activity 
because of blood, bones, skin, and hairs [1, 25] is unavoidable.

• Body movements are another source for noises. Body movements of person 
who is the subject of an experiment may cause very small vibration in 
electrodes, or change blood pressure, or even change the effect of gravity on 
the brain cells and these small changes may cause an undesirable noise on 
the signals [27]. 
• EEG signals cannot be separated from the Electromyography (EMG) signals. 
EMG signals are signals that are produced by electrical activity of skeletal 
muscles. Facial expressions, blinking, and eye movements are the most usual 
EMG related noises that appear on EEG signals [26]. 
• In case of using wires to connect EEG sensors to computer, electric potentials 
of wires can affect each other. Also movements of wires could cause noise in 
the output.  
• In case of using wireless solutions for making the connection between device 
and its base, wireless radiations is another source of noise on EEG signals. 
• EEG based BCI systems, as a practical solution, can work in a normal 
environment (e.g. an office). There are different sources of noise in a normal 
environment that can affect the EEG signals. Some examples are: computer 
hum, indoor power lines, florescent lights, electrical charges, mobile devices 
signals, Wi-Fi signals etc. 
• Different mental states could also be considered as noise. For example if the 
goal of BCI system is to detect whether user is frustrated or not, other 
emotions such as drowsiness or happiness could have an effect on the 
signals. 
Therefore, noise is a big factor in EEG based BCI systems and removing it from the 
EEG signal is extremely difficult. 
Despite these obstacles, the results of research have been good and unexpected. 
There are many methods which can be used to minimise the effect of noise. Some of 
these methods try to purify the signals and some of them try to ignore the noises and 
keep working with noisy data. However, both of these methods rely on signal 
processing techniques.   
Therefore, signal processing and machine learning algorithms play key roles in the 
practicality of BCI systems. The two major ways of processing EEG signals are 
monitoring Self-Regulatory Activities and Event Related Potentials (ERP) [10]. In 
self-regulatory activity approach slow cortical potentials or changes in cortical 
rhythms is the subject of the feature extraction, while the focus of the second 
technique is on the detection of the effect of a stimulus on user’s brain waves.  
The advantage of ERP approach is that it does not need any training data for feeding 
into its classifier; in fact it just relies on natural responses of human brain [10]. There 
are also some other techniques which are derived from ERP, for example visual 
Evoked Potential (VEP) and Steady State VEP (SSVEP) [11] are two well-known 
techniques which work similarly to ERP. 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 9 
As a matter of fact the study of signal processing of BCI systems is not within the 
scope of this project. However, in a case study of practical BCI systems some of the 
relatively successful signal processing methods will be discussed in brief.  
Feedback mechanism and selecting a mental strategy is the last building block of a 
BCI system. Mental strategy is the way that BCI system tries to stimulate something 
in the user’s brain and feedback mechanism looks for the effect inside his/her brain 
waves. Similar to previous parts there are several methods for doing this job, two 
most prominent are Operant Conditioning and Pattern Recognition.  
The difference between these two techniques from user’s point of view is that the 
Operant Conditioning forces him/her to learn how to control his/her brain waves, 
while Pattern Recognition put the burden of learning on the BCI system itself [1].  
Operant Conditioning requires that the user first train the system and then operates 
the application by repeating the same thoughts whereas Pattern Recognition uses 
signal processing and machine learning techniques to reveal the mental states or 
activities of untrained users.  
Pattern recognition became more interesting when researchers found that imaginary 
body movements produce the same brain signals as the real ones [7]. As a result, it 
is possible to create a BCI based game which by imaginary foot and hand 
movements an agent walks [32] and punches.  
In Pattern recognition, when the BCI system wants to know about mental state of the 
user, it picks some small amount of brain waves and tries to find out to which mental 
state this new signal belongs. It is obvious that because of the noise and many other 
technical issues signals cannot be exactly like each other, hence the output of the 
classifier is a number which represents the similarity of that signal to a category. But 
how much similarity to a category means that the mental state of the user belongs to 
that category? 
In order to answer this question, scientists usually use statistical methods. For 
instance they calculate the mean and standard deviation of similarity parameter for 
training data, then by using these two statistical parameters calculate a threshold 
which helps to indicate to which category a signal belongs [21]. One possible way of 
calculating threshold can be seen in the following equation: 
Threshold = µ + k.? 
Where µ is the mean, ? is the standard deviation of similarity for training data and k 
is a constant factor. 
Finally, with regards to BCI systems, it should be borne in mind that the presence of 
feedback is an essential element in them. Therefore, a BCI system should be placed 
in a closed-loop (Figure 5) [1]. A closed loop causes that when a BCI system makes 
a change in the environment that user is interacting with, some detectable effects 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 10 
trigger in the brain of user, which the BCI system will be able to make new changes 
in the environment according to the responses received from brain waves and so on.  
 
Related works 
Electroencephalography (EEG)—the recording of electrical activity along the scalp 
caused by the firing of neurons—was invented a century ago [1]. Neuroscientists 
have shown that it is possible to understand the underlying states of the brain by 
sensing the vital activities of the brain through electrical signals that were caused by 
firing neurons in the cortex layer.  
A logical progression of this understanding has been to use this output to control 
computing machinery leading to the creation of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) 
research field which has a number of interesting applications. These include, new 
input methods for people with severe motor disabilities [15], extracting emotional and 
cognitive user states from users whilst interacting with computing machinery [5], 
facilitating real-time interface adaptation based on the user’s cognitive states [28], 
and augmenting traditional input controls with an additional emotional state, such as 
for computer games6. 
However one fact had been ignored about nature of this input controller in the first 
stages. Basically the amount of data that can be transferred from computer’s normal 
terminals to human brain is significantly larger than the highest possible bandwidth 
that can be imagined from brain to computer [6]. In addition, technological limitations 
such as noise, high cost of sensitive sensors, and impracticality of having isolated 
environment [1, 4] forced researchers to look for new applications for EEG based 
BCI systems. 
As regards this point the trend has recently shifted towards using systems which use 
EEG signals along other inputs [5] or systems which use EEG signals for 
understanding the state of the user (not for directly controlling something by the

user). Effectively, the later approach called passive usage of BCI systems is more 
interesting for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) designers [2, 4].  
As it was mentioned already, applications of BCI technology which can be 
categorised as passive method are mostly interesting for HCI researchers. Using 
cognitive state of users for understanding their interaction with an interface [5], 
classifying the task which is being done by users according to their brain waves [1], 
and designing Attentive User Interface (AUI) which tries to maximise the focus of the 
user with regard to attentive resources of the system and the user [2] are three 
successful examples of using passive BCIs.  
The fact that makes passive method interesting for HCI researchers is that BCI is 
able to supply some information which either was not accurate enough such as 
measurement of workload caused by interacting with an interface, or was not 
accessible before such as real-time recognition of emotions. This potential makes 
HCI researchers eager to find new ways that measure different factors such as 
memory workload, task engagement, satisfaction, and frustration using passive BCIs 
[1].  
Traditional metrics for user interface designers such as task completion time or error 
rate are worthy parameters for measuring quality of an interface. However, none of 
these parameters give any information about more complex factors such as cognitive 
workload of user.  
For example, user interface designers always try to minimise the workload of the 
user while working with an interface. In other word, the goal that HCI experts pursue 
is to make the user interface as transparent as possible for its users [26]. However, 
measuring transparency of a user interface is somehow impossible. This is due to 
the fact that there is no traditional way to measure the workload that user interface 
has caused apart from the workload of the task itself. However, by using BCI 
methods this measurement could be done [26].  
To date, most of the techniques that can supply some information about state of the 
user are based on observation of user actions. This technique works because there 
is a relation between mind and body. However, it is essential not to ignore the fact 
that this relation is not direct, hence the comprehension gained by these 
observations will be indirect as well [25]. Therefore, finding ways that convey some 
information about state of the user from a direct medium have become very 
important for HCI experts [1].  
For example, one device which is used in HCI experiments extensively is eye 
tracking devices which can give some information about the interface or the device 
which is being used by the user. However, unfortunately, it cannot distinguish 
whether the user is really engaged with that device or interface, or simply he/she is 
just looking at them [2]. The advantage of using BCI techniques in HCI is that they 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 12 
are searching for the state of the user source of intelligent and awareness rather 
than guessing it from its signs [1]. 
In addition to these typical usages, BCI systems might help us to understand the way 
that the human brain interacts with a user interface and might make it possible to 
improve user interfaces in a way that they are more compatible with the natural 
pathway of our thinking [22].  
 
Figure 6: Process of making an adaptive user interface (Taken from reference [28]). 
In addition to this helpful information, there are other benefits in using BCI systems. 
For instance it has not been possible to have a user interface able to adapt itself to 
the preferences of its users. The most important reason is that the process of 
measurement and consequently the process of evaluation of output measurement 
were not automatic before. BCI suggests solutions for writing software that can 
measure suitability of its own interface and then change it dynamically with regards 
to the preferences of its users (Figure 6).  
To show capability of BCI systems for making adaptive user interfaces, it is possible 
to take a look at the applications developed with this idea in mind. The first example 
is applications which are able to understand frustration of users in doing a task and 
try to show some guidance on the underlying task [23]. And the second instance of 
using this paradigm is an application which is able to understand level of 
concentration of user and not to disturb him/her by sending unimportant interruptions 
[2]. 
Another domain which is really suitable for BCI system is game development. 
Computer games have progressed from keyboard and joystick input to rich physical 
movements (such as the Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect). The expectation is that 
future games would take advantage of BCI input to increase the user’s involvement.

The incorporation of BCI input technology into games can be categorized into three 
different groups: traditional games with BCI input, non-traditional games with BCI 
input, and games with BCI assisted input. 
Traditional games with BCI input. These games were designed for more traditional 
forms of input (like keyboard or mouse) but have been adapted to utilize BCI as the 
only input control for the game. By controlling different cognitive states, gamers can 
walk through and play the game without the assistance of their hands. Examples of 
these games include the walking game [20], or playing Ping-Pong using a BCI 
controller7. 
Non-traditional games with BCI input. The BCI input for ‘non-traditional’ games 
affords the design of conceptually different games to those possible with traditional 
input mechanisms. For example, these games may utilize BCI capabilities to help 
players improve their mental awareness. As an example, in Brainball, gamers must 
relax in order to win the game [19]. 
BCI-input assisted games. The third group augments BCI input with traditional 
input control to provide a richer experience. For example, if the user is frustrated 
when attempting to complete a task, the game could assist the player, or if their level 
of engagement is not adequate, the game difficulty could be elevated [23]. Another 
example is Mindflex (mindflexgames.com) a game that requires users to navigate a 
ball through an obstacle course. The height of the ball is controlled by excitement 
while the movement in other directions is controlled by a knob.  
Also, in addition to attempts to enrich games by BCI technology some companies 
have tried to produce commercial input controllers using this exciting technology. 
These products can be considered as two major groups. The first group consist of 
controllers which are produced to have same abilities as traditional input controls, 
and the second one consist of devices which are more like a novel game console. In 
the following section an example of both groups are given. 
BCI in Practise 
In this part, methods of collecting, analysing and mapping of data in 
practical BCI systems are discussed. Selecting the case studies, 
their relations to the objectives of this project and coverage of the 
contents of previous parts have also been carefully considered. 
P300, A Well-known Selection technique 
P300 response is one neurological phenomenon that can be measured using EEG 
signals and pattern recognition. P300 can be considered as a composite index of 
both attention and memory [1]. It is based on detecting a specific type of EEG signal 
which peaks at around 300ms (but could be up to 900ms) after presenting a 
stimulus. The amplitude of a P300 signal is changed with the target's higher

probability and lower discriminability and P300 latency decreases when targets are 
easier to distinguish [36].  
In order to use this method selectable items start to flash over a period of time on 
screen and users are asked to count the number of times an object of interest 
flashes to help them focus on the object and improve the P300 signal [13]. In result, 
the amount of time taken to select an option depends on the number of items in the 
list can be relatively high [12] (e.g. consider a speller with letters, numbers, and 
important keys like backspace, space, and enter as options).  
In order to improve the performance of this method, there is a method known as “N-
chromatic technique” [13] which is based on decision trees. This technique suggests 
putting options in a 2 dimensional matrix (Figure 7). In this technique rows and 
columns start to flash instead of selectable items. Using a simple decision tree, it is 
possible to identify which item is selected in a more reasonable time.  
P300 has been widely used in various areas such as to improve the life of patients 
who cannot move or communicate but are still aware and awake [4].  Further 
examples include playing a virtual piano [16] or selecting different objects on a multi-
touch screen [15]. However, due to its low performance and accuracy, P300 control 
remains an inconvenient input choice for the normal user [37].  
The data collecting method and analysing the signals in P300 are based on ERP 
method [11]. One characteristic of P300 technique which helps to ignore noise and 
other stimulus is that if it is considered as a graph of finite states, the transition 
between states is possible only in specific times [13] (300ms to 900ms after a 
stimulus).

Figure 7: P300 table while the second row is flashing. 
As it was mentioned before, in order to select an item, user should focus on a 
character of his own choice. Then as a consequence the rows and columns of the 
matrix start to flash (Figure 7). If one considers a flash of row or column in Figure 7 
as an event, there are 11 events in the system (5 columns + 6 rows). However, when 
user’s attention is focused on just a one cell, only 2 (1 column + 1 row) events out of 
11 possible events have an effect on the brain waves [11]. 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 15 
By recognising related events, P300 signal processing unit would try to narrow down 
the state space of the options and finally select one as the selected option. In order 
to process signals for extracting their features, usually signals are broken down into 
some windows which contain the important part of the signal. In P300 the important 
part of the signals usually starts from 220ms after stimuli and ends in 500ms [11].  
Four different features are used for signal processing and finding the effect of stimuli 
on brain waves in a simple P300 system [11]: 
1. Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis (SWDA): Before the start of 
process, it calculates the mean of a group of trial windows. While the 
selecting process is running it collects sample windows from EEG signals 
and measures the distance of each epoch of them. Using these parameters, 
it assigns a score to each window. 
2. Peak Picking: The difference between the lowest negative and the highest 
positive points in a window is another feature that is used for signal 
classification. 
3. Area: The area under the signal can be seen as another feature that can be 
extracted from each window for classification. 
4. Covariance: A template of an ideal signal which depicts the effect of stimuli 
is derived from a set of training data. Covariance of this template and the 
real-time signal can be used as another feature for classification. 
Using a combination of above algorithms, a score is assigned to each cell of the 
matrix. After repeating the above procedure a number of times, the cell that has the 
highest score should be the selected cell by the user. 
The reason that four different features have been used for classification is quite 
ingenious. Actually this set of four features covers each other’s disadvantages and 
make it possible to recognise P300 signals with more accuracy.  
Covariance and SWDA are somehow the same. Both of them compute the similarity 
of signal to a template; however SWDA is more effective than covariance because it 
gives more weight to effective points in the signal. The disadvantage is that both of 
these features are sensitive to the latency of the effect of stimuli. It means that if an 
effect of a stimulation delayed in the signal, both of the features will assign low 
scores to it [11].  
On the other hand Pick Peaking is not sensitive to latency but it ignores a great deal 
of other useful information in the signal. Finally Area feature considers all the points 
but ignores shape of the signal which helps to ignore noises [11]. By giving a good 
weight to score of each feature it is possible to achieve satisfactory results.

NIA8, an EEG Based Input Controller for Gaming 
One commercial EEG based input controller which is available for game players and 
researchers is NIA by OCZ Technologies9. NIA is based on a non-commercial device 
known as Cyberlink-Brainfingers by Brain Actuated Technologies10. 
NIA, because of its fancy look (Figure 8) and robust functionalities has gained some 
attentions from game players. By a quick search on the web one can find several 
reviews and videos about this device in different communities. The point which is 
emphasised in nearly all of the reviews is that using this device is like something that 
one has never experienced before. 
 
 
Figure 8: NIA controller by OCZ Technologies (Taken from OCZ website) 
NIA is a relatively inexpensive (i.e. about 140$) BCI system which can be used by 
game players. Beside reasonable price, there are other factors that make this device 
an important example of commercial BCI systems. Most important features of NIA 
that make it one step ahead of its competitors are: 
• Sensible looking which does not make player like an alien. 
• It needs nearly no preparation time  
• The injection of conductive gels on its sensors is not needed. 
• It delivers an amazing experience by only 2 channels (One sensor is 
reference). 
Of course, in addition to these benefits it has some disadvantages as well. The most 
important one is flexibility of its usage. NIA is designed in a way that it can sense

facial expression related signals better than other signals. Moreover, users reported 
facial expressions have to be really exaggerated for being detected by NIA, making it 
a bit hard to use for a long time [14]. 
Emotiv11 Epoc Neuroheadset, an EEG Based Gaming Console 
Epoc Neuroheadset is another EEG based input controller which due to its online 
application store can be considered as a game console. Moreover, Epoc 
Neuroheadset has much functionality which makes it an ultimate device to be used 
for research purposes. Because of these reasons this headset had been used for the 
purpose of this project. Hence this device is described in more depth.  
As Figure 9 shows the Epoc Neuroheadset is relatively more complicated than NIA. 
Not only does it cover all the functionalities of NIA but it is also able to deliver a 
number of more interesting functionalities. Specification of the device in the user 
manual is as follows [30]: 
• 16 saline sensors (14 channels, two of which are reference sensors). 
• A gyroscope is embedded in the device for detecting head movements. 
• Wireless communication gives users the opportunity of free movement. It also 
can be helpful for reducing noises. 
• Sampling rate is around 128Hz. 
The device is relatively expensive (300$ for the headset, research suite costs 750$) 
but still affordable. It should not be forgotten that if one wants to play with a device at 
the cutting edge of technology, for example a jetpack, one has to consider selling 
one’s house or robbing a bank to be able to pay for that [30].

Page 18 
The process of setting up -when you take the device out of the box for the first time- 
is not that difficult, however it is time consuming. It takes nearly 10 minutes to setup 
the device for the first use. After wearing the headset it should be checked that 
sensors are sited in their places. Fortunately there is a control panel which shows 
whether each electrode is sited in correct position or not (Figure 10). However it still 
takes around 5 minutes to place all the electrodes in their correct position to get a 
good signal quality. 
 
Figure 10: Electrodes positions on scalp. Green colour is the indicator of well-placed 
electrode. 
Epoc can detect and respond to three kinds of actions; in fact Epoc has three 
different suites for playing around its abilities, Cognitiv suite, Expressiv suite, and 
Affectiv suite (Emotiv drops the letter ‘e’ at the end of the words. No orthographic 
errors here) [29]. 
Cognitiv Suite 
Actually the most interesting feature of this controller for game players is in Cognitiv 
Suite. Cognitiv suite is able to recognise13 distinct actions, 6 directional movements 
(push, pull, left, right, up, down), 6 rotational movements (clockwise, counter-
clockwise, left, right, forward, backward) and one imaginary movement (disappear). 
For understanding each action, it needs 10 second training data related to each 
action. 
In order to use this suite, user should teach the classifier by a sample brain wave 
which is associated with a specific movement. Then in order to trigger the action 
detection algorithm, user should be able to produce the same brain wave again.  
By trying and exercising to produce the same brain waves for an action, user will be 
able to improve his/her ability to control. However, this ability of Emotiv 
Neuroheadset is not that suitable for most of users, most of users do not want to  
spend hours to learn to control their brain waves. 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 19 
 
Figure 11: A snapshot from Cognitiv Suite control panel. 
The irony about Cognitiv Suite is that the mental strategy and feedback mechanism 
that it uses is Pattern recognition, the goal of which is to put the burden of learning 
on the BCI system. However, in order to use Cognitiv Suite, users must spend 
considerable amount of time to be able to control their brain waves. 
On the other hand it should be mentioned that this failure is not only because of bad 
implementation of Cognitiv Suite. In fact, the task of focusing on the desired mental 
state is nearly impossible for a beginner and if a user cannot produce same brain 
waves, it is not possible to recognise that by any mean.   
Expressiv Suite 
Expressiv Suite can detect facial expressions like wink, laugh, blink, raise brow, 
smile, etc. This suite does not need any training data to detect users’ facial 
expression. However there is a sensitivity panel that enables users to customise the 
threshold being used for recognising the signal patterns (right panel in Figure 12).  
The quality of functionalities that Expressiv Suite delivers is much better than the 
Cognitiv Suite. Of course there is some random facial expressions detection; 
however a fair critic would not say that it is a random response. Also all of the 
possible facial expressions which are recognised by Expressiv Suite are working 
together and it does not need to limit the usage to some of them. 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 20 
 
Figure 12: A snapshot from Expressiv Suite control panel. 
This Suite is not very precise in detecting facial expressions due to minor differences 
of EEG signals on different persons. In order to solve this problem, Expressiv Suite 
enables users to tweak the sensitivity of each facial expression to make it more 
precise. However, it causes a longer preparation time which is not suitable in some 
cases.  
Affectiv Suite 
Affectiv Suite makes it possible to trace the emotions of user such as 
engagement/boredom, instantaneous excitement, long term excitement, frustration 
and meditation. The ability of recognising emotions in Affectiv Suite is completely 
satisfactory and without any prior adjustment or training is able to understand 
emotions of a new user. Moreover, the precision of its detections improves while 
user is working with it for a period of time. 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 21 
 
Figure 13: A snapshot from Affectiv Suite. 
In our pilot studies and tests we found that controlling meditation is usually very hard 
which was somehow predictable. Also, long term excitement is just a regression on 
instantaneous excitement on a specific period of time which makes it slow to 
response. Engagement/Boredom as another emotion that can be detected by Emotiv 
kit is hard to control for some users, and for all users it was nearly impossible to 
reach to the both ends of emotion range. Also, values corresponding to each Suite 
are floating-point numbers between 0 and 1 that shows the percentage of similarity 
of one’s state to a specific emotion or action. 
Mind Balance, a Game with EEG Based Input Controller  
Mind Balance is a relatively simple 2-dimensional BCI game which utilises EEG 
signals as traditional input controllers. The objective of this game is to help a virtual 
agent to walk on a tightrope without falling down. The tightrope walking character 
walks towards the player on a rope and each 1.5 to 5 seconds bends on one side 
which is chosen randomly. The task of player is to change the balance of agent in 
order to help him to remain on the tightrope [10]. 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 22 
 
Figure 14: A snapshot from “Mind Balance” (Taken from reference [18]). 
The method of controlling the agent is fairly simple and it does not need long training 
time. There are two checkerboards (Figure 14) on each side of the character; player 
can change the balance of tightrope walking character by looking at those 
checkerboards. 
The method of signal processing is similar to P300 approach. It is based on causing 
two separate stimulations and searching brain waves to find the effect of one of 
them. The difference from P300 is that the stimuli in this game is steady, in fact 
those checkerboards are two steady signals which are phase reversed. Hence, when 
the user attention is focused on one of them, it is possible for the BCI system to 
understand which checkerboard is being looked at by the player [18]. 
Brainball, an EEG Based Game for Improving Mental Awareness 
Brainball is a game designed by “The Interactive Institute”12. The importance of 
Brainball is that it created a new paradigm of game playing using capabilities of EEG 
technologies. Due to its fascinating parameters, Brainball is the most successful BCI 
game to date [19]. The factor which makes Brainball bold among other BCI games is 
that it works with the level of relaxation of its users.

Figure 15: Brainball Game; Players compete in relaxation (Taken from reference [19]). 
In this game two players wearing an EEG equipped headband and sit at two ends of 
a table with the Brainball on top of it (Figure 15). When the game is started the 
Brainball will roll away from the person who is more relaxed to the other end of the 
table. When the Brainball reaches to one end of the table the game is over and the 
person who is next to the ball has lost the game. 
The controversial fact about Brainball is that it is a competition as well as being 
relaxing. Researchers have shown that Brainball does help people to decrease their 
stress level by playing it [24]. Also people who were subject of this research were 
asked about their enthusiasm for playing this game one more time, and not 
surprisingly more than 90% of them were eager to play it again [24].  
In order to understand the underlying method used in feature extraction of this game, 
an abstract level of knowledge about neuroscience is useful. Human brain emits 
some waves which are related to its long term emotions. Researchers have found 
that by measuring these waves it is possible to understand the emotional state of the 
subject. These waves are categorised into four different groups by their range of 
frequency. Also some emotional states have been associated with each frequency 
band [19]: 
• Alpha waves: These waves are in the range of 8 to 13 Hz. In the relaxing 
state, alpha waves are very strong. 
• Beta waves: These waves are usually in the range of 14 to 30 Hz. Beta 
waves are associated with the alert state of brain. In the moments of pressure 
and intense mental activity they can even reach to 50 Hz. 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 24 
• Theta waves: These waves are in the range of 4 to 7 Hz. and can be seen 
during the time of drowsiness. 
• Delta waves: These waves are below the 3.5 Hz and can be seen during 
deep sleep. 
By measuring EEG signals and extracting above waves from brain waves it is 
possible for a BCI system to access some novel parameters such as a measure for 
relaxation.  
Measurement of Suitability 
In order to compare different methods of utilising BCI technologies, some suitability 
measures should be defined. Therefore, selecting measures and finding ways for 
extracting them from the data collected during experiments is another part of this 
research.  
One good measure which can be used in comparison of two BCI systems is 
performance. However performance has a broad meaning, for instance performance 
can be translated either as speed of doing a task or accuracy of doing a task [15]. 
Hence the definition of performance will be defined by the aim of the experiment. 
Nevertheless, it is good to keep the fact in mind that performance is not everything 
[21]. Undoubtedly there are some situations where people do not like or want to do a 
task with highest possible performance; sometimes user does a task in a different 
way because he/she simply prefers to do it in that way.  
Research has shown that people like to do their task in a way that they prefer as 
long as it is not 20% slower than the efficient way of doing that task [21]. Thus 
preference is another measure which should be studied alongside with the 
performance. Hence, designing questionnaires to find out the preferences of the 
users of BCI systems is one of the measures that have to be considered. 
Emotions and Decision Making 
Emotion is an individual's state of mind about a complex psychological experience 
based on sensory stimulation [38]. Emotion is externally expressed in terms of 
"affect", such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise and disgust. These were referred 
to as the Big Six emotions [39] and do not include affects such as elevation [40], 
pride [41] or confusion [42], which were reported in the literature. An important 
aspect of emotion is arousal (or sometimes referred to as excitement) which is the 
state of responsiveness to sensory stimulation13. Arousal can be viewed as a call to 
action while affect provides the direction of experience [43]. As emotions can affect 
our actions in the physical world, there is a rich set of possibilities in harnessing 
these emotions in the virtual realm. However, from the review of the literature we 
cannot find generic design principles to guide application developers in mapping a 
sensed parameter.  
                                            
13Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 25 
To gain this understanding we focus primarily on deriving design principles based on 
emotional excitement as captured by the EEG signals; we focus on excitement as 
this refers to the state of responsiveness to sensory stimulation.  
Final word 
Despite the fact that this field is relatively young, outstanding results have been 
achieved until now. In some cases BCI has opened completely new research areas, 
and in some other cases it enriched the existing fields.  
Nevertheless, nearly no one has considered the capabilities of human in control of 
his own mind, thus further improvements in this field bind to understanding these 
capabilities. As it will be discussed in the next chapter, the contribution of this project 
to the BCI domain is to investigate parameters that can make control of an interface 
using brain waves more suitable.

Chapter 2: Project Design 
Factors influencing designs of BCI systems  
There are several factors that need to be considered when designing an EEG based 
system. Here we identify four factors that can guide the design of BCI-based 
systems: EEG emotion, mapping method, selection technique, and visual feedback.  
EEG Emotion  
There are a number of parameters of emotion that can be identified by measuring 
the EEG signals. Typical emotions include Joy, Sadness, Anger, Surprise, Fear, and 
Disgust [39] which can be mapped using machine learning techniques.  
Typically, the centre of a brain's emotions is activated when people make a decision 
[43]. As a result, emotions can affect our decisions in ways unaware to us: thinking 
about the future can raise feelings that consequently affect our actions [44]; we make 
quick choices based on emotional instincts (such as in flight-or-fight situations) [47]; 
decisions based on our emotional states are influenced by gender [48]; and realistic 
decisions are made under the influence of emotions of sadness or desperation [48]. 
Designers must choose an appropriate emotion to map onto their required task. 
Some emotions, such as surprise, may be harder for users to replicate than others or 
be inappropriate for the task at hand (e.g. asking a user to be sad when they are 
winning the game).  
Discretization of Movement Space 
BCI input devices provide a continuous stream of constantly changing brain activity 
along a scale. In the case of the Emotiv Epoc Neuroheadset this scale ranges from 
zero to one. Continuous input control makes immediate use of this input value of 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 27 
parameter control. For example it is possible to use continuous input control to 
enhance-first person shooter games in this way such that if a player is excited, small 
movements which make targeting harder are executed more often. 
However, brain signals often spike and change quickly, making on-screen parameter 
control difficult. To provide more smooth and accurate control, the input range can 
be discretized into a smaller number of values or levels. This has the effect of 
reducing the accuracy required of users to select a specific value along a parameter 
range. Game designers need to balance the number of discrete states with the error 
tolerance desired – large number of states can lead to a finer the level of user control 
but with lower tolerance to fluctuations. To the best of our knowledge there is no 
reported results our how to suitably discretize this space, we investigate this issue in 
our later studies. 
Mapping Method 
The aim of a discrete mapping is to translate a level of human emotion into one 
discrete command. There are at least two types of common mappings that a 
designer could choose: absolute or relative mapping.  
Absolute mapping 
Absolute mapping updates the position of the cursor regardless of the user’s 
previous emotion state. This can be done either linearly or non-linearly. In the 
former, all of the emotion states are given the same weight whereas in the later 
different states afford different weights. In a linear mapping the position of the cursor 
is a direct one-to-one function of the current value of an emotion. Commercial games 
like MindBall (www.mindball.se) and Mindflex (mindflexgames.com) use absolute 
mapping to map the excitement level to the distance of a physical ball which the user 
needs to control as part of a game.  
Relative Mapping 
In this mapping method, the position of the cursor is based on the difference 
between the current and the previous emotional states of the user. This can be 
performed in different ways. One approach is to calculate the distance of two 
consequent emotional states and with a function (linear or non-linear) calculate the 
displacement that should be applied to cursor (e.g. this is based on the operation of 
the computer mouse). Alternatively, the cursor displacement can be calculated 
relative to a neutral state, instead of a previous emotional state. 
Selection Technique 
A selection technique allows users to pick a state after moving the BCI-based cursor 
into the required level. There are two possible ways for selection to occur on BCI 
systems: one is within band, i.e. using BCI capabilities and the other is out-of-band, 
i.e. using a traditional input controller. Examples of techniques that only use BCI 
capabilities include dwelling, hovering upon one state for a number of times, and 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 28 
using another emotion for triggering selection. Examples of the second approach 
include double-clicking on the mouse, a keyboard, or voice recognition.  
Visual Feedback  
Feedback is one of the main building blocks of control systems. It is possible to 
visualize the feedback of a system in different ways according to needs and 
specification of the system. Because feedback is a part of closed control loop, the 
effect of it on the performance of user could be significant. 
Visual feedback is a key component of P300 based systems. Thus different visual 
representations could have different outcomes. For instance, Ramos et. al. [44] 
showed in their study that users performed better with full visual feedback compared 
with spatial feedback. Many BCI-based outputs have been used as control input. 
However, there is little research which investigates how well a user can control these 
input states in different conditions and different forms of representations. We 
conducted some experiments to study these questions.  
Detail of the experimental design 
In order to find which of the above factors can affect suitability of BCI systems for 
users, an iterative process was designed. This process contained design, 
implementation, and pilot test phases. The goal of each step was to improve 
achievements and remove problems of previous phases and iterations. Iterations 
continued until the final version of software got ready for the real experiment. During 
iterations some of our misunderstandings about abilities of users’ brain discovered 
which caused to change some of the objectives of the research. 
In the beginning, suitability of different mapping methods was an interesting topic to 
investigate. The aim of a mapping method is to translate level of human emotion into 
an action. Emotiv kit maps each detectable emotion to a range from 0 to 1; the 
outcome of a mapping method is to map location of a cursor on the screen using this 
value. 
There are two ways for mapping emotions to actions. One is absolute mapping and 
the other one is relative mapping. In order to identify fitness of each mapping method 
one example from each of them developed for comparing performance of users in 
controlling them.  
In order to implement an absolute mapping, a linear absolute mapping method was 
implemented, essentially because the level of accuracy of emotions by users was 
unknown. In that situation using more complex type of mappings (e.g. Non-linear 
absolute mapping) just made analysis of the results more complex than a simple one 
to one mapping. The formula below designed and used for this mapping: 
Cursor = BS(t). d 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 29 
Where BS is Brain State, t is current time, and d is a factor that change dimension of 
brain state to dimension used by cursor (pixels). 
In order to implement a relative mapping, an average state which is average of 
user’s brain state during a period of time was defined. Using average state and 
current value of user’s emotion, a formula designed for changing position of cursor.

Where AS is average state, t is current time, n is period of time for calculating 
average state, BS is Brain State, d is a factor that change dimension of brain state to 
dimension used by cursor (pixels), and c is a constant to make the jumps smaller. 
In the next iterations we found that our knowledge about control of users on their 
emotion is very limited. Because implementation of a good relative mapping function 
needs decent knowledge about inputs of the function, it was decided to just focus on 
absolute mapping method. 
We also designed and developed two selection methods, selection by click and 
selection by dwelling on chosen state. In pilot experiments we found that both of 
them are controllable by user. However in the design of the real experiment we 
found that for collecting enough data points to be able to do statistical analysis we 
need a large number of trials from each user. Because in our opinion selection 
technique had the least importance between other factors, we omitted investigation 
about this factor to reduce the time of experiment to around 1 hour. 
As it discussed before, since comparing accuracy of user on controlling different 
emotions was not a topic of interest for us, we focused on excitement as this refers 
to the state of responsiveness to sensory stimulation.  
In order to control excitement we should define what excitement is precisely first, 
however definition of excitement cannot be found clearly. In everyday use of word 
excitement, it is always coupled with other emotions like excited/angry, 
excited/happy, excited/curious, and more. Moreover, the algorithm which Emotiv 
used for measuring excitement is unknown and proprietary. Hence it was hard to 
discover which form of excitement is detectable by Emotiv. 
In Emotiv documentation it is mentioned that they record brain wave of 2,000 people 
from all around the world to make a universal signature for understanding user’s 
emotion and actions. Collection of universal signature for each emotion suggests 
that they stimulated users to bring them to an emotional state and record their brain 
waves.

Page 30 
The problem in this situation is that reactions of people to a specific stimulus could 
be different. For example imagine that for stimulating people to get excited they 
showed them a card trick. Probably most of people get excited when they see a card 
trick, however type of these excitements are not the same. For example, some 
people may get curious and excited while some other get happy and excited. 
In result, because of vague definition of excitement and also uncertainty about the 
emotional state that Emotiv kit discovers as excitement, we tried different ways to 
understand which emotions can trigger excitement detection algorithm. We 
suggested these ways before experiment sessions to all the participants and let 
them to try and find a way which they are more relaxed with it. 
These ways include thinking about complex things and reasoning about them (doing 
mathematical operation doesn’t help), thinking about a joyful memory or event, 
thinking about a joke or a funny scene, thinking about favourite music, and thinking 
about shocking or surprising situations. 
Also it is mentionable that four participants were not able to control the cursor using 
their excitement at all. In total 30 different participants participated in our 
experiments. In one case we were not able to install the headset properly due to 
small size of skull. However for three other participants we do not have any particular 
scientific reason that why they were not able to control the device. 
Meanwhile a framework which is capable of doing different experiment was 
designed. This framework was developed in C# because (a) Emotive SDK is only 
available in C++ and C#; (b) C# has more convenient features for user interface 
design. Also, because of relatively better performance of Windows Presentation 
Foundation (WPF) than Graphical Device Interface (GDI) in redrawing 2D objects on 
the screen, graphical parts had been developed using this technology. 
Because of importance of logging, responsiveness of application had been 
considered as one of the important issues in the design phase. Hence, along trying 
to improve performance of code, different threads had been mounted for handling 
different tasks.  
Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern had been used for the design of the 
framework. As it can be seen in Figure 18 EEGPresentation package is the View, 
EEGcontroller package is the Controller, and EEGSignalReader, Emotiv and Log 
packages are parts of Model. 
 In the rest of this section class diagram and sequence diagram of the main 
components of the system can be found. These two diagrams cannot be mapped on 
the code entirely, because lots of unimportant data is omitted from them to make it 
more readable. However they are useful for understanding data flow and low level 
design of the program.

In the following sections specification of experiments are described, and then the 
collected data from the experiments are analysed and discussed.  
Experiment 1: Identifying levels of control 
The primary goal of this experiment is to establish the accuracy with which a user 
can manipulate their excitement levels to control an object. A secondary goal was to 
examine the suitability of different types of visual feedback.  
Participants wore the Emotiv Epoc Neuroheadset headset to measure their levels of 
excitement. They were then asked to move a cursor from a starting position to an 
end position by becoming more excited or more relaxed. Since excitement is a 
measure of brain activity, participants were informed that mentally solving complex 
problems or thinking of past memories would stimulate brain activity. 
We divided this study into two parts: 1A and 1B. The experimental setup remained 
identical between the two parts, the conditions and participants were modified, as 
reported at the beginning of experiment 1B.  
Experimental Interface and Task 
The experimental interface (Figure  & 20) had a size of 1280?800 pixels and was 
displayed on a 14 inch widescreen monitor (resolution 1400?900 pixels). Participants 
sat 70cm from the screen (Figure 21). At the beginning of a trial, the start position is 
shaded orange and end state is shaded green. To ready the participant, a three-
second countdown begins (Figure 19). During this time, the end state fades from 
fully shaded to only an outline. Once the countdown completes, the user can move 
the cursor by changing their excitement.

circle shows the start state, green circle shows the end state. 
 
Figure 20: Linear visualizations. User should bring cursor to orange square first. 
Orange square shows the start state, green square shows the end state, and red line 
shows cursor. 
The participants’ initial excitement level must match the start state before a trial 
begins. To achieve this, the participant must modify their excitement level to move 
the cursor into the start state, and keep it at a constant excitement for at least 
200ms, at which point the trial begins (Figure 20). The user then adjusts their 
excitement level to reach the target. Once over the target, the user presses a key on 
a wireless remote (Figure 21) to indicate the end of the trial. Trials are terminated if 
the user requires more than one minute to move and select the target. In this study, 
we use a one-to-one mapping of excitement level cursor position.

Figure 21: Experiment environment. Headset and remote controller can be seen. 
To reduce cursor jitter, we set a threshold for showing cursor movement. If the 
change of excitement was less than that threshold (set at 0.03 in our experiments), 
the cursor became thicker (and faded in colour) (Figure 22). This indicated small 
scale ‘bouncing’ movement to the user. The cursor returned to its normal thin line 
visualization when the user’s excitement settled or if a large scale excitement was 
detected. 
 
Figure 22: the cursor became thicker and faded in colour. 
Procedure 
After completing appropriate consent forms, the Emotive headset was placed on the 
user and their comfort confirmed. Each participant was provided with an explanation 
of the control mechanism—by relaxing they would move the cursor towards the left 
(or centre, depending on the visualization, see below) and by becoming more excited 
they would move the cursor up or outwards. 
Participants were then given ample time to practice the control mechanism with both 
of the visualizations used. Each experiment consisted of 4 blocks of 16 trials. 
Between each block of trials the participant were given the opportunity to rest for 
three minutes. The study took on average 60 minutes per participant, including 
practice time.

Page 36 
Study 1A  
The experiment used a 2?4?2 within-participants design, with factors: 
• Number of states: 5, 10. By increasing the number of states, users should be 
able to more accurately select items from those available.  
• Emotional Distance: +0.29, +0.59, -0.59. Excitement is measured on a linear 
scale from 0 to 1. Emotional distance is a measurement along this scale—
positive distance indicates movement from relaxed to excited, negative 
movement from excited to relaxed.  
• Visualization: Linear, Bull’s-eye. A one-dimensional matrix layout or a bull’s-
eye-like set of concentric circles (see Figure s 19 & 20). 
The factors visualization and number of states were counterbalanced between 
participants. The experiment consisted of four blocks of 16 trials with the 
presentation of distances modified between blocks. 
Participants 
Seven participants (6 male and 1 female) between the ages of 24 and 31 
volunteered for the study. All were from a local university and they had all heard of 
an EEG headset but none of them had used one before. 
Results 
The total number of trials that were successfully completed was 424 out of 448. The 
average trial completion time for successful trials was 12.45 sec (s.e. = 0.54 sec). 
We carried out statistical tests using a univariate ANOVA with Tamhane post-hoc 
pair-wise comparisons (not equal variance assumed) to compare the effect of 
number of states and visualization.

Page 37 
 
Figure 23: Task completion time in sec (up) and false targets selected (down) over 
number of states and visualizations (B = Bull’s-eye visualization, L = Linear 
Visualization) for Study 1A. 
There was a significant effect of number of states on trial completion time (F1,6 = 
39.7, p < 0.01), with five states significantly faster (10.02 sec) than ten states (14.97 
sec). We found no significant effect of number of states on false target selection (F1,6 
= 3.76, p = 0.07)—five states had an average of 3.9 false selections, ten states 4.5. 
Figure  shows the mean task completion time per state for each visualization. 
We found no significant effect of visualization on trial completion time (F1,6 = 0.259, p 
> 0.1, linear = 7.75sec, bull’s-eye = 7.64s) or number of false targets selected (F1,6 = 
0.013, p > 0.1, linear = 0.239, bull’s-eye = 0.233). An exit survey showed no 
differences in user perception of frustration or effort between these two 
visualizations.  
There is a significant effect of distance on trial completion time (F2,18 = 3.66, p = 
0.032) and number of false targets selected (F2,18 = 46.748, p = 0.001). As can be 
seen from Figure 24, post-hoc pair-wise comparisons showed users were 
significantly faster (p < 0.05) at relaxing (-0.59) than getting excited (0.59). They also 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 38 
had significantly fewer false targets selected when going to 0.29 than 0.59. None of 
the other pairs showed significance.

distances for Study 1A (1 = -0.59, 2 = 0.29, 3 = 0.59). 
Study 1B 
In Study 1A we saw that users were significantly faster when selecting from five 
states over ten and that there were less false selections using less states. Based on 
this result, we predicted that users should be even faster when selecting from three 
states over five. We ran Study 1B to test this hypothesis—it was run with an identical 
setup as study 1A, with the number of states and participants differing as 
documented below. 
Setup Differences 
To validate or refute our hypothesis, we modified the levels of the number of states 
factor to three and five. 
An additional seven participants (2 male and 5 female) between the ages of 25 and 
30 were recruited for study 1B. As per experiment 1A, all had heard of an EEG 
headset but none of them had used one before. 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 39 
Results 
The total number of trials that were successfully completed was 420 out of 448. The 
average trial completion time for successful trials was 12.6 sec (s.e. = 0.56 sec). We 
carried out similar statistical tests to study 1A.  
We found no significant effect of number of states on trial completion time (F1,83 = 
0.152, p > 0.05) or number of false targets selected (F1,83 = 2.86, p > 0.05). 
Interestingly, users were marginally faster and selected fewer false targets when 
performing with five states (mean 12.5 sec, 1.84 errors) than with three (mean 12.7 
sec, 2.12 errors) as can be seen from Figure 25. 
As with Study 1A, we found no significant effect of visualization on trial completion 
time (F1,83 = 2.205, p > 0.05). However, we did find a significant effect of visualization 
on number of false targets selected (F1,83 = 5.64, p = 0.02). Users were more 
accurate with the linear visualization (mean 1.85 false selections) than with the 
bull’s-eye visualization (2.12).

Discussion: Study 1A and 1B 
From studies 1A and 1B we learned that the number of states is an important factor 
in the control of an on-screen cursor using BCI input. Our studies showed that five 
states is preferable over ten states, however, we did not show that three states were 
significantly faster than five. We therefore choose five states as a comfortable range 
in which users can move a cursor. We use this value for our remaining studies.  
Experiment 2: Excitement-based Distance control 
Experiment one showed that users were successfully able to move the cursor in 
order to select items on a one-dimensional visualization. In this experiment, we 
sought to investigate the effect of excitement direction and distance in greater detail. 
Experimental Design and Procedure 
The interface, design, and procedure for experiment two are identical to experiment 
one, except as noted below. In this study we manipulated one factor, the selection 
distance. 
Number of states: From the previous two studies we saw that five states was optimal 
for this type of cursor movement and selection task. For this experiment, the number 
of states remained constant at five. 
Visualisation: The first experiment showed that there was no significant difference 
between the selection times for the two visualizations, with study 1B finding the 
linear visualization was more accurate for selection. For this reason, we choose to 
only use the linear visualization.  
Block design: We used four blocks with each block sampling each of the eight 
distances two times. 
Distances: We selected four forward (increasing excitement) and four backward 
(decreasing excitement) distances: +0.2, +0.4, +0.6 +0.8 and -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8 
(see Figure 26). Recall that in a five state condition, a movement of 0.2 equates to 
shifting one state. Where possible, the start position of these distances was also 
varied.

Page 41 
 
Figure 26: Eight different direction and distances used in experiment 2 
Participants 
Seven participants (5 male and 2 female) between the ages of 24 and 27 were 
recruited from a local university to participate in the experiment. All participants had 
heard of an EEG headset but none of them had used one before.  
Results and Discussion 
The total number of trials that were successfully completed was 414 out of 448. The 
average trial completion time for successful trials was 16.22 sec (s.e. = 0.68 sec).  
As one would expect, an ANOVA showed that there was a significant effect of 
distance over trial completion time (F7,42 = 9.64, p < 0.01). Tamhane post-hoc pair-
wise comparison revealed the following pairs of distances were significant (-4, -3), (-
4, -2), (-4, -1), (-4, 1), (-3, -1), (-1, 2), (-1, 3), (-1, 4), (1, 4).  
Our results show that users are equally proficient in both directions (relaxing to 
excited or excited to relaxing state) as post-hoc comparisons did not reveal 
significant difference between pairs (-4,4), (-3,3), (-2,2) and (-1,1). 
Figure 27 shows the mean task completion time for each distance. The graph shows 
an almost linear correlation between the distance moved and the time taken—R2 
values fall between 0.93 and 0.96. There are two important observations from this 
plot. First, the similar trend slopes on the graph indicate that the effort required for 
movement is similar in both directions. Second, while this was not a reciprocal 
tapping task, there is evidence from the plot to support the idea that Fitts’ law may be 
a good predictor of time performance with brain-controlled movement. 
While we observed in Study 1 that participants found relaxing easier to achieve than 
becoming excited we could not find a similar affect in Study 2. In Experiments 1A, 1B 
and Experiment 2 the mean trial completion times at 5 states are similar for -0.6 and 
0.6. Note that Figure 24 (down) includes mean time for both 5 and 10 states so 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 42 
cannot be directly compared to Figure 27 but gives an indication that the data is 
similar. We thus believe that any difference in performance in either direction is small 
and less important at 5 states than higher states. 
 
Figure 27: Mean task completion time with a trend line showing linear correlation 
between time and distance. 
Finally, we found no significant effect of distance on number of false targets selected 
(F7,42 = 0.642, p > 0.1). Figure 28 shows the mean false targets selected for each 
distance.

Experiment 3: Distractions and Multi-tasking in a Game setting. 
With a better understanding of the low-level performance of BCI input from 
experiments 1 and 2, we were then interested in employing our guidelines to a 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 43 
gaming environment. The goal of this experiment was to examine users’ 
performance in their ability to control their emotions in a situation that required multi-
tasking. 
Design  
We designed a simple 2D game that required players to complete two tasks 
simultaneously—one required the use of a traditional input (wireless remote button), 
the other BCI-measured excitement. The user is required to move an on-screen 
avatar from the starting position on the left, to the end position on the right. During 
this task, a demon sends a fireball towards the avatar, which the player must destroy 
by modifying their excitement to the required level. If the player fails to destroy the 
fireball and/or fails to reach the end point within 30 seconds then the avatar is killed 
(Figure 29). 
Experimental Interface and Task 
The experimental game interface (Figure 1) was displayed on a 14 inch widescreen 
monitor (resolution 1400?900 pixels). Participants sat around 70 cm from the screen.  
Each trial begins when the user reaches a specified level of excitement, as visually 
indicated on the screen. This ensures all participants begin with the same excitement 
level. The participant presses a key on a wireless remote to move the character 
toward the finish line. A fireball appears as the user starts to move. A linear 
visualization with five states of excitement is attached to the character. Each state 
has a number inside and it is coloured in a different shade of red. The fireball has a 
shade of red and a number inside that matches one of the states on the 
visualization.   
 
Figure 29: the khaki circle is the avatar, red circle with a number inside is the fireball, 
and the grid is linear visualisation of player emotion. Player should destroy the 
fireball and reach to finish line before timeout. 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 44 
In order to destroy the fireball the user adjusts their level of excitement to match the 
number that is on the fireball. Once at that state, the user presses a second key to 
destroy the fireball. The matching of emotional state with the fireball’s ‘kill’ state is 
indicated visually by the avatar changing in appearance. 
Experimental Design and Procedure 
The experiment used a 2?8 between-participants design, with factors: 
• Expertise: Expert or novice user. Expert users had previous experience with 
the system through participation in either experiment 1 or 2. 
• Distance: +0.2, +0.4, +0.6, +0.8, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8 
The order of presentation of the distances was counterbalanced between 
participants. Each experiment consisted of three blocks of 16 trials. 
As with the previous experiments each participant was provided a full explanation of 
the study and given ample practice before the measured trials began. Users were 
encouraged to complete both tasks simultaneously—moving from one side of the 
screen to the other took 20 seconds (participants were informed of this), leaving only 
10 seconds which is less than the average time needed for completing the task, if 
they needed to pause to complete the excitement portion of the task (participants 
were informed of this). Between each block the participant had three minutes of rest. 
Participants 
Ten participants took part in this experiment. We used five participants who had 
previous BCI experience from one of our prior studies (4 male and 1 female) 
between the ages of 25 and 31. Another five participants (4 male and 1 female) 
between the ages of 22 and 27 who had heard of an EEG headset but none of them 
had used it before were recruited from a local university to participate in the 
experiment. 
Results & Discussion 
With 10 participants, the system recorded a total of 480 trials. Of the 240 trials that 
corresponded to experienced users, 202 resulted in successful completion of the 
task. In the remaining 38 trials the user either failed to reach the finish-line in time (in 
28 of the 38 trials) and/or failed to kill the demon before reaching the end (in 30 of 
the 38 trials).  
Novice users failed to complete the trial on 68 occasions; in 41 of the trials, the finish 
line was not reached and in 65 the daemon was not killed.  
Univariate ANOVA did not show any significant effect of experience (F1,63 = 0.786, p 
> 0.05) or distance on trial (F7,63 = 1.35, p > 0.05)  completion time. The average trial 
completion time was about 22.5sec across all users. This is expected as the task 
was time-bound and participants were encouraged to complete the task in the time 
allocated.  
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 45 
Univariate ANOVA on number of false targets selected showed a significant effect of 
experience (F1,63 = 4.67, p < 0.05), no effect of distance (F7,63 = 0.252, p > 0.05) and 
no interaction between the two. Experienced users selected significantly fewer false 
targets than novice users (experienced mean = 1.57, s.e. = 0.33; novice mean = 
2.62, s.e. = 0.34).  
We counted how frequently users stopped moving the avatar to kill the demon and 
measured stopping duration to see if there are any differences in how frequently and 
for how long experienced and novice users stopped to complete the excitement task. 
Univariate ANOVA did not show any significant effect of experience or distance on 
either of these measures. Figure 30 shows the mean frequency and number of false 
targets selected for experienced and novice users.  
 
 Figure 30: Mean frequency and number of false targets for Experienced (E) and 
Novice (N) users.  
Overall Experiment 3 indicates that novice users are able to control excitement in a 
game like setting with similar finesse than experienced users. The biggest 
disadvantage is that novice users tend to select far more false targets than 
experienced users.  
Discussion, implications, and Applications in Game Design 
BCI-based input has the potential to revolutionize the game-playing experience. The 
results from the studies in this research can provide guidance on how best to begin 
designing such experiences. 
Continuous vs. Discrete Input Control  
The studies in this research have shown that users can comfortably select from a list 
of five items (with a proportional increase in time as the selection distance 
increases). By modifying the discretization of the excitement range, game 
developers can modify the difficulty of parameter manipulation—increasing the 
number of levels requires more accuracy and a greater practice and skill level. The 
studies also showed that one direction of selection is not favoured over the other and 
that a linear mapping of excitement to cursor is appropriate for this type of task. 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 46 
The assignment of the emotional channel to a control should also characterize the 
selection of continuous or discrete input. For example, the selection of a weapon in a 
game would normally require discrete input control, but games with BCI could use 
continuous input to provide weapons that, in between discrete states, act as a 
morphed augmentation of two weapons. Where BCI is used as a passive parameter 
manipulator, the relaxed or excited brain states could adjust the balance between 
armour or weapon strength; this way, users who struggle with exact parameter 
selection do not ‘lose out’ in a BCI augmented game.  
It is also possible to design a game with different characters which work better in a 
specific level of emotion. For example, in a game like Warcraft Dota Allstars 
(www.playdota.com/) where characters have intelligence, strength and agility 
characteristics, low excitement could increase intelligence; medium excitement could 
increase strength and high excitement could increase the agility of the character. 
Error Resilience in BCI Game Design 
The swiftly changing nature of brain signals and the flickering inherent in BCI input 
due to this constant change makes very precise selections difficult. Unlike the 
common controller (keyboard, mouse) where a ‘slip’ error is a cause for incorrect 
input, BCI input is more erratic and influenced by environmental conditions. A 
player’s emotional involvement can easily spike when triggered by an external 
source (for example, a friend walking into the room). 
Experiment two showed that longer distance selections are more difficult (take more 
time) than smaller, closer selections. In these situations, developers can implement 
cumulative functions to let users achieve goals in small steps, rather than giant 
leaps. For example, a user might be able to pick up a distant sword by achieving a 
very high level of excitement. If they cannot reach this high level, then the sword may 
edge closer and closer to the user as they sustain a lower level of excitement. 
Game input needs to provide error tolerance to cope with this additional and possibly 
erratic input stream. Triggering actions such as firing a gun or casting a spell should 
not be purely based on the user’s excitement level, as this could likely lead to 
unintentional actions. In this work, small scale fluctuations were smoothened by the 
cursor becoming thicker combined with users indicating via a button when their 
excitement level was appropriate to make a selection. This latter type of mode-
switching may not be appropriate for all types of gaming. 
Serial vs. Parallel Interaction 
There are no technical restrictions on continuously monitoring and interpreting EEG 
signals. However, it is not like a mouse or a keyboard where it is clear when an input 
starts and ends. EEG input is ‘always on’, so designers must consider when a game 
is to utilize this input stream. For BCI-assisted games, there are two options: serial or 
parallel interaction. 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 47 
Serial interaction allows gamers time to concentrate on producing the excitement 
level required to complete the task—they do not need to perform mouse or keyboard 
input at the same time. Once their excitement level is measured they will continue 
playing the game using more traditional input methods. Serial interaction may allow 
users to complete their tasks faster (as it has their full attention), but breaks the flow 
of a game. For example, in a game like Delta Force a sniper’s target aim can be 
proportional to their level of excitement. If a player needs to aim at a small or far 
target he would need to bring down his level of excitement to the lowest level before 
firing the gun. 
Conversely, parallel interaction requires the user to continue input using traditional 
controllers, while appropriately adjusting their excitement level to match that required 
by the game. Parallel input increases the number of simultaneous inputs and allows 
a smoother flow of game-play. However, performing other tasks using traditional 
inputs may distract gamers who are concentrating on controlling their level of 
emotion. Consequently, users may take longer or struggle to complete BCI-
controlled tasks. For example, in a game like Diablo the player can move on a map 
and cast a spell simultaneously. The strength of the spell can be controlled by 
excitement level and if the character is too close to the monster then a strong spell 
can also kill the player. This would encourage players to be careful in selecting the 
spell level (encouraging greater control of excitement) but would also support error 
resilience by allowing players to kill a monster through multiple lower-level spells.  
Generalizability of Results 
Our experiments looked at users’ ability to control excitement. We used the Affectiv 
suite of Emotiv to carry out our experimental study. It is possible that if users perform 
the experiment with different hardware the results of the study may be different. We 
believe this will not be the case as arousal is a well understood concept within the 
computational neuroscience community with several pattern recognition approaches 
to compute it. Recent research has also have validated it against other physiological 
measure [45].  
Arousal can be viewed as a call to action while affect provides the direction of 
experience. It is therefore possible that users might have different levels of control 
for excitement depending on their affective state. This can be viewed as a limitation 
of our study but we believe that it is important to see in the first instance if arousal 
can be controlled and what design guidelines can be generated for it. Future 
research can look at carefully managing users’ affective state while examining their 
ability to control excitement.  
Lessons for Designers 
We provide the following guidelines to designers: 
• To the greatest extent possible, discretize the raw BCI signal into five discrete 
states; 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 48 
• Visual feedback showing the cursor, current state, and goal states should be 
abundantly clear to the user; 
• Novice users require training, thus short games suited as ‘training wheels’ 
could prove beneficial to transfer learners into expert mode; 
• Combined input with a typical controller is possible for both walk-up and 
expert users.  
Future works 
During the experiments some situation happened that did not have any known 
scientific reason. Basically they happened because complex structure of brain and 
complex relation of various emotions human have. 
Effect of Operant conditioning 
One observation which is quite interesting was effect of operant conditioning on 
participants. During design and development phases the experiment was ran several 
times on different people to find that the program is completely ready for the real 
experiment situation. 
In one session participant A took part in a pilot experiment. A was completely able to 
control his emotions to control the cursor on the screen (Figure 31 & 33). From the 
results we got from this experiment, it was decided to change flow of trials to quantify 
some more data about users’ control. However this change made trials a bit harder 
than before. 
 
Figure 31: Example of situation when user has control on her/his emotion to be 
relaxed. 
In order to compare the new experiment with previous one, A was asked to take part 
in the new version of experiment. However before the experiment session, the 
examiner told him that this experiment is harder to complete than before. Strangely, 
A was not able to control cursor at all (Figure 32). The first idea was that maybe 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 49 
there is a failure in development of new experiment. Hence, we tried to run previous 
experiment to make sure that there is a bug inside the new program. Oddly A was 
not able to control previous program as well. 
 
Figure 32: Example of situation when user is not able to control her/his emotions 
We ran the new experiment without any change on other participants without any 
precaution about hardness of the experiment. All of the participants were able to 
control the cursor successfully in new experiment. We asked A to participate in new 
experiment again, but this time we told him that the problems we had in previous 
session are solved and other people are able to control it. Amazingly, he controlled 
cursor successfully in that experiment session. 
Also, this condition happened in 3 other cases during pilot studies that a participant 
who was aware from some of the problems or did not believe on her/his ability to 
control emotions was failed to control cursor. 
These observations suggest studying effect of operant conditioning on ability of 
emotion control on users. 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 50 
 
Figure 33: Example of situation when user has control on her/his emotion to be 
excited. 
Measuring users’ awareness about their emotion control ability  
In order to understand requirements of users and designing next experiment, 
advantages and disadvantages of this kind of input control were discussed with 
participants. Most of the participants believed that the cursor is truly moving 
according to their excitement level. However, there were few participants who 
doubted that the cursor is moving according to their emotions. These statements 
suggest testing awareness of users about their control ability. 
In order to measure user’s awareness, one way is to design a random emotion 
generator engine. This engine should be able to produce same output as real engine 
in a way that users can finish trials with same statistical results.  
In the experiment user should be asked to complete a task using one of the engines 
without knowing which one is used. Then user should identify which engine was 
used in the trial. Using this experiment, it is possible to understand that how much 
perception of users about their awareness is close to reality. 
Effect of discouragement on user performance 
Another interesting observation we had was about effect of discouragement on 
users. In experiment 2 which was ran by  5 states, for the most of participants 
reaching to state 5 was very difficult, and in case it was the end state the probability 
of failure in completion of the trial was higher (Figure 34). In comparison reaching to 
state 4 was not that difficult for users (Figure 34). However most of the time that user 
was asked to go to state 5; they were usually even failed to reach state 4 (Figure 
35).  
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 51 
 
Figure 34: Number of times users failed to reach different states as end state. (Taken 
from experiment 2) 
This strange response of participants could be caused by discouragement of them in 
reaching to number 5. In fact, observations suggest that when user is not confident 
that it is possible to finish a task, her/his performance decreases radically.  
 
Figure 35: States that user ended up when they asked to go to state 5 and they failed. 
One way to examine effect of discouragement is to design another experiment which 
uses a new kind of trial along normal trials secretly. These new trials show the same 
interface to users (5 states); however they map excitement level of users into four 
first states. By comparing results of situations that users are asked to reach to state 
4 in new trials and when they are asked to reach to fifth state in normal trials (the 
level of excitement needed to reach both of them is the same), it is possible to 
identify effect of discouragement on users.  
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 52 
Moreover it is mentionable that this situation may be caused by effect of other 
emotion than discouragement. For example, frustration of user on doing a task may 
decrease the excitement level. 
Conclusion 
The experiments described in this research offer valuable guidelines for designers. 
We show that when discretizing raw excitement values five levels provide a good 
balance of speed and accuracy, users have good bi-directional control of excitement 
and are able to effectively control excitement in game-like multi-tasking scenarios. 
Our results also show that novice users are able to control excitement in a game like 
task and with a short training session they can noticeably improve their accuracy. 
Through detailed discussions and examples we show how our results could be used 
in game settings. 
The main contributions of this research are a systematic exploration of various 
parameters that influence mappings of excitement to virtual cursor control; a series 
of guidelines for designers and a demonstration of the practical value of our 
mappings in a gaming application.

Appendix A: Game scenario ideas 
Game development could be considered as a potential field for usage of BCI 
technology. By a quick look at the evolution of computer games, one can find that 
making players more involved in the game has been one of the key factors that 
game developer focused on.  
In the beginning, games consisted of simple graphical interfaces .Usually players 
used their imagination to believe that they are actually controlling a real object like a 
spaceship, tank or a human.  
Trend to make people more involved in the games started from early stages. 
Primitive games let players to select the name or colour of the character that they 
are controlling. By the advent of technology, game players had the chance to select 
the character they want to control among a set of characters with different abilities 
and styles. By improvement of graphical devices and engines, games let players to 
feel themselves in the shoes of character they are controlling. 
New competition between game consoles today is also could be considered as an 
improvement in players’ involvement. Nintendo Wii, Microsoft Xbox 360 Kinect and 
Sony PS3 Move are all example of game consoles that want to make players 
physically involved in the games. 
Emotional involvement could be considered as a new way to make players more 
involved in the games. The results of this research could be used in various ways. In 
this section, some game scenarios respect to result of this research discussed. 
Boxing 
Boxing is a game that has been available on most of the gaming consoles, even on 
primitive gaming consoles like Atari (Figure 36). However new consoles such as 
Nintendo Wii transformed the way players playing this kind of games. In fact, instead 
of using a joystick, players can cause aggressive and defensive actions of boxer by 
their body movements (Figure 37). 
 
Figure 36: Boxing game on Atari14.

Page 57 
In such situation player has to simulate real movements of a boxer in order to control 
the game. However player is able to move her/his arms aimlessly and the boxer will 
punch or defend. In fact player does not need to feel that s/he is on the ring. Using 
BCI systems it is possible to drive user in a way that s/he put her/himself in the game 
situation. Results of this research are useful in designing such a game.  
 
Figure 37: Player controlling a boxer in Nintendo Wii15. 
Designers should always remember that design of such games should be error 
resilience. In another word, player should be able to play the game even s/he is not 
able or want to be emotionally involved.  
For example if user is very excited he can deliver a bit more damage than the 
situation that user is not excited. In this situation user is still able to play the game 
without excitement, however design of the game encourage player to be excited to 
be more powerful. 
Another possible design is to consider various advantages on different part of the 
emotion range. For example user could increase defensive skills by being not 
excited and increase aggressive skills by being excited. With this strategy player has 
some benefits in all situations, however s/he is driven to control her/his emotions to 
have better performance in the game. 
Also, the research suggests that reaching to higher level of excitement is a bit harder 
for players. According to this fact, the bonuses that player gets in higher states could 
be slightly better than lower states. 
Sniper games 
Sniper games are another category of games that could utilise results of this 
research. In these category player should destroy a subject from far distances using 
a sniper rifle (Figure 38). In order to making the game more realistic, usually aim is 
constantly moving. Using EEG based BCI it is possible to relate range of instability of

Page 58 
aim to excitement of player. In fact, player can reduce fluctuation of aim by being 
less excited and focused. 
 
Figure 38: Screen shot of a sniper game (Sniper Art of Victory). 
Like previous example, design of the game should be error resilience. However 
because being not excited is a state which is a bit easier to reach for players, it is 
sensible to increase fluctuations of the aim more rapidly in case of excitement.   
Next thing that should be considered is number of states. Designers should consider 
that 5 states are more suitable for user to control. Hence using more than 5 states or 
using a continuous control could make it difficult to control for user. 
Defence of the Ancient (DotA) – Warcraft 
DotA is a costume map for the real-time strategy game Warcraft from Blizzard 
(Figure 39). The goal of this game is to fight with enemies and destroy their forth 
using the agents that are controlled either by players or artificial intelligence. 
 
Figure 39: Screen shot of DotA – Warcraft Frozen Throne (From Blizzard). 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 59 
Each player should select a hero in the beginning of the game from a set of available 
heroes. Each hero has 3 basic characteristics; agility (speed and pace of hero), 
intelligence (power of spells) and strength (hit point). These characteristics improve 
when player raise their levels by fighting with enemies. Also it is possible to improve 
them by buying some items. For each hero one characteristic is more important, 
improving that characteristic will cause better overall improvement of the hero’s 
ability. Hence, heroes can be categorized by their main characteristic. 
Players usually prefer to play with heroes inside one group, because playing with 
heroes from different groups needs different game strategies. Usually heroes who 
are very weak in the beginning, by selecting a good strategy can be very strong, 
while heroes who are strong in the beginning cannot be very strong near the end of 
the game.  
According to this fact, intelligent heroes usually better for novice players, strong 
heroes are usually selected by average players, and experts usually prefer to select 
agile heroes.  
The point which makes this game different from the previous ones is that players 
usually select the heroes according to their skills. It suggests that it is possible to add 
EEG based BCI to this game in a way that people who are able to control their brain 
better have the chance to select weaker heroes who can be stronger user brain 
waves, while novice user can select stronger heroes who do not need users brain 
control constantly but they cannot get more strong.

ABSTRACT 
The Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a non-traditional 
method of machine control that has the potential to 
revolutionise the gaming industry. However, we have 
little fundamental understanding of the speed and 
accuracy with which users can control virtual objects 
using only the excitement levels of their brain. This paper 
conducts a series of studies to investigate the use of BCI 
techniques in the context of gaming. We first investigated 
the accuracy with which users could select multiple visual 
states. Five states were found to be the most comfortable 
and users were able to move quickly in both directions 
(relaxation/excitement). In a second study, we found that 
users take a linearly increasing amount of time to increase 
and decrease their level of excitement. Finally, we 
investigated the practicalities of simultaneously 
controlling an avatar with traditional input and fighting a 
daemon with a BCI. Experienced users were more 
accurate in this parallel input task than novices. Based on 
these experimental results we discuss several game 
design principles.

INTRODUCTION 
The availability of off-the-shelf Electroencephalography 
(EEG) kits (such as the Emotive Epoc Neuroheadset and 
OCZ Neural Impulse Actuator - NIA) has made it 
possible to explore novel Brain-Computer Interfaces 
(BCI) for applications ranging from gaming [1] to cursor 
control [2]. EEG senses the underlying states of brain 
activity by interpreting the cortical potentials [3]. 
Researchers have demonstrated the capability of EEG 
based computer controllers through different point-
designs and in a number of applications [3-4]. Examples 
range from using an EEG signal for classifying user tasks 
[5] to controlling a wheelchair [6]. 
A common feature with most of these applications is their 
use of a sensed brain signal to manipulate a spatial 
parameter, such as moving a virtual cursor [2] or even a 
physical ball in different directions [1]. However, there 
exist only limited generic design principles to guide 
application developers in mapping a sensed parameter, 
such as the amount of excitement, to virtual control. For 
example, we do not know how many discrete levels of 
emotional arousal/excitement can be comfortably 
controlled.   
 
Figure 4: A user wearing the Emotive EEG headset in the 
study setup  
Different sensed parameters have been explored in the 
literature ranging from  engagement [7] to relaxation [1]. 
In this paper we focus primarily on deriving design 
principles based on emotional excitement as captured by 
the EEG signals. We conducted a systematic investigation 
into the parameters that can affect user control of an on-
screen object. We implemented three experiments—two 
exploring the parameters related to one dimensional 
selection and one gaming scenario that requires both 
traditional input and the use of a BCI. 
From these experiments we observed that (a) users can 
comfortably control five discrete levels of cursor 
movement with brain excitement; (b) the time taken to 
move to a particular level of excitement is proportional to 
the distance of the target; and (c) that the direction of 
control is uniform (it is as easy for users to relax than to 
get excited). In a final experiment we immersed the users 
in a multi-tasking scenario, analogous to one found in 
video games. In this environment, users were asked to use

a wireless remote and BCI input to move an avatar and 
destroy a demon. Most users were capable of 
multitasking but experienced users were more accurate at 
completing this task, confirming further the guidelines we 
derived from our results. 
The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a systematic 
exploration of various parameters that influence 
mappings of EEG signals to virtual cursor control; 2) 
quantifying the number of discrete levels that can be 
controlled via excitement states from EEG input; 4) a 
series of guidelines for designers; 5) a demonstration of 
the practical value of our mappings in a gaming 
application. 
RELATED WORK 
Electroencephalography (EEG)—the recording of 
electrical activity along the scalp caused by the firing of 
neurons—was invented a century ago [5]. Neuroscientists 
have shown that it is possible to understand the 
underlying states of the brain by sensing the vital 
activities of the brain through electrical signals that were 
caused by firing neurons in the cortex layer.  
A logical progression of this understanding has been to 
use this output to control computing machinery leading to 
the creation of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) 
research field which has a number of interesting 
applications. These include, new input methods for 
people with severe motor disabilities [8], extracting 
emotional and cognitive user states from users whilst 
interacting with computing machinery [9], facilitating 
real-time interface adaptation based on the user’s 
cognitive states [10], and augmenting traditional input 
controls with an additional emotional state, such as for 
computer games16. 
The remainder of this section examines methods of brain-
sensing technology other than EEG, techniques for 
measuring and processing EEG signals, use of EEG in 
games, and emotions and decision making.  
Alternative Brain Sensing Technology 
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and 
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are two 
additional methods of sensing the vital activities of the 
brain. fMRI senses the magnetic field around the scalp, 
while fNIRS measures the concentration of blood oxygen 
using infrared light [11]. 
fMRI is an effective technique for brain function imaging 
in medical science. However, it is vulnerable to the 
existence of metal objects and head movements [11], both 
of which are common when using a computer. For this 
reason, it is not favored by BCI researchers. fNIRS has 
lower temporal resolution compared to EEG making it 
challenging to detect fast responses after an event 
happened [12]. This precludes real-time interaction for 
controlling GUI-based systems. Despite the strength of 
this technique, EEG remains the choice sensing method 
for BCI research.

Measuring and Processing EEG Signals 
There are two approaches to measuring EEG signals: 
invasive (implanting an array of electrodes in the cortex 
layer of brain) and non-invasive (attaching a number of 
electrodes to the scalp). Non-invasive approaches can 
now reach the same level of accuracy and performance as 
invasive approaches [13]. Recent research has enabled a 
reduction in the number of required electrodes to collect 
EEG signals from outside of the scalp (e.g. 3, 9, and 16 
electrodes [5, 14]). 
Raw EEG signals can be mapped to application control 
using Operant Conditioning and Pattern Recognition [5]. 
Operant Conditioning requires that the user first train the 
system and then operates the application by repeating the 
same thoughts whereas Pattern Recognition uses signal 
processing and machine learning techniques to reveal the 
mental states or activities of untrained users. 
P300 response is one neurological phenomena that can be 
measured using EEG signals and pattern recognition. 
P300 can be considered as a composite index of both 
attention and memory [5]. It is based on detecting a 
specific type of EEG signal which peaks at around 300ms 
(but could be up to 900ms) after presenting a stimulus. 
The amplitude of a P300 signal is changed with the 
target's higher probability and lower discriminability and 
P300 latency decreases when targets are easier to 
distinguish [15].  
P300 has been widely used in various areas such as to 
improve the life of patients who cannot move or 
communicate but are still aware and awake [16].  Further 
examples include playing a virtual piano [17] or selecting 
different objects on a multi-touch screen [8]. However, 
due to its low performance and accuracy, P300 control 
remains an inconvenient input choice for the normal user 
[18].  
Use of EEG in Games 
Computer games have progressed from keyboard and 
joystick input to rich physical movements (such as the 
Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect). The expectation is 
that future games would take advantage of BCI input to 
increase the user’s involvement. One discovery that has 
made BCI more interesting for gaming has been to use 
imaginary movements to produce the same brain signals 
as real movements [19]; it is then possible to create a BCI 
based agent which replicates the user’s imagination [6]. 
The incorporation of BCI input technology into games 
can be categorized into three different groups: traditional 
games with BCI input, non-traditional games with BCI 
input, and games with BCI assisted input. 
Traditional games with BCI input. These games were 
designed for more traditional forms of input (like 
keyboard or mouse) but have been adapted to utilize BCI 
as the only input control for the game. By controlling 
different cognitive states, gamers can walk through and 
play the game without the assistance of their hands. 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 63 
Examples of these games include the walking game [20], 
or playing Ping-Pong using a BCI controller17. 
Non-traditional games with BCI input. The BCI input for 
‘non-traditional’ games affords the design of conceptually 
different games to those possible with traditional input 
mechanisms. For example, these games may utilize BCI 
capabilities to help players improve their mental 
awareness. As an example, in Brainball, gamers must 
relax in order to win the game [21]. 
BCI-input assisted games. The third group augments BCI 
input with traditional input control to provide a richer 
experience. For example, if the user is frustrated when 
attempting to complete a task, the game could assist the 
player, or if their level of engagement is not adequate, the 
game difficulty could be elevated [22]. Another example 
is Mindflex (mindflexgames.com) a game that requires 
users to navigate a ball through an obstacle course. The 
height of the ball is controlled by excitement while the 
movement in other directions is controlled by a knob.  
Emotions and Decision Making 
Emotion is an individual's state of mind about a complex 
psychological experience based on sensory stimulation 
[23]. Emotion is externally expressed in terms of "affect", 
such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise and disgust. 
These were referred to as the Big Six emotions [24] and 
do not include affects such as elevation [25], pride [26] or 
confusion [27], which were recently reported in the 
literature. An important aspect of emotion is arousal (or 
sometimes referred to as excitement) which is the state of 
responsiveness to sensory stimulation18. Arousal can be 
viewed as a call to action while affect provides the 
direction of experience [28]. As emotions can affect our 
actions in the physical world, there is a rich set of 
possibilities in harnessing these emotions in the virtual 
realm. However, from the review of the literature we 
cannot find generic design principles to guide application 
developers in mapping a sensed parameter.  
To gain this understanding we focus primarily on 
deriving design principles based on emotional excitement 
as captured by the EEG signals; we focus on excitement 
as this refers to the state of responsiveness to sensory 
stimulation.  
FACTORS INFLUENCING DESIGNS OF BCI SYSTEMS  
There are several factors that need to be considered when 
designing an EEG based system. Here we identify four 
factors that can guide the design of BCI-based systems: 
EEG emotion, mapping method, selection technique, and 
visual feedback.  
EEG Emotion  
There are a number of parameters of emotion that can be 
identified by measuring the EEG signals. Typical 
emotions include Joy, Sadness, Anger, Surprise, Fear, and 
Disgust [27] which can be mapped using machine 
learning techniques.

(visited 14/09/2010)  
18Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health 
Consumers 
Typically, the center of a brain's emotions is activated 
when people make a decision [28]. As a result, emotions 
can affect our decisions in ways unaware to us: thinking 
about the future can raise feelings that consequently 
affect our actions [29]; we make quick choices based on 
emotional instincts (such as in flight-or-fight situations) 
[30]; decisions based on our emotional states are 
influenced by gender [31]; and realistic decisions are 
made under the influence of emotions of sadness or 
desperation [32]. 
Designers must choose an appropriate emotion to map 
onto their required task. Some emotions, such as surprise, 
may be harder for users to replicate than others or be 
inappropriate for the task at hand (e.g. asking a user to be 
sad when they are winning the game).  
Discretization of Movement Space 
BCI input devices provide a continuous stream of 
constantly changing brain activity along a scale. In the 
case of the Emotiv Epoc Neuroheadset this scale ranges 
from zero to one. Continuous input control makes 
immediate use of this input value of parameter control. 
For example it is possible to use continuous input control 
to enhance-first person shooter games in this way such 
that if a player is excited, small movements which make 
targeting harder are executed more often. 
However, brain signals often spike and change quickly, 
making on-screen parameter control difficult. To provide 
more smooth and accurate control, the input range can be 
discretized into a smaller number of values or levels. This 
has the effect of reducing the accuracy required of users 
to select a specific value along a parameter range. Game 
designers need to balance the number of discrete states 
with the error tolerance desired – large number of states 
can lead to a finer the level of user control but with lower 
tolerance to fluctuations. To the best of our knowledge 
there is no reported results our how to suitably discretize 
this space, we investigate this issue in our later studies. 
Mapping Method 
The aim of a discrete mapping is to translate a level of 
human emotion into one discrete command. There are at 
least two types of common mappings that a designer 
could choose: absolute or relative mapping.  
Absolute mapping 
Absolute mapping updates the position of the cursor 
regardless of the user’s previous emotion state. This can 
be done either linearly or non-linearly. In the former, all 
of the emotion states are given the same weight whereas 
in the later different states afford different weights. In a 
linear mapping the position of the cursor is a direct one-
to-one function of the current value of an emotion. 
Commercial games like MindBall (www.mindball.se) and 
Mindflex (mindflexgames.com) use absolute mapping to 
map the excitement level to the distance of a physical ball 
which the user needs to control as part of a game.  
Relative Mapping 
In this mapping method, the position of the cursor is 
based on the difference between the current and the 
previous emotional states of the user. This can be 
performed in different ways. One approach is to calculate 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 64 
the distance of two consequent emotional states and with 
a function (linear or non-linear) calculate the 
displacement that should be applied to cursor (e.g. this is 
based on the operation of the computer mouse). 
Alternatively, the cursor displacement can be calculated 
relative to a neutral state, instead of a previous emotional 
state. 
Selection Technique 
A selection technique allows users to pick a state after 
moving the BCI-based cursor into the required level. 
There are two possible ways for selection to occur on BCI 
systems: one is within band, i.e. using BCI capabilities 
and the other is out-of-band, i.e. using a traditional input 
controller. Examples of techniques that only use BCI 
capabilities include dwelling, hovering upon one state for 
a number of times, and using another emotion for 
triggering selection. Examples of the second approach 
include double-clicking on the mouse, a keyboard, or 
voice recognition.  
Visual Feedback  
Feedback is one of the main building blocks of control 
systems. It is possible to visualize the feedback of a 
system in different ways according to needs and 
specification of the system. Because feedback is a part of 
closed control loop, the effect of it on the performance of 
user could be significant. 
Visual feedback is a key component of P300 based 
systems. Buttons or objects flash over a period of time on 
screen and users are asked to count the number of times 
an object of interest flashes to help them focus on the 
object and improve the P300 signal [30]. Thus different 
visual representations could have different outcomes. For 
instance, Ramos et. al. [29] showed in their study that 
users performed better with full visual feedback 
compared with spatial feedback. Many BCI-based outputs 
have been used as control input. However, there is little 
research which investigates how well a user can control 
these input states in different conditions and different 
forms of representations. We conducted three 
experiments to study these questions. 
EXPERIMENT 1: IDENTIFYING LEVELS OF CONTROL 
The primary goal of this experiment is to establish the 
accuracy with which a user can manipulate their 
excitement levels to control an object. A secondary goal 
was to examine the suitability of different types of visual 
feedback.  
Participants wore the Emotiv Epoc Neuroheadset headset 
to measure their levels of excitement (hardware details of 
the headset are in the Appendix-1). They were then asked 
to move a cursor from a starting position to an end 
position by becoming more excited or more relaxed. 
Since excitement is a measure of brain activity, 
participants were informed that mentally solving complex 
problems or thinking of past memories would stimulate 
brain activity. 
We divided this study into two parts: 1A and 1B. The 
experimental setup remained identical between the two 
parts, the conditions and participants were modified, as 
reported at the beginning of experiment 1B.  
Experimental Interface and Task 
The experimental interface (Figure ) had a size of 
1280?800 pixels and was displayed on a 14 inch 
widescreen monitor (resolution 1400?900 px). 
Participants sat 70cm from the screen. At the beginning 
of a trial, the start position is shaded orange and end state 
is shaded green. To ready the participant, a three-second 
countdown begins. During this time, the end state fades 
from fully shaded to only an outline. Once the countdown 
completes, the user can move the cursor by changing their 
excitement. 
 
Figure 5: Linear and Bull’s eye visualizations. Yellow circle 
shows the state of the user, orange square shows the start 
state, green circle/square shows the end state, and red 
line/circle shows cursor. 
The participants’ initial excitement level must match the 
start state before a trial begins. To achieve this, the 
participant must modify their excitement level to move 
the cursor into the start state, and keep it at a constant 
excitement for at least 200ms, at which point the trial 
begins. The user then adjusts their excitement level to 
reach the target. Once over the target, the user presses a 
key on a wireless remote to indicate the end of the trial. 
Trials are terminated if the user requires more than one 
minute to move and select the target. In this study, we use 
a one-to-one mapping of excitement level cursor position. 
To reduce cursor jitter, we set a threshold for showing 
cursor movement. If the change of excitement was less 
than that threshold (set at 0.03 in our experiments), the 
cursor became thicker (and faded in colour). This 
indicated small scale ‘bouncing’ movement to the user. 
The cursor returned to its normal thin line visualization 
when the user’s excitement settled or if a large scale 
excitement was detected. 
Procedure 
After completing appropriate consent forms, the Emotive 
headset was placed on the user and their comfort 
confirmed. Each participant was provided with an 
explanation of the control mechanism—by relaxing they 
would move the cursor towards the left (or center, 
depending on the visualization, see below) and by 
becoming more excited they would move the cursor up or 
outwards. 
Participants were then given ample time to practice the 
control mechanism with both of the visualizations used. 
Each experiment consisted of 4 blocks of 16 trials. 
Between each block of trials the participant were given 
Thinking about Control| Quantifying Properties of BCI for Gaming Applications 
Page 65 
the opportunity to rest for three minutes. The study took 
on average 60 minutes per participant, including practice 
time. 
Study 1A  
The experiment used a 2?4?2 within-participants design, 
with factors: 
• Number of states: 5, 10. By increasing the number of 
states, users should be able to more accurately select 
items from those available.  
• Emotional Distance: +0.29, +0.59, -0.59. Excitement is 
measured on a linear scale from 0 to 1. Emotional 
distance is a measurement along this scale—positive 
distance indicates movement from relaxed to excited, 
negative movement from excited to relaxed.  
• Visualization: Linear, Bullseye. A one-dimensional 
matrix layout or a bullseye-like set of concentric circles 
(see Figure ). 
The factors visualization and number of states were 
counterbalanced between participants. The experiment 
consisted of four blocks of 16 trials with the presentation 
of distances modified between blocks. 
Participants 
Seven participants (6 male and 1 female) between the 
ages of 24 and 31 volunteered for the study. All were 
from a local university and they had all heard of an EEG 
headset but none of them had used one before. 
Results 
The total number of trials that were successfully 
completed was 424 out of 448. The average trial 
completion time for successful trials was 12.45 sec (s.e. = 
0.54 sec). We carried out statistical tests using a 
univariate ANOVA with Tamhane post-hoc pair-wise 
comparisons (not equal variance assumed) to compare the 
effect of number of states and visualization. 
There was a significant effect of number of states on trial 
completion time (F1,6 = 39.7, p < 0.01), with five states 
significantly faster (10.02 sec) than ten states (14.97 sec). 
We found no significant effect of number of states on 
false target selection (F1,6 = 3.76, p = 0.07)—five states 
had an average of 3.9 false selections, ten states 4.5. 
Figure  shows the mean task completion time per state for 
each visualization. 
We found no significant effect of visualization on trial 
completion time (F1,6 = 0.259, p > 0.1, linear = 7.75sec, 
bullseye = 7.64s) or number of false targets selected (F1,6 
= 0.013, p > 0.1, linear = 0.239, bullseye = 0.233). An 
exit survey showed no differences in user perception of 
frustration or effort between these two visualizations.  
There is a significant effect of distance on trial 
completion time (F2,18 = 3.66, p = 0.032) and number of 
false targets selected (F2,18 = 46.748, p = 0.001). As can 
be seen from Figure 4, post-hoc pair-wise comparisons 
showed users were significantly faster (p < 0.05) at 
relaxing (-0.59) than getting excited (0.59). They also had 
significantly fewer false targets selected when going to 
0.29 than 0.59. None of the other pairs showed 
significance.

Figure 4: Task completion time in sec (Left) and false 
targets selected (right) over distances for Study 1A (1 = -
0.59, 2 = 0.29, 3 = 0.59). 
Study 1B 
In Study 1A we saw that users were significantly faster 
when selecting from five states over ten and that there 
were less false selections using less states. Based on this 
result, we predicted that users should be even faster when 
selecting from three states over five. We ran Study 1B to 
test this hypothesis—it was run with an identical setup as 
study 1A, with the number of states and participants 
differing as documented below. 
Setup Differences 
To validate or refute our hypothesis, we modified the 
levels of the number of states factor to three and five. 
An additional seven participants (2 male and 5 female) 
between the ages of 25 and 30 were recruited for study 
1B. As per experiment 1A, all had heard of an EEG 
headset but none of them had used one before. 
Results 
The total number of trials that were successfully 
completed was 420 out of 448. The average trial 
completion time for successful trials was 12.6 sec (s.e. = 
0.56 sec). We carried out similar statistical tests to study 
1A.  
We found no significant effect of number of states on trial 
completion time (F1,83 = 0.152, p > 0.05) or number of 
false targets selected (F1,83 = 2.86, p > 0.05). Interestingly, 
users were marginally faster and selected fewer false 
targets when performing with five states (mean 12.5 sec, 
1.84 errors) than with three (mean 12.7 sec, 2.12 errors) 
as can be seen from Figure 5. 
As with Study 1A, we found no significant effect of 
visualization on trial completion time (F1,83 = 2.205, p > 
0.05). However, we did find a significant effect of 
visualization on number of false targets selected (F1,83 = 
5.64, p = 0.02). Users were more accurate with the linear 
visualization (mean 1.85 false selections) than with the 
bulls-eye visualization (2.12).

Discussion: Study 1A and 1B 
From studies 1A and 1B we learned that the number of 
states is an important factor in the control of an on-screen 
cursor using BCI input. Our studies showed that five 
states is preferable over ten states, however, we did not 
show that three states were significantly faster than five. 
We therefore choose five states as a comfortable range in 
which users can move a cursor. We use this value for our 
remaining studies.  
EXPERIMENT 2: EXCITEMENT-BASED DISTANCE 
CONTROL 
Experiment one showed that users were successfully able 
to move the cursor in order to select items on a one-
dimensional visualization. In this experiment, we sought 
to investigate the effect of excitement direction and 
distance in greater detail. 
Experimental Design and Procedure 
The interface, design, and procedure for experiment two 
are identical to experiment one, except as noted below. In 
this study we manipulated one factor, the selection 
distance. 
Number of states: From the previous two studies we saw 
that five states was optimal for this type of cursor 
movement and selection task. For this experiment, the 
number of states remained constant at five. 
Visualisation: The first experiment showed that there was 
no significant difference between the selection time for 
the two visualizations, with study 1B finding the linear 
visualization was more accurate for selection. For this 
reason, we choose to only use the linear visualization.  
Block design: We used four blocks with each block 
sampling each of the eight distances two times. 
Distances: We selected four forward (increasing 
excitement) and four backward (decreasing excitement) 
distances: +0.2, +0.4, +0.6 +0.8 and -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8. 
Recall that in a five state condition a movement of 0.2 
equates to shifting one state. Where possible, the start 
position of these distances was also varied. 
Participants 
Seven participants (5 male and 2 female) between the 
ages of 24 and 27 were recruited from a local university 
to participate in the experiment. All participants had 
heard of an EEG headset but none of them had used one 
before.  
Results and Discussion 
The total number of trials that were successfully 
completed was 414 out of 448. The average trial 
completion time for successful trials was 16.22 sec (s.e. = 
0.68 sec).  
As one would expect, an ANOVA showed that there was 
a significant effect of distance over trial completion time 
(F7,42 = 9.64, p < 0.01). Tamhane post-hoc pair-wise 
comparison revealed the following pairs of distances 
were significant (-4, -3), (-4, -2), (-4, -1), (-4, 1), (-3, -1), 
(-1, 2), (-1, 3), (-1, 4), (1, 4).  
Our results show that users are equally proficient in both 
directions (relaxing to excited or excited to relaxing state) 
as post-hoc comparisons did not reveal significant 
difference between pairs (-4,4), (-3,3), (-2,2) and (-1,1). 
Figure 6 shows the mean task completion time for each 
distance. The graph shows an almost linear correlation 
between the distance moved and the time taken—R2 
values fall between 0.93 and 0.96. There are two 
important observations from this plot. First, the similar 
trend slopes on the graph indicate that the effort required 
for movement is similar in both directions. Second, while 
this was not a reciprocal tapping task, there is evidence 
from the plot to support the idea that Fitts’ law may be a 
good predictor of time performance with brain-controlled 
movement. 
While we observed in Study 1 that participants found 
relaxing easier to achieve than becoming excited we 
could not find a similar affect in Study 2. In Experiments 
1A, 1B and Experiment 2 the mean trial completion times 
at 5 states are similar for -0.6 and 0.6. Note that Figure 4 
(right) includes mean time for both 5 and 10 states so 
cannot be directly compared to Figure 6 but gives an 
indication that the data is similar. We thus believe that 
any difference in performance in either direction is small 
and less important at 5 states than higher states.

showing linear correlation between time and distance.  
Finally, we found no significant effect of distance on 
number of false targets selected (F7,42 = 0.642, p > 0.1). 
Figure 7 shows the mean false targets selected for each 
distance.

either of these measures. Figure 8 shows the mean 
frequency and number of false targets selected for 
experienced and novice users.  
  
Figure 8: Mean frequency and number of false targets for 
Experienced (E) and Novice (N) users.  
Overall Experiment 3 indicates that novice users are able 
to control excitement in a game like setting with similar 
finesse than experienced users. The biggest disadvantage 
is that novice users tend to select far more false targets 
than experienced users.  
DISCUSSION, IMPLICATIONS, AND APPLICATIONS IN 
GAME DESIGN 
BCI-based input has the potential to revolutionize the 
game-playing experience. The results from the studies in 
this paper can provide guidance on how best to begin 
designing such experiences. 
Continuous vs. Discrete Input Control  
The studies in this paper have shown that users can 
comfortably select from a list of five items (with a 
proportional increase in time as the selection distance 
increases). By modifying the discretization of the 
excitement range, game developers can modify the 
difficulty of parameter manipulation—increasing the 
number of levels requires more accuracy and a greater 
practice and skill level. The studies also showed that one 
direction of selection is not favoured over the other and 
that a linear mapping of excitement to cursor is 
appropriate for this type of task. 
The assignment of the emotional channel to a control 
should also characterize the selection of continuous or 
discrete input. For example, the selection of a weapon in 
a game would normally require discrete input control, but 
games with BCI could use continuous input to provide 
weapons that, in between discrete states, act as a morphed 
augmentation of two weapons. Where BCI is used as a 
passive parameter manipulator, the relaxed or excited 
brain states could adjust the balance between armor or 
weapon strength; this way, users who struggle with exact 
parameter selection do not ‘lose out’ in a BCI augmented 
game.  
It is also possible to design a game with different 
characters which work better in a specific level of 
emotion. For example, in a game like Warcraft Dota 
Allstars (www.playdota.com/) where characters have 
intelligence, strength and agility characteristics, low 
excitement could increase intelligence; medium 
excitement could increase strength and high excitement 
could increase the agility of the character. 
Error Resilience in BCI Game Design 
The swiftly changing nature of brain signals and the 
flickering inherent in BCI input due to this constant 
change makes very precise selections difficult. Unlike the 
common controller (keyboard, mouse) where a ‘slip’ 
error is a cause for incorrect input, BCI input is more 
erratic and influenced by environmental conditions. A 
player’s emotional involvement can easily spike when 
triggered by an external source (for example, a friend 
walking into the room). 
Experiment two showed that longer distance selections 
are more difficult (take more time) than smaller, closer 
selections. In these situations, developers can implement 
cumulative functions to let users achieve goals in small 
steps, rather than giant leaps. For example, a user might 
be able to pick up a distant sword by achieving a very 
high level of excitement. If they cannot reach this high 
level, then the sword may edge closer and closer to the 
user as they sustain a lower level of excitement. 
Game input needs to provide error tolerance to cope with 
this additional and possibly erratic input stream. 
Triggering actions such as firing a gun or casting a spell 
should not be purely based on the user’s excitement level, 
as this could likely lead to unintentional actions. In this 
work, small scale fluctuations were smoothened by the 
cursor becoming thicker, combined with users indicating 
via a button when their excitement level was appropriate 
to make a selection. This latter type of mode-switching 
may not be appropriate for all types of gaming. 
Serial vs. Parallel Interaction 
There are no technical restrictions on continuously 
monitoring and interpreting EEG signals. However, it is 
not like a mouse or a keyboard where it is clear when an 
input starts and ends. EEG input is ‘always on’, so 
designers must consider when a game is to utilize this 
input stream. For BCI-assisted games, there are two 
options: serial or parallel interaction. 
Serial interaction allows gamers time to concentrate on 
producing the excitement level required to complete the 
task—they do not need to perform mouse or keyboard 
input at the same time. Once their excitement level is 
measured they will continue playing the game using more 
traditional input methods. Serial interaction may allow 
users to complete their tasks faster (as it has their full 
attention), but breaks the flow of a game. For example, in 
a game like Delta Force a sniper’s target aim can be 
proportional to their level of excitement. If a player needs 
to aim at a small or far target he would need to bring 
down his level of excitement to the lowest level before 
firing the gun. 
Conversely, parallel interaction requires the user to 
continue input using traditional controllers, while 
appropriately adjusting their excitement level to match 
that required by the game. Parallel input increases the 
number of simultaneous inputs and allows a smoother 
flow of game-play. However, performing other tasks 
using traditional inputs may distract gamers who are 
concentrating on controlling their level of emotion. 
Consequently, users may take longer or struggle to

complete BCI-controlled tasks. For example, in a game 
like Diablo the player can move on a map and cast a spell 
simultaneously. The strength of the spell can be 
controlled by excitement level and if the character is too 
close to the monster then a strong spell can also kill the 
player. This would encourage players to be careful in 
selecting the spell level (encouraging greater control of 
excitement) but would also support error resilience by 
allowing players to kill a monster through multiple lower-
level spells.  
Generalisability of Results 
Our experiments looked at users’ ability to control 
excitement. We used the Affectiv suite of Emotiv to carry 
out our experimental study. It is possible that if users 
perform the experiment with different hardware the 
results of the study may be different. We believe this will 
not be the case as arousal is a well understood concept 
within the computational neuroscience community with 
several pattern recognition approaches to compute it. 
Recent research has also have validated it against other 
physiological measure [31].  
Arousal can be viewed as a call to action while affect 
provides the direction of experience. It is therefore 
possible that users might have different levels of control 
for excitement depending on their affective state. This 
can be viewed as a limitation of our study but we believe 
that it is important to see in the first instance if arousal 
can be controlled and what design guidelines can be 
generated for it. Future research can look at carefully 
managing users affective state while examining their 
ability to control excitement.  
Lessons for Designers 
We provide the following guidelines to designers: 
•  To the greatest extent possible, discretize the raw BCI 
signal into five discrete states; 
•  Visual feedback showing the cursor, current state, and 
goal states should be abundantly clear to the user; 
•  Novice users require training, thus short games suited 
as ‘training wheels’ could prove beneficial to transfer 
learners into expert mode; 
• Combined input with a typical controller is possible for 
both walk-up and expert users.  
CONCLUSION 
The experiments described in this paper offer valuable 
guidelines for designers. We show that when discretizing 
raw excitement values five levels provide a good balance 
of speed and accuracy, users have good bi-directional 
control of excitement and are able to effectively control 
excitement in game-like multi-tasking scenarios. Our 
results also show that novice users are able to control 
excitement in a game like task and with a short training 
session they can noticeably improve their accuracy. 
Through detailed discussions and examples we show how 
our results could be used in game settings. 
The main contributions of this paper are a systematic 
exploration of various parameters that influence 
mappings of excitement to virtual cursor control; a series 
of guidelines for designers and a demonstration of the 
practical value of our mappings in a gaming application.

APPENDIX 1 - BCI HARDWARE 
There are several commercial EEG based BCI devices 
available such as the Emotiv Epoc Neuroheadset, OCZ 
Neural Impulse Actuator (NIA) and PLC devices XWave. 
In this work we use the Epoc Neuroheadset.  
The Emotiv Epoc Neuroheadset is a readily available and 
relatively cheap EEG based controller ($750 for a 
research kit). It is currently being used by many game 
developers (both board games and digital games) to 
augment the users’ gaming experience. The Emotiv 
headset is a dry cap set which does not require wet gel 
and instead uses 16 saline sensors. A gyroscope is 
embedded in the device for detecting the head’s 
orientation and wireless communication allows free head 
movement. The set has an internal sampling rate of 
1280Hz which is used to produce an output rate of 
128Hz. It can detect and respond to three kinds (or 
Suites) of EEG signals: 
• Expressiv Suite: Facial expression detection, for 
example winks, laughing, blinking, raising brows and 
smiling.  
• Affectiv Suite: This suite can detect the emotions of 
users, for example excitement, engagement/boredom, 
meditation and frustration. 
• Cognitiv Suite: This suite is able to recognize mental 
states of user.  It can recognize 13 distinct actions: six 
directional movements (push, pull, left, right, up, 
down), six rotational movements (clockwise, counter-
clockwise, left, right, forward, backward) and one 
imaginary movement (disappear).  
Values corresponding to each Suite are floating-point 
numbers between 0 and 1 that shows the percentage of 
similarity of one’s state to a specific emotion or action.
