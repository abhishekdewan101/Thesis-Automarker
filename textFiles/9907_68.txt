Abstract 
 
Power management is mandatory in SoC design. It is a well known fact that any 
consumer product quality cannot be compromised despite the massive additional 
complexity that power efficient design imposes on them. Consumer products must only 
use the minimum power based on what they are connected to. This need, to reduce the 
power consumption has been recognized as a design issue and it is critical when ICs 
become more complex and faster and time to the market is shrinking.  
 
Power management is currently performed bottom-up. This is achieved by adding low-
level design features in the hardware and the control mechanism that can be used by the 
software applications. While tools exist to help the hardware engineers analyze the 
effects of design decisions on power consumption, the software developers has no way 
to view the effect on power, of their decisions taken on architecture, design or code. In 
addition, it is hard to understand the impact of their low power features for hardware 
engineers. Thus, given that most of the dynamic power choices are made in software, the 
biggest power gains are made when the application software layers are power-aware. 
Considering this, there is a strong need for a research to correlate power consumption 
data from the hardware domain in such a way that a software engineer can make 
informed choices about power management algorithms [1]. 
 
Considering an Ethernet System, we explore its power efficiency when used with its 
hardware and software address look-up table versions. This will let know the software 
engineer what to use, either the hardware or the software address look-up table 
according to his requirement. This has been achieved in the following major steps. 
 
• Studied in detail the Cadence SoC Verification Kit which includes the necessary 
design IP to construct a realistic Ethernet Switch SoC. 
 
• Explored the construction of software and hardware address look-up table. 
 
• Created smart benchmark programs and integrated them with the Ethernet SoC 
using the hardware software co-verification methodology from Cadence. 
 
• Collected power data after running the benchmark programs with respect to 
hardware and software perspective. 
 
• Found the various modules consuming more power in each system and provided 
valuable suggestions on improving the performance of both hardware and 
software versions of the module.

Aims and Objectives 
 
The aim of this project is to undertake and investigate a system power analysis in order 
to attain maximum power efficiency and to let the software engineers know how the 
power management can be done efficiently ahead of completing the software 
development.  It is to show how a system level power analysis can be performed and 
how this analysis reflects back to the hardware view. This project will analyze and 
critique system power consumption data from a software engineer's perspective. 
 
We have taken a System-on-Chip (SoC) for this project which consists of four port 
Ethernet Media Access Controls (MACs) and one Address Look-up Table which is of key 
interest. The other modules in the SoC include a processor, memory and few assorted 
peripherals. This system has been given two options to choose from, an embedded 
software and a hardware IP, for performing the Address Look-up Table functionality. The 
power consumption of the overall system may differ while using the hardware and 
software look-up table blocks. The hardware look-up table block (written in Verilog) and 
the software look-up table block (written in C) also has their advantages and 
disadvantages in other perspectives. It is true that there is a trade-off between hardware 
and software versions when it comes to performance, maintenance and size.  
 
However, which version is better to use when it comes to saving power? Given both 
hardware and software versions of look-up table algorithms in a system, how will a 
software engineer know which one to choose depending on his/her requirements?  
 
This project analyses the power consumption of this Ethernet system in two main 
perspectives, the hardware Address Look-up Table perspective and the software Address 
Look-up Table perspective. This involves the understanding of the overall system, 
detailed study on the construction of the hardware and the software versions of the 
look-up table modules, the switching between hardware and software versions, study on 
the Cadence verification kit, and study on Universal Verification Components (UVCs) etc.  
 
The understanding of Cadence SoC Verification Kit includes the study of all the necessary 
design IP to construct a realistic Ethernet Switch SoC, and a complete related tool chain 
for power analysis. This verification kit gives us the ability to automate and reuse the 
advanced verification techniques. This includes the full range of EDA tools that we can 
use. This kit comes with various Cadence simulation engines which include Incisive 
Enterprise Simulator, Incisive Formal Verifier, Incisive Enterprise Verifier, Incisive 
Enterprise Manager, and Incisive Specman Elite. Most of these tools are used for this 
research.  
  
Benchmark programs are the key elements for this project. They represent the system 
scenario. Understanding, creating, executing and running the benchmark programs with 
the use of different seeds for this system gives us the power information. The output is

presented in a table format containing all the information required for understanding the 
power consumption. This is further analysed in way so as to find which version is the 
most power efficient. 
  
The important step of this project is to correlate the data obtained to the software level, 
to help the software developers understand the data and to know how power 
management can be done efficiently. This is achieved by analysing the results obtained 
after running the benchmark programs and by providing valuable suggestion on 
improving both the versions of the look-up table modules by performing critical analysis.

Background, Context and Previous Work 
 
2.1. Introduction: 
A vast number of low-level hardware techniques have been developed in order to assist 
the hardware designers these days. To name a few, clock-gating, power-shut off, and 
dynamic voltage/frequency scaling are the most widely used techniques. For example, 
the RAM which is partitioned into various segments can be individually put in shut-off or 
in stand-by condition which can be done in the hardware layer, use of multi-voltage 
islands, dynamic scaling of threshold voltage and clock frequency. These techniques will 
help conserve the battery power while delivering high performance [6].  
 
Other examples include the sleep mode in which the firmware requests the CPU to sleep 
after a particular timeout value, and hibernation mode in which the application layer 
requests for the hibernation, after the user presses the hibernate button.  Techniques for 
power management should also assure that every part of the product should receive 
power in a proper and efficient way.  When there is high power dissipation, it generally 
increases the junction temperature of the transistors and the resistances of 
interconnects. Thus there will be shortfall in the performance if the power dissipation is 
not considered.  
 
New strategies and design techniques are required to address the power management 
issues. These strategies need to address every level of abstraction within the design-
cycle. The gains, thus procured are of a much higher magnitude when considered in the 
earlier phases of the design, say from system design phase [5]. 
 
The software developers will not have any idea on how their software will have an 
impact on the hardware power dissipation. If they could know this information way 
before they start their phase in the project, there is a chance that the power saved will 
have a big number.  
 
This is the main intention of this project, a research through which the power 
consumption data from the hardware layer can be correlated to the software layer and 
software engineers can make decisions way ahead of the coding phase. The following 
section analysis the various steps that have been used already in order to achieve low 
power. We will go from the very basics of power dissipation concepts and then into a 
wider context. Further down, we will look into how low power intent is verified which 
forms the beginning step of this project and finally how the latest trend in using common 
power format can help in saving power.

2.2 Power Dissipation in CMOS: 
 
The total power dissipated in a CMOS is a function of its switching activity, voltage, 
capacitance and its transistor structure. Thus the total power is the sum of dynamic and 
the leakage power. The switching power and the short circuit power represent the 
dynamic power.  
 
2.2.1 Switching Power: 
 
Switching power is the power dissipated during charging and discharging of the 
capacitance. This is given by the following equation [1].  
 
Powerswitching   = f.?.C.Vdd
2 
Where, 
f = The switching frequency 
? = The switching activity 
C = The effective capacitance 
Vdd = The supply voltage 
 
Short-Circuit Power: 
 
During the time when the gate switches its state, there is a power dissipated by an 
instantaneous short circuit between the ground and the supply voltage. This power 
dissipation depends on the short circuit current during the switching, supply voltage and 
the switching frequency [1]. 
PowerShortcircuit = f.Vdd.I 
 
I = The short circuit current 
Vdd = The supply voltage 
f = The switching frequency 
 
From the above equations it is clear that the switching activity and the clock frequency 
reduction will reduce the dynamic power dissipation. The dynamic power will be 
dissipated only while switching. 
 
2.2.2 Leakage Power: 
 
The leakage power is continuous and it is dependent on the supply voltage, threshold 
voltage and the size of the transistor [1]. 
 
PLeak = f.(Vth.Vdd.W/L) 
Vth = The threshold voltage 
Vdd = The supply voltage 
W = The transistor width 
L = The length of transistor

2.3 Power Management in a wider Context: 
 
Power management for SOC’s is done by many ways with respect to, clock, memory 
considerations, voltage, and frequency. The following are the most widely employed 
power management techniques. Before we start with the correlation of the power 
consumption data, we will have to understand the basic ways in which the industry has 
been moving in order to save power. After this, we will look into the new concepts on the 
implementation [6]. 
 
2.3.1. Clock Gating: 
 
The specification of the system clock requirements, controlling clock frequency and 
gating are critical in reducing the predefined factors of power consumption. For saving 
power, the clock gating is supported by additional logics to the circuit. This disables 
certain portions of the circuit so that the values do not change during the normal 
operation. This in turn will make the switching power to nil and only the basic leakage 
power will be there. In simple words, turning the clocks off when they are not required is 
called clock gating. This is generally done by any of the two ways, soft control and 
dynamic control [6] [1] [14]. 
 
Soft Control: 
 
In soft control method, the software can be extended and it can be made to enable or 
disable the clock. It is also now possible to switch the clock frequency to various parts of 
the design. 
 
Dynamic Control: 
 
In dynamic control method, enabling and disabling of clock frequency is done by the 
hardware control. If the hardware detects request from functional units for any specific 
function it sets the clock frequency accordingly. In both the cases, the control is done 
through a central clock distribution circuit.  
 
2.3.2 Using multiple Vth: 
 
For power optimization, gates can have different threshold voltages. Most libraries these 
days come with different cell switching thresholds. They can be used in a circuit to meet 
the demands for speed, area and lower power dissipation [12] [14]. 
 
2.3.3 Operand Isolation: 
 
Certain parts of the circuit need not respond to their inputs all the time. During this time 
their data paths can be made inactive and it will have a constant value. This inactivation 
of the data path results in saving the dynamic power [13]. 
 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
6 | P a g e   
 
2.3.4. Memory Considerations: 
 
Power consumption also depends on the memory usage. A good memory configuration 
means a lot of power can be saved. There have always been trade-offs between the 
usage of RAM and ROM, hardware functionality and software functionality [2]. 
 
Trade-off between RAM and ROM: 
 
The code can either be placed in ROM or RAM and there have always been tradeoffs 
between them. Usage of RAM will provide a good performance however the power 
usage by RAM is high compared to the ROM. Most of the dynamic power requirements in 
RAM are in pre-charging and discharging the bit lines. The power consumption in RAM 
can be reduced to an extent by partitioning. For e.g. 1024X32 RAM can be partitioned 
into four 256X32 RAMs.  Sub-partitioning within a RAM is also possible. ROM on the 
other hand uses less power. However, there is a limit for its usage which depends on the 
application and the performance.  
 
2.3.5. Dynamic Voltage Scaling: 
 
It is possible to vary the voltage based on the demands of the upcoming task. This is 
generally done by using a Power Control Module (PCM). Voltage can either be increased 
or it can be decreased. Overvolting is a dynamic voltage scaling technique through which 
the voltage is increased which results in improved performance. Undervolting is a 
technique in which the voltage is decreased which results in power conservation. The 
MOSFET operates according to the input voltages which switch between high voltage and 
low voltage during the normal operation. The toggling of voltage depends on the 
charging and discharging of the capacitance. When we apply higher voltages, it results in 
faster charging and faster discharging which in turn results in a faster operation of the 
circuit. Because of this there is a trade off in choosing the voltages since the system will 
become slower for undervolting and consumes power for overvolting [14] [2]. 
 
2.3.6. Dynamic Frequency Scaling: 
 
When a section of the design has to wait for other tasks to get completed, the frequency 
can be lowered. This technique is generally done in conjunction with dynamic voltage 
scaling since the power is depended much on the voltage then the frequency. These day 
is has become common to operate a system briefly in its peak speed and then stay in a 
deep idle state than running it in a lower frequency [14] [2]. 
 
2.3.7. Power Islands: 
 
A system generally consists of different sections with different performance requirement. 
For e.g. an I/O controller can be made to turn-off its interfaces which are not needed 
when no devices are currently connected to them or a mouse movement for keyboard 
entry for a sleeping PC. In traditional systems, it is possible to have different power 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
7 | P a g e   
 
supply for different chips. However it does not allow us to control or give different 
voltage levels within a chip. Here, a new concept called power island or voltage island 
comes in picture where different areas of a single chip is made to operate at different 
voltage levels and different frequency levels independent of each other. High voltages 
will be used in the most performance critical areas and nominal voltages will be used in 
the performance critical but not performance limiting areas. Low voltages will be used in 
the non-critical areas of the design. Different voltages can be given to different areas like 
cache memory, CPU, Logic, memory and analog sections of the SoC [4] [14].  
 
2.4. Verifying the Low Power Intent of a Design: 
 
Various verification methodologies have been used in this project to explore the power 
intent. It is obvious that we will have to look into a variety of techniques used for 
performing the verification for power intent. The low power design architectures add 
more complexity to the verification of the system. There can be different modes of 
operation in a low power design and all the modes should be verified. Thus the 
verification space increases along with the increase in the number of modes. Certain 
features may not be available in all the modes. There should be a proper understanding 
of what features is valid in what mode. All the stake holders should agree on this, 
including the Architect, System designers, RTL designers and Verification engineers. The 
verification should be done in such a way that all the modes are entered and exited 
without any errors and all the legal transitions are checked. This is then finally 
documented with the intent of power architecture and communicated with all the stake 
holders. The following are various stages of verification. It should be noted that the 
following steps are only for verifying a system with respect to its low power behaviour 
[5]. 
 
2.4.1. Verification Plan: 
 
The verification plan in terms of low power design defines testing plan for all the power 
modes and scenarios and all the features in a mode. The various modes of operation and 
all the valid transitions with its priority are defined. The various conditions in which 
transitions can occur are defined. The various methods that cause a mode change like 
writing a register, response to external signals, effects of other transitions are defined. 
The coverage items should be planned. Tests for assertions to ensure power events 
happen only at legitimate times should also be included [2]. 
 
 2.4.2. Test benches: 
 
This part involves the creation of the advanced power aware test benches. This includes 
the important coverage and assertions which are to be covered. The various power 
modes and their sequences, the behaviour of the system during each mode, the 
verification of power control logic, the interfaces between the various domains, power 
management decisions, execution of the power management, system operation in each 
mode, and the interactions between domains and units [2].  
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
8 | P a g e   
 
2.4.3. Execution of Test Benches: 
 
The test benches are run formally and also involve simulation and emulation. During the 
execution care must be taken so as to cover all the possible states. To name a few, the 
interaction between the analog components, the transitions and the standby mode, the 
power OFF and power ON sequence, the interactions between the various domains, the 
power control module for the detailed domain level control  etc. 
 
2.4.4. Coverage Report and Analysis: 
 
A report has to be produced which consists of the coverage and the assertion coverage. 
This will include the reports from software, hardware and CPU point of view. The metrics 
should include the coverage of each domain state and transition, the assertion ensuring 
the proper state transitions, assertions and coverage of individual control signals. 
Generally the various states would be High, Low, Stand-by and OFF. The coverage should 
also include the unit level coverage where each unit can have multiple domains and also 
can have independent control of its power.  
 
2.4.5. Verification Closure: 
 
When all the planned features and the goals are met which are given in the plan, the 
verification can be closed. 
 
2.5. Common Power Format and EDA tools: 
 
The Ethernet SoC uses this format files for its low power intentions. Also, the usages of 
these techniques have increased in the industry. Hence it is necessary to have a good 
background study on this topic. Using the conventional design flow, the designers had to 
manually model the additional considerations to verify the impact of low power during 
their simulation stage. This involves multiple definitions for the same information again. 
These definitions for the low power model will involve another set of definitions for 
synthesis, placement, verification and equivalence checking. Ever after this there was no 
guarantee that what was verified really matched the design. This in turn affected the 
productivity, added more silicon failure, added more time to market the product etc [15]. 
 
The power information is available only on papers most of the time and is generally not 
available in the functional description. The information on what the power modes are, 
when a block can be turned off, when  block requires retention, where the level shifting 
is done, where should the isolation be inserted, what hierarchy should have what power 
supply are often not given in the functional description. This power intent should be 
separated from the implementation [3] [11]. 
 
This resulted in a need for a standard which can be reused for power saving. It should be 
available and introduced early in the design phase. This made way for the Common 
Power Format. The art and the techniques of the low power design styles will be 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
9 | P a g e   
 
enhanced by the Common Power Format [CPF]. By using the CPF, the power intent has to 
be given only once as it can be reused and understood by most of the tools. The Common 
Power Format is a special format file for specifying all the power saving techniques in the 
design phase [7] [9] [10]. 
 
The following are benefits of the CPF: 
 
• CPF helps the designers to find the optimal power specifications to achieve the 
desired specification. This lets the designers to find the way get the best trade-off 
when it comes to timing, area and power. 
• Unlike the conventional design flow, using CPF helps the teams to increase the 
productivity by avoiding repetitive tasks. 
• By using CPF the manual work done is reduced and it paves the way for 
automation. This joins hands with robust verification, thus eliminating the failure 
risks. 
• The RTL files when used in the conventional way needs to be modified each and 
every time for different power intent. The usage of CPF files will avoid this 
measure for RTL files. This paves way for design reuse. 
• The CPF is very easy to adopt and it also helps to overcome cost, time and 
deployment issues. 
• Using CPF also enables RTL functional verification which helps in validating the 
power related operation [15].

2.5.1. Using CPF for Power Intent: 
 
The usage of CPF separates the power intent from the RTL intent. This allows us to 
capture the power intent separately. Thus the full design requirement can be captured 
by capturing the power intent, design intent and the timing intent separately. The RTL file

can be instantiated different number of times and each may have a different CPF file with 
different power intent [7]. 
 
All the stages use the power intent specified in the CPF. The stages would be Design, 
Quality Check, Low power verification, Synthesis, Net list Checks, Equivalence checks, 
Test Design and Physical Implementation. 
 
Low power verification using CPF, basic stages: 
 
• The initial step would be the creation of the RTL file for the design intent and the 
creation of the CPF file for the power intent. Here the RTL file can be a reusable one 
since the CPF will take care of the power intent. 
• This step involves the verification of the contents of the CPF and the RTL code. They 
must be check so that they are syntactically correct. Check are also done so as to 
make sure that the design intent and the power intents are in alignment. 
• Now the system is check for its low power behaviour over its normal behaviour. Thus 
the functionality of the system is checked through simulation by super imposing the 
CPF with RTL. There will be control signals in the CPF for the isolation, retention and 
the power down. These control signals will be then generated in the power 
controller. Thus the low power behaviours can be generated by the assertions of the 
corresponding control signals. Now, different cases can be examined by just changes 
the CPF file for various power intents [2] [9] [25].  
 
2.5.2. Low Power Synthesis: 
 
We will have to perform the synthesis of the low power feature. Here the low power 
structures along with the same CPF file used in the simulation are synthesized.  During 
this stage the compiler adds the entire low power cells. The compiler does the following 
during synthesis, 
 
• The output of the power domain will be added with isolation cells 
• The specified input cells will be added with the isolation cells 
• The level shifters will be added to signals crossing the voltage domains 
• All flops will be replaced by the Retention flops in the specified locations 
 
During the simulation stage the virtual connections will be created. However during the 
synthesis phase these connections will be replaced by the RTL connections. Thus all the 
low power cells are connected as simulated which is also given in the CPF file [1]. 
 
2.5.3. Structural Checking: 
 
In the low power design the formal verification involves logical check as well as the 
verification based on low power intent.  
 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
11 | P a g e   
 
The logical checking involves the checking with respect to the logical correctness of the 
design where as the low power verification is about making sure that the circuit is 
electrically correct from a low power point of view. This will check if the retention and 
the isolation are with respect to the one given in the CPF file and they are complete.  
 
The logical checking should be capable of supporting the low power intent since the low 
power intent has added complexity due to the addition of isolation and the state 
retention cells. As we know that the isolation or retention cells are not present in the RTL 
and it is from the CPF, the tools should check if they have been inserted correctly and 
that if the generated net list is logically correct with respect to the RTL [15]. 
 
2.5.4. CPF Basic Definitions: 
 
Power Domains: 
 
Creation of power domains is the basic part in defining a CPF file. A power domain can 
fall in any of the following three types naming, unswitched domain, internal switchable 
domain, externally switchable domain [25]. 
 
Unswitched Domain: 
 
When a domain created is not required to be powered down by any controls in the scope 
in which the domain is created then it is said to be unswitched domain. The shutoff 
condition will not be specified for this type of domains [25]. 
 
Internal Switchable Domain: 
 
This power domain can be powered down. A power switch network will be used in this 
case to get the power supply from another domain. The shutoff condition will be 
mentioned in the CPF so as to power down. The power domain from which it gets the 
power will also have to be mentioned [25]. 
 
External Switchable Domain: 
 
This type of domains can be powered down by external switches which lie outside the 
chip. However, the external switch will have to be controlled by the signals on the chip 
itself. Here the condition which will cause the shut off will have to be mentioned 
together with a command saying that it will be external. The above mentioned power 
domains can be either a base/derived domain, primary/secondary domain [25]. 
 
Base and Derived Power Domains: 
 
A particular domain which can be any of the above three is said to be a base power 
domain of another power domain if the primary power and ground nets of this power 
domain provide the power supply through some switch network [25]. 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
12 | P a g e   
 
A standard cell instance can be created from a base power domain from which its 
primary  power supply and ground nets can be derived to provide the power supply to 
the power pin and the ground pin. This is said to be a derived domain [25]. 
 
Primary and Secondary Power Domains: 
 
A power domain is said to be a primary domain of a standard cell instance if the primary 
power as well as the primary ground nets provide the same to the cell. 
A power domain is said to be secondary domain of a low power instance if the primary 
power as well as the primary ground nets provide the power supply to the secondary 
power or secondary ground instance [25]. 
 
Power Modes: 
 
During a steady state of a design certain power domains are to be switched off and 
certain power domains are to be switched on which is called as power mode. A nominal 
condition is the one which specifies the voltages of all the power supplies given to the 
power domains. The power supply voltage and the ground voltage and even some times 
the PMOS, NMOS bias voltages will be specified in a nominal condition. Generally there 
can be three states, ON state, Standby state and OFF state. A power mode will be defined 
by specifying the above mentioned nominal condition for each mode [25]. 
 
2.5.5. Low Power Implementation using CPF and EDA: 
 
Low power implementation done using CPF and Electronic Design Automation tools 
consists of various steps in which the Gate level optimization, Multiple Vth optimization, 
Multiple Vdd optimization, power Shut off optimization and, dynamic voltage and 
frequency scaling optimization play an important role. Having seen the basic concepts, 
now let us explore how these can be implemented also using the CPF [7]. 
Here a brief explanation on how the CPF files can be used to implement the low power 
intent will be explained. There are certain features which will be taken care by the EDA 
and there are certain features which can be added through a CPF file. The CPF commands 
are explained wherever applicable [15]. 
 
Gate Level Optimization: 
 
The gate level optimization is considered to be the most basic in the implementation 
stage however the others are given importance in the synthesis stage. Even though clock 
gating is introduced in the synthesis stage, the designer will know the accurate 
placement of the cells, their routing distances and the physical distance only in the 
implementation stage. It is because of this, resizing, restructuring and pin swapping can 
be done more accurately in order to save power. Clock gating violations are due to the 
distance factor, i.e. when the clock gating cell is far away from the leaf cell. In the 
physical implementation stage the clock gating cells are just moved physically closer to 
the leaf cells. The EDA tools used these days are smart enough to clone the clock gating 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
13 | P a g e   
 
elements properly so as to avoid the timing violations since they know the distance 
between both the cells. Thus the best way to deal with the clock gating is to de-clone 
during the synthesis and then clone selectively during the implementation stage. Again, 
this can be automated [2]. 
 
Multiple Vth values: 
 
As mentioned, the usage of multiple Vth has become common when it comes to power 
intent. This needs a proper EDA tool which supports different Vth voltage libraries with 
the same cell functionality. When the value of Vth is high, it means that the cell is of low 
power and low performance and on the other hand if the Vth is low the cell power is high 
and so is the performance. Generally when the Vth is high the designer can save the 
power by up to eighty percent with a small increase in time delay. The EDA tool generally 
takes care of calculating the timing analysis and the cells can be easily interchanged 
during the layout stage [1] [12] [14]. 
 
Multiple Power Domains: 
 
This step is carried out in the initial stage of floor planning. There can be different power 
domains created which will have their own set of libraries according to the voltage 
domain [8] [14]. 
 
Implementation using CPF: 
The following CFP File description is used for the creation of multiple power domains [1].  
 
The CPF Representation: 
 
# Set the top domain 
set_design TOP 
 
# Set the default domain 
create_power_domain \ 
–name Top_Domain –default 
 
# Set Domain_A 
create_power_domain \ 
–name Domain_A \ 
–instances {uX uZ} 
 
# Define Domain_B – PSO when pso is low 
create_power_domain 
–name Domain_B\ 
–instances {uY} \ 
 
The lines which start with ‘#’ are the comments. The first command set_design is used to 
specify the top module. The command create_power_domain creates the power domain 
with a name given in the name command and it will also have the information about the 
pins in the command instances. The shut off condition can also be provided in the CPF. So 
here, the top module name is Top_Domain and the other two domains are Domain_A 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective

and Domain_B. the instances X and Z belongs to Domain_A and instance Y belongs to 
Domain_B. This structure can be represented as shown below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2.2 Multiple Power Domains obtained using the CPF File 
 
Placement and optimization: 
 
After creating the power domains, they have to be placed properly. Here the tools which 
can be used with the CPF will know the boundaries of each power domain defined. This is 
because of the reason that none of the logic should be moved from one domain to the 
other. Most of the EDA tools will know to use the appropriate timing libraries.  
 
Level shifting: 
 
All the signals crossing the power domains will have to be attached to a Level shifter. The 
Level shifting from higher voltage to lower voltage is generally optional. However the 
vice-versa is mandatory. This has become an automated task by using the CPF [7].

Implementation of Level Shifters using CPF: 
 
The Level Shifter is implemented using the create_level_shifter_rule command. The 
name of the Level shifter the start and destinations must be provided [1]. 
 
The CPF Representation: 
# Define Level-Shifters  
 
create_level_shifter_rule  
–name LS1 \ 
–to {Domain_B}  
–from {Domain_A} 
 
create_level_shifter_rule  
–name LS2 \ 
–to {Domain_A}  
–from {Domain_B} 
 
Power Shut Off (PSO): 
 
The Power Shut Off, also called as power gating is a low power design technique in which 
a certain part of the chip or a particular chip is shut off for saving power. This is one of 
most highly used and complex techniques used in the low power design. The 
implementation of the PSO can be done either as on-chip power shutoff or off-chip 
power shutoff. The implementation in which the power switch for the PSO is made within 
the SoC is called as on-chip PSO. The implementation in which the power switches are 
made external to the SoC is called as off-chip PSO. Power Shut Off can also be classified 
as,  
 
• Course Grained PSO 
• Fine Grained PSO 
 
When an entire chip is shutdown by using a single signal, it is called as course grained 
PSO. This can save power leakage during stand by or sleep mode. When power is shut 
down to a block or certain portions of a chip which allows the operation of other blocks, 
it is called fine grained PSO. 
 
Power domain will be defined in the CPF file and it is then implemented in such a way 
that the macros in the PSO reside in the correct physical area of the power domain and 
the macros which are not there in the CPF file reside outside the physical area. This is 
needed since the physical area is the one which decides if a macro is powered by a PSO 
or not. The power switch thus created can be inserted as a column or in a ring fashion.  
 
The CPF enables tools that will automatically insert the power domain. More power 
switches are required if the power domain is having more logic and area. The number of 
power switches should be optimal so that not too much of area is wasted or not too 
much of rush current is produced during wakeup [10]. 
 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
16 | P a g e   
 
Handling Rush Current: 
 
If the number of power switches is less it creates a rush current which happens during 
wake up. This can be reduced by the following ways [1]. 
• This can be reduced by the introduction of a delay. This delay can be introduced 
between when the power switch turns on. This will increase the turn on time of 
the PSO domain and the rush current can be reduced.  
• Another way of reducing the rush current is by arranging the power switches as a 
group and turning them on and off group wise. In this case, instead of a single 
power switch, only the first or last group will get the rush current.  
• There is also another way in which the switches have multiple enable pins. The 
smaller switch will be turned on first so that it gets almost 95% of the voltage.  
 
Adding Isolation cells: 
 
The isolation cells can generally be inserted by the tool during the synthesis provided the 
tool is capable of handling CPF. The isolation cells must be placed near the PSO. While 
inserting the isolation cells, proper care should be taken so that it is not placed in a 
wrong power domain. Care should be taken that they are connected to always ON power 
supply. The following is the CPF for the creation of Isolation Cells [1]. 
 
The CPF Representation: 
 
# It is for the output of Domain_B 
# isolated high on rising edge  
 
create_isolation_rule \ 
–name namex \ 
–from Domain_B \ 
–isolation_condition {“Condition are given here”} \ 
–isolation_output high \ 
–pins “pin names” 
 
The command create_isolation_rule is used to create the rules for the isolation cells. 
Here the name, the start location, the condition and the output are given in the CPF file. 
 
Adding State Retention: 
 
For the creation of state retention register, the regular registers will be transformed into 
state retention registers. This will take place during synthesis. The EDA or the designer 
should take care so that the extra space is allocated to place the additional power routing 
since both the switchable power supply and always-ON power supply is used for adding a 
state retention register. The state retention can be added using the CPF file and it is given 
as shown below with the create_state_retention_rule command [1]. 
 
 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective

The CPF Representation: 
 
# It is for storing for falling edge 
# and restoring on raising edge  
 
create_state_retention_rule \ 
–name namex \ 
–restore_edge {“signal_name”} \ 
-instances “list” 
 
Adding Always ON Buffer: 
 
The addition of PSO domain requires a buffer so that it can store few nets in this domain 
stays ON all the times. The voltage supplies will be through row and it gives continuous 
power for the regular buffers and a secondary power pin is used to keep the values in the 
Always ON buffers. This can also be handled during the physical implementation [1]. 
 
Adding Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS): 
 
The basic difference between the DVFS and the multiple Vdd is that in VDFS, any 
particular power domain will be able to operate at various modes. These modes will have 
their own supply voltages and frequencies. By using an advanced EDA tool the 
combinations of operating voltage and operating frequency can be optimized in parallel 
by totally automating the process.  The power benefits achieved here are way far better 
than the traditional optimization.  For e.g. a system can be designed in such a way that in 
active mode all the blocks operate in 125MHz and 1.08V and in the slow mode they 
operate at 66Mhz and 0.9V.  
 
The power modes representing the exclusive voltages can be represented using a CPF file 
and this will be used in supporting Dynamic Voltage Scaling and Dynamic Frequency 
Scaling. The CPF file will be as shown below [14] [1]. 
 
The CPF Representation: 
 
# Top_Domain is always high 
# Domain_A is medium or low 
# Domain_B is medium or low 
 
create_nominal_condition –name High_Vg \ 
–voltage 1.2

# Domain_A is off and Domain_B is Low 
 
create_power_mode –name Mode_Three \ 
–domain_conditions {Top_Domain@ High_Vg \ 
Domain_A@Zero_Vg Domain_B@Low_Vg} 
 
The command create_power_mode is used to create the power modes and 
create_nominal_condition is used to create_nominal_condition is used to create different 
voltage levels. There can be different mode created which depends on the various 
nominal conditions selected. 
 
The Ethernet SoC in this project uses CPF files for every module and it is then finally 
integrated. The study of CPF files present in the SoC helps to understand its power 
architecture better. So a proper understanding of CPF is required. Simvision, which is 
used in this project, helps us to view the power domain information and the power mode 
information as shown below. We find the CPU is in nominal condition and the voltage 
given according to the CPF file is 1.2V.

Project Design and Concepts 
 
3.1. Introduction: 
 
In this project, the e verification language is used for writing all the test cases and 
Specman is used as a tool for executing all our test cases. It is necessary that we go 
through how e verification language works and how it can be used with Specman. We 
have also used the latest concept in the verification industry, Open Verification 
Methodology. This chapter will take us through how this concept can be used in our 
project, implementing the hardware software co-verification. We will finally look into the 
hardware Device Under Test and an example program showing how the required data 
can be obtained for analysis. 
 
3.2. The e Verification Language and Specman: 
 
This section takes us through the working of e language with Specman Elite. 
 
3.2.1 The e Language Introduction: 
 
Initially, both Device Under Test (DUT) as well as the test environment were designed in 
VHDL or Verilog. In a typical RTL test environment, the test benches were written in RTL 
which then writes data into the DUT or read the data from the DUT. This approach has 
the following drawbacks, 
 
• Writing test cases became time consuming and it became very tedious since it 
was difficult to read and maintain. 
 
• It was hard to test the corner cases and testing the robustness was difficult. 
 
• Creating and maintaining the test environment became difficult since they had 
little shared code. 
 
This paved way for an object oriented verification language with random generation, and 
a test bench tool which could reduce the effort for creating a test environment. This 
complete verification automation system will help increase the overall productivity of the 
verification [16] [17] [18]. 
 
A Complete Verification Automation System: 
 
A complete verification automation system will help us with stimuli generation, driving 
stimulus, collecting the output, data checking and coverage measurement. Here we 
concentrate on the e verification language and the Specman Elite tool which forms a 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
20 | P a g e   
 
complete verification automation system since it will be used throughout this project [16] 
[17] [18]. 
 
Data Object in e: 
 
A struct represents a data object in e verification language. This represents one stimulus. 
The Specman Elite contains a random stimulus generator which is capable of generating a 
random value for a stimulus which will depend on the constraints given by the 
verification engineer [16]. 
 
Stimuli Generation: 
 
The generation of stimuli is automated in e Language. The verification engineers will be 
able to provide the constraints which are derived from the specifications. The constraints 
will also depend on the test cases to define the test case. When a DUT is presented with 
an illegally constructed data it will discard it by not involving the design [16]. 
 
Driving the Stimulus: 
 
The e Language allows us to create drivers in an object oriented way. These drivers help 
us to drive the test vectors created during the stimuli generation into the DUT. The driver 
should be able to provide an interface with the simulator, obey the rules to the provided 
input protocol for the DUT, convert the abstract data structure to bits and drive them to 
the DUT. A unit represents a driver object in e. However, it does not move through the 
verification system unlike the struct does [17] [18]. 
 
Collecting output: 
 
The output produced from the DUT after the injection of the stimulus should be collected 
and checked. Receivers can be created in e language for this purpose and this involves in 
creation of an interface with the simulator which should be able to recognize the output 
protocol for DUT and receive the bits. It should also covert the received bits into an 
abstract data structure for further checking. unit is used to collect the output [16] [17]. 
 
Data Checking: 
 
The data received from the DUT should be checked which can be of two types namely 
data value check and the data timing check. In value check, the bits produced from the 
DUT are compared against the expected data. In timing check, the system is checked for 
any protocol violation [16] [17]. 
 
Measuring Coverage: 
 
The coverage measurement is done so as to find if the test plan goals have been met or 
not. It also enables us to, check if all the legal values of variables have been covered, 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
21 | P a g e   
 
check for all the legal transitions of a state machine, and finally check the combinations 
of basic coverage under different states [16]. 
 
3.2.2. Interaction between the Specman and Simulator: 
 
Simulator and Specman are two different processes which talk to each other by means of 
an interface and run concurrently and synchronize with each other during the simulation 
stage. There is a special file called the stub file through which both simulator and 
Specman communicate to each other. The verification environment contains the 
components required for verification in the form of e language. These files will be 
compiled and simulated. The simulator on the other hand compiles and simulates all the 
files in VHDL or Verilog. In this project, all the files are in Verilog. 
 
During invocation, the Specman and Simulator are invoked at the same time. The 
Specman then gains control and the Simulator will stop the simulation at the time zero. 
The simulation will be then started by explicitly giving control to the Simulator. The 
control will be passed back to the Specman according to e code set by the verification 
engineer. After doing the necessary computations the Specman then passes the control 
to Simulator. This happens till a procedure in the Specman is called which completes the 
simulation [16] [17] [18]. 
 
3.3 Open Verification Methodology: 
 
This section gives us an introduction to the Open Verification Methodology and the 
various parts and construction of Universal Verification Components which are 
extensively used in this project.   
 
3.3.1. Introduction: 
 
Cadence Design Systems and Mentor Graphics jointly introduced the concept of Open 
Verification Methodology, popularly known as OVM. The OVM is an open source 
verification methodology which has been architected for multiple languages. The OVM 
libraries provide methodologies to match the test benches which are regardless of the 
implementation language. The concept of OVM provides a standard transaction level 
communication channel which can be used to exchange information between different 
languages [19].   
 
The Open Verification Methodology is used for creating a verification environment which 
maximizes the reusability of the code so that it can be used for different projects which 
can involve mixed languages. The methodology of OVM shows us how to achieve code 
reusability by using well known methods for designing, coding and packaging [19].  We 
have used many UVCs in this project and the important ones will be discussed in the 
section 3.6. Also, we will discuss an important UVC that we use in this project, The 
Ethernet UVC on section 3.3.3. Since the focus of this project is on achieving low power, 
we will be concentrating only on the basics of OVM and UVCs in the sections below. 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
22 | P a g e   
 
The OVM Test Benches: 
 
An OVM Verification environment is made up of reusable Universal Verification 
components called UVCs (Universal Verification Components). OVM supports UVCs to be 
written in e language, System Verilog or the combination of both. OVM also supports 
SystemC. OVM provide us a standard for the planning, configuration and standard debug 
message formats [19]. 
 
3.3.2. Universal Verification Components for OVM: 
 
UVC forms the basis for an OVM verification environment. It is a ready-to-use, 
completely encapsulated verification environment which is configurable. It is generally 
used for an interface protocol or sometimes for a full system. UVCs can be used with e, 
System Verilog, VHDL or SystemC. An UVC will contain a complete set of basic elements 
for the purpose of simulation, coverage collection and checking for a specific protocol or 
a specific architecture [19].  
 
Compared to the normal verification environment, an UVC can be used in more than one 
setting. Many UVCs can be combined to produce a new UVC provided there are no name 
clashes between them. Following the best practices (according to the OVM) will avoid 
any kind of conflicting situations.  The concept allows us to use the UVCs as a plug and 
play component. Building a new verification environment should be easy and this new 
combined environment can also become a new UVC which in future can be plugged so as 
to create a bigger verification environment. Generally commercial UVCs come in an 
encrypted form so as to protect the company’s intellectual property. The UVCs can also 
be extended to add more functionality which is generally done in a separate file [19].  
 
Components and Types of UVCs: 
 
The UVCs can be categorized into three types according to their architecture and the 
OVM guidelines. The basic building block of an OVM environment is the interface UVC.  
The Module UVCs are the ones used for integrating the interface UVCs with other 
verification components which are required for verification [19].  
 
Interface UVCs: 
 
Interface UVCs are the ones which interact directly with the DUT. They are made up of 
several components and they focus on a specific protocol such as TCP/IP, Ethernet etc. 
Generally an interface consists of the following components. 
 
Agents: An UVC will have at least one Agent. An agent consists of a driver, sequencer and 
a bus monitor. UVCs may also have more than one agent which may have various 
operating modes. In active mode, the agent drives and monitors the interface. In passive 
mode, the agent only monitors the interface where as the driving aspects are turned off. 
There can also be protocol specific agents.  
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
23 | P a g e   
 
Drivers: A driver is the one which interacts with the DUT by driving, sampling the DUT 
signal and also it converts all the transactions into the format required by the DUT.  
 
Sequencer: A sequencer is used to generate the stimulus data which will be then passed 
to the driver for further execution. A sequencer will be able to generate a single 
transaction or a sequence of transactions which will be used to form a more properly 
structured stimulus. 
 
Bus Monitors: The tester and the other components have to understand the signal 
information. The bus monitor does this job. It extracts the signal information from the 
bus and then it translates them into events and/or status information. The bus monitor 
has a component called the checker which checks the protocol and the data and thus 
verifies that the DUT produces the right output. The bus monitor also does the coverage 
collection [19].  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.1 UVC Agent 
 
The diagram above shows all the components of an UVC and shows how they interact 
with a device under test. The other types of UVC generally called the system UVC and 
monitor UVC are discussed below. 
 
Module and System UVCs: 
 
A system UVC will be used to do a system level verification. They will be using interface 
UVCs for connecting to the system interface and module UVCs which can be a sub-
system of currently verified system. A system UVC generally does not have its own agents 
whereas it instantiates other UVCs and connects them so as to create a verification 
environment. A smaller system UVC is generally called as Module UVC.

A system UVC contains the following which is similar to interface UVCs. 
 
Monitor: This collects all the information and most of them will be collected from the 
interface UVC’s monitor. 
 
Virtual Sequencers: They are connected to the sequencers of the interface UVCs and the 
module UVCs. 
 
Scoreboard: Scoreboard is the one which receives the inputs from the interface UVCs. It 
is always a good practice to have as scoreboard in a system UVC [19]. 
 
Further exploration into UVCs and its creation rules will be out of scope of this project. In 
this project we also use the e UVCs, called as eVCs, ready to use and configurable. We 
now proceed with the Ethernet UVC in the next section. 
 
3.3.3. The Ethernet UVC: 
 
The Ethernet UVC that we use in this project is a ready-made and highly configurable e 
Verification Component (eVC). This UCV is capable of generating Ethernet packets and 
random data packets. It is also able to drive the generated packets according to the 
protocol which comes with a protocol checker for the DUT to make sure that the DUT 
follows the Ethernet protocol. 
 
The monitor present here is completely passive and the Bus Functional Model (BFM) 
generates the data packets. Most of the passive activities of the UVC are done by the 
monitor and the active activities like the interactions with the DUT are done by the BFM. 
The monitor also does the protocol checks and is used in the coverage collection which is 
predefined in this UVC. 
 
The Ethernet UVC comes with a scoreboard as explained in the previous section. This is 
used to check if the number and the order of the data that are collected from the DUT 
are matching with the expected result. This scoreboard functionality is optional. 
However, in this project we have enabled the scoreboard option so that we verify and 
collect the necessary information for a working System. We will not go deep into the 
construction of this Ethernet UVC as it is a commercially available component which can 
be used to verify any Ethernet Systems [23]. 
 
3.4. Hardware and Software Co-Verification: 
 
This project involves the power analysis of the hardware as well as the software which 
brings us the need to study more on hardware and software co-verification. We will be 
using metric driven, constrained-random stimulus to verify the overall power [20]. In this 
section we will look into the various ports used for the interaction between hardware 
and the software. In general, this verification involves three major components,

25 | P a g e   
 
The Device Under Test: 
 
While performing the hardware software analysis the following sections of the DUT 
should be taken into consideration. The device hardware (developed in Verilog), the 
lower level system software (developed in C) and hardware software interface 
(developed in C).  
 
The Software UVC: 
 
Software UVC created will be a self contained verification component for a certain 
purpose which simulates the system software. It should allow higher level coordination 
with the hardware UVC to stress the hardware, by providing automatic checking to 
ensure the functionality of the DUT. The software UVC controls the flow of the system 
software by checking its mailbox. This mailbox is used to check for the function to call 
next when the system software starts running. When the function gets completed, the 
return value is stored in the mailbox for the verification environment to retrieve.  
 
Connecting DUT and Software UVC: 
 
The software UVC uses various ports to connect to the DUT. The following are the various 
ports used when it comes to co-verification [20]. 
 
Method Ports: 
 
These ports are used to create connections between the UVCs and the system software. 
There are two types of method ports, outgoing method ports and incoming method 
ports. The outgoing ports are used by the UVCs so as to call the functions in the 
embedded software. The parameters of the outgoing method ports can be randomized 
so as to allow maximum investigation of the software. On the other hand, the incoming 
method ports are called by the system software like normal functions [20].  
 
Monitor Ports: 
 
Software functions need instrumentations so as perform checking and coverage. This 
functionality can be performed by using the monitor ports. Monitor ports are used to 
notify the verification environment when an internal software function is called; this in 
turn helps us to check the function’s parameter or its return value. It is also used to 
monitor the internal local variables. Cadence software helps us to create the very first 
method port by creating wrapper functions. These wrapper functions can be simply used 
in the user source code. This will call the verification environment with the function’s 
argument or the function’s return value [20]. 
 
 
 
 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
26 | P a g e   
 
Simple Ports: 
 
The simple ports are used to create a connection between the system software variables 
and the UVC. They are defined as bi-directional, so that they will be able to read and 
write software variables. The outgoing simple port allows the UCV to write to the 
software variables. An incoming simple port helps the UVC to read the software variable. 
They are generally used to check the functionality of the DUT and to report the status 
back to the UVC [20].  
 
Event Ports: 
 
When the value of a software environment is changed, the event port helps us to call the 
UVC. This triggering of the software UVC by the event port will be useful when the UVC 
sequence is to be maintained [20]. 
 
3.5. The Device Under Test: 
 
In this section we will look into the detailed block diagram of the SoC and the Address 
Look-up Table. 
 
3.5.1. The System Block Diagram: 
  
The following is the device which has been taken for our hardware software verification 
for the maximum power utilization. It has been developed in Verilog [2]. 
 
 
Figure 3.2 The System Block Diagram 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
27 | P a g e   
 
As shown in the block diagram below, the test hardware platform uses the Advanced 
Microcontroller Architecture Buses (AMBA). The protocols used here are the Advanced 
High Performance Bus (AHP) and the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB). The AHB is used 
connect the inbuilt Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), Static Memory Controller 
(SMC), OR1K processor, Ethernet and the VCO.  
 
The other two major blocks are the APB connected Subsystem 1 and Subsystem 2. The 
Subsystem 1 has the Universal Asynchronous Synchronous Receiver Transmitter, General 
Purpose Input Output (GPIO) and Power Control Module (PCM). They are connected 
together by the APB. The Subsystem 2 has the Advanced Look-up Table (ALUT) which is 
of our interest. The ALUT will be storing the addresses of the ports and it will be used as a 
look-up table so as to increase the data transfer rate. The ALUT operation will be 
explained in detail in a different section.  
 
Firmware Block Diagram: 
 
The firmware of the verification block has the components which include device driver 
for power manager, device driver for the MACs, a system controller and the applications 
programs.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.3 Block diagram of the Firmware, Cadence Verification Kit [2] 
The system has got three major firmware blocks. (i)The device driver layer consists of the 
drivers for MAC and the power manager. (ii) The system controller provides the power 
management autonomously to the hardware. (iii) The final block is the Ethernet switch 
application layer which comes with high level power management state machines. While 
using the software version of the look-up table, the C programming language version of 
the look-up table will be loaded from the firmware [2].

3.5.2. The ALUT Block: 
 
The ALUT block is in the second APB subsystem and it is connected to all the four 
Ethernet MACs. The look-up table uses the RAM and has the following data entries which 
include the address bits, port bits, last accessed bits, and a valid bit. The ALUT performs 
address check as well as the age check in which address checking is of our interest [21].

                           Figure 3.4 ALUT Block Diagram 
ALUT Address checking functionality: 
 
There is a register in which the current operation to be performed is mentioned whether 
it is address check or the age check, called the command register. This register should be 
issued with a check address command for using the ALUT. 
 
There are 256 entries in the SRAM for the ALUT. The different fields in one 83 bit entry is 
as shown below, 
 
 
 
  
 
Figure 3.5 Look-up Table entries bitwise 
 
The checking operation is initially done by comparing the input destination address and 
the stored MAC switch address. If there is a mismatch then the checking will be done for 
the input destination address against the values stored in the memory. The functionality 
uses a hash conversion and the 48 bit address will be changed to 8 bits.  
 
A hash is generated corresponding to the current frame destination address and this is 
used to check the look-up table. If there is a match with the look-up table, the 
corresponding entry will be loaded into the current destination port. Else, the current 
destination port will be loaded with all the ports except the current source port. A hash

will also be generated for the source address and will be loaded into the look-up table. 
This is done by writing the address of the source frame, the current source port, time it 
was accessed and a valid bit as 1 [21]. 
 
This functionality of the Address Look-up Table is defined in RTL for the hardware version 
of the ALUT and is written in C for the software version of the ALUT. Having looked into 
the construction and the functionality of the ALUT, we move to the next section on how 
to create a verification environment for this DUT. 
 
3.6. Verification Environment and the DUT: 
 
We will be analyzing the SOC using this verification environment which comprises of a 
number of hardware interface UVCs, software UVC, one UVC for the hardware software 
interaction and a top level system environment. This also includes the DUT. The following 
sections will be used to explain the individual UVCs [22]. 
 
The Top level UVC: cdn_socv: 
 
This top level verification environment is the one which is used to instantiate all other 
individual UVCs and extend them for our verification purpose [22]. 
 
The HW/SW interface UVC: cdn_hw_sw: 
 
The purpose of this module is to interface the hardware and the software. This UVC 
consists of a virtual sequence driver, a monitor and a set of scoreboard. This module is 
used for two main purposes, the hardware software interface and the hardware software 
switch. This uses the basic concept explained in section 3.4. 
 
The hardware software interface is used to transfer and check the data between the 
hardware interface and the SOC’s internal memory. A scoreboard is instantiated for all 
the data transfer direction supported by the DUT. The following are the possible 
directions which include, data transfer from hardware interface to the memory in the 
DUT, data transfer from the memory in the DUT to the hardware interface, internal data 
transfer within the DUT memory. Data addition to the scoreboard and data checking 
from the scoreboard is enabled by a method port.  
 
The hardware software switch is used to extend the filtering functionality implemented 
within the DUT by extending the Ethernet UVC [22]. 
 
The Software UVC: cdn_software: 
 
This UVC contains a set of method calls which is used to activate the embedded 
processor (0R1K) through the generic software adapter. The hardware software UVC 
extends the cdn_software UVC so as to enable the sequences necessary to perform the 
co-verification [22].  
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
30 | P a g e   
 
The Ethernet UVC: vr_enet: 
 
The Ethernet UVC is commercially available and it is used in this project by extending its 
sequence library so as to restrict the testing to basic Ethernet frames [22]. The Ethernet 
UVC has been explained in the section 3.3.3. 
 
The Software: 
 
The Software is written in C and it is compiled using the open RISC GNU tool chain. The 
compiled library is loaded into the DUT’s memory and it runs on the OR1K processor. This 
software provides a C hardware driver for each peripheral in the DUT. The software UVC 
is used to control both the configuration methods and the control methods of the 
software.  
 
The hardware can be configured by using the configuration methods. The configuration 
methods write to the registers in the peripheral so as to control the hardware. They also 
help in setting up the internal software state. 
 
A transfer can be initiated by using the control methods. They write to the peripherals to 
do any transfers. There are two types of transfer. In the first type, the peripheral 
continue with the transfer without the software and then it interrupts the software after 
completion. In the other method, the software will copy or read the data into or from the 
FIFO. The peripheral will raise interrupt only when the FIFO needs any attention [22].  
 
3.7. Benchmark Programs: 
 
3.7.1 Introduction: 
 
This section provides information on how the project has been designed and planned for 
executing the test cases. This section also gives an example test program with the 
information on how to run the test and collect the required data for further analysis. 
 
3.7.2. Test Cases Flow Chart: 
 
The flow chart explains how the tests are done. The tests are done on hardware ALUT 
and the software ALUT and the test cases will be similar. All the ports on the Ethernet 
MAC will be used for every test case. The test cases can be done using random seeds and 
mainly under two categories with ALUT empty and the ALUT full.  
 
As mentioned above, the number of entries in the ALUT is 256. After completing the test 
cases the power information is collected in a TCF file through the dumptcf command in 
the Specman. This TCF file will be used for getting the power information. The detailed 
construction, procedure for executing the test cases, and collecting the outputs will be 
explained in the coming sections.

understanding of the flow.

3.7.3. A Test Case snippet: 
The test cases are written in e language and it uses the Ethernet UVC to create the 
Ethernet traffic. The data length, the number of frames and the maximum number of 
entries in ALUT can be changed in the Test cases. The following is a snippet of a test case. 
For test cases, please refer the information provided in the Appendices section.

Figure 3.7 A section of a test case 
 
The above test case imports the top level verification environment UVC which belong to 
the cdn_socv UVC. The purpose of including this is to enable the switching functionality 
of the DUT.  
 
The system has four Ethernet ports and each of them is attached to a segment for the 
network. These segments can have multiple Ethernet ports connected to them which are 
called as stations. The number of stations created can be controlled in the test cases. For 
this we have to extend hardware software sequence driver which has a variable to 
control the maximum number of stations per port. Hardware software sequence driver 
has been extended to increase the number of stations that can be used in a port. Here, it 
has been increased to 4. This means that the number of entries in the ALUT will be to a 
maximum of 4X4 = 16 entries. 
 
The number of frames has been set to five and the maximum length has been set to 120. 
Now let us see how this test case can be simple loaded using irun command after 
providing information about the locations of the directories in a script file. 
 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
33 | P a g e   
 
3.7.4. Executing the Test Cases: 
All the test cases can be simple run by using irun command in the command window. The 
following shows how the example test case shown above can be executed. 
 
irun_or1k_gnu.csh -seed 1000 -mode interactive_debug -lp -test Example_Testcase.e 
 
The irun command format shown in the table is used for executing most of the test cases. 
The irun_or1k_gnu.csh is a script file in which we have included the details of the all the 
file locations which includes the design topology, HDL files, topology defines, CPF 
constraints, verification environment, work directory etc. The one after the keyword seed 
selects the seed which can be any number or the keyword random which selects a 
random seed. The tests are executed in an interactive debug mode which is set by using 
the command interactive_debug. The –lp enables the low power testing. Finally the test 
case name is given at the end. Please note that the irun script file is placed in the work 
directory. If it is present in a different location the complete path has be present before 
the file name. Executing this command will bring up Simvision, Simulator, Specman, 
Waveform window and the Design Browser. The test case starts running after issuing the 
run command in the Simulator tab. 
 
3.7.5. Accessing the ALUT information: 
 
 
Figure 3.8 Design Browser showing the hierarchy of the design 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
34 | P a g e   
 
The ALUT is a 2-dimension array named mem_core_array, present in the ALUT module to 
hold 256 entries of 83 bit information which is explained in the ALUT block section.  This 
can be tracked down using the Design Browser which opens along with the Simvision. 
The Design Browser shows the memory location and its hierarchy. The snapshot shown 
as figure 3.6 explains the hierarchy clearly.  
 
tb_socv -> u_socv -> i_apb_subsystem_1 - > i_alut_veneer -> i_alut -> i_alut_mem.  
 
The snapshot shows the individual array elements present in the ALUT. This lets us to 
explore all the variables and their hierarchy. However there is a drawback depending on 
the Design Browser directly due to the fact that we will not be able to access the 2-D 
array elements directly. This brings us to the usage of probes for this particular array. 
When a variable is probed, all the changes in its values will be recorded into a database 
and these values can be taken for viewing later. Also, this allows the waveform window 
to show the values of the ALUT. This can also be accessed using the Memory viewer 
provided the variable has been probed issuing the command below. 
                                                                                                                                                                       
probe -create tb_socv.u_socv.i_apb_subsystem_1.i_alut_veneer.i_alut.i_alut_mem –waveform

 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective

When a run command is issued, the execution starts with initialization and then proceeds 
with the data transfer. This data transfer can be observed in the log information in the 
Simulator and can also be observed through the waveform window.  
 
It can be seen that only less than 16 entries have had happened in the ALUT memory. 
This is due to the restriction given in the Test case through the variable 
max_stations_per_port. The ALUT is designed in such a way that when it wants a new 
entry to be done and there is less number of locations to write, it simply reuses then 
previous locations. All these can be observed in the snapshot. 
 
To ease the viewing of the ALUT, it is possible to check them through the Memory 
Viewer. It is to be noted that these possible viewings can happen only when a probe is 
created. This type of view helps us to find the number of ALUT entries very easily 
compared to the other type of views. A snapshot of the Memory Viewer for our sample 
test case is as shown below which clearly shows the current status of the ALUT with its 
values displayed. 
 
 
Figure 3.10 Memory window showing the look-up table live 
 
3.7.6. Enabling the Software ALUT: 
 
The software ALUT can be enabled by updating the firmware. The variable present in the 
system.c file will be changed. The variable EnableSwAlut will be set to TRUE so that the 
software look-up table is enabled. The system will not consider the hardware block for 
any look ups when this variable is set to TRUE. 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
36 | P a g e   
 
The functionality for the look is performed by the file called AlutDriver in which the 
software is written in C programming language. This performs the same function that the 
hardware performs. 
 
3.8. Expected Results: 
 
The above test case should give us the number of ALUTs filled for a traffic of 15 frames 
and the toggle information and the number of high states for a particular point of time as 
well as for the whole run time. Now, what information can we get from the toggle file 
and the high states? They provide us the complete details on the number of high states 
during the test.  This will give us the information on how many how many regions have 
gone active which will consume power. 
 
This data can be taken by using the Dynamic Power Analysis (DPA) capability of the 
Cadence Palladium Emulator. The inputs would be the Toggle Count Format (TCF) file and 
the information from the ports. The results will be on a database file representing the 
number of high states and the number of toggle for each and every point of time. This 
information will show the power consumption of the hardware and the software 
embedded ALUT. As we know that in this example file we are considering the hardware 
ALUT, the next chapter will take us through the steps on how to get these data and how 
the analysis can be done. 
 
We expect the hardware version of the look-up table to consume more power when 
compared to the software version. Also, the hardware version is expected to be faster 
compared to the software version. We will come to know the results only after the 
successful runs of all the test cases.

Analysis of Work 
 
4.1. Introduction: 
 
In this chapter we will look into how each test is performed and how the data are 
collected. Then, we will move into the analysis part for all the results obtained. The 
analysis will be done on performance wise and as well as power wise. 
 
4.2. Collecting Toggle Count Format File: 
 
For performing the power analysis, we need to generate the Toggle Count Format (TCF) 
file after the simulation. The TCF is a standard developed by Cadence to describe the 
activities happening during switching. For accurate power analysis of a design, this 
switching activity information file is required.  
 
The switching activity information file called as TCF, contains the toggle information 
indicating how often a pin or a net switch switches between its logic 1 and logic 0. It also 
provides us the probability of the pin or net switch being in logic state 1 which is given by 
the total time in logic state 1 divided by the total time during the TCF dump.  
 
The TCF file can be extracted by using the command dumptcf in the simulator. In our 
example test file the dump command is given in the following way. 
 
ncsim> dumptcf –output Example_Testcase.tcf                                                                                                           
 
The following is a part of the TCF file taken from Simvision which will be used for further 
analysis. The following is for the alut_mem instance.

4.3. Collecting information from ports: 
 
The information on the destination address port (d_addr[47:0]), source address port 
(s_addr[47:0]) and the port number (s_port[1:0]) are collected and these data are stored 
in a comma separated values format file by using the export option in Simvision. These 
values are collected for every lookups and they are present under the instance 
i_alut_addr_checker.  
 
The reason for extracting and exporting the values of only d_addr, s_addr and the s_port 
is that they are used in the hash conversion and these three data are the ones that 
decide in writing a value to the ALUT. The alut_addr_checker.v performs the look-up 
based on these values.

4.4. Performing the Toggle Count Analysis: 
 
The toggle count analysis is performed using the Palladium Emulator from Cadence that 
provides us the database which gives all the high states and the toggle information for all 
the modules selected. This information is enough for us to understand the power 
consumption data.  
 
Incisive Palladium Dynamic Power Analysis: 
 
We use the Incisive Palladium for identifying, capturing and analyzing the power 
switching activity. This allows us to perform the trade-offs between power and 
performance in a realistic system level environment. This tool is generally used to for 
peak identification, average power calculation for longer runs, Toggle Count Analysis 
(TCA) for data processing and filtering and it also supports CPF. One of the major 
advantages of using this tool is that it supports both RTL and gate level power estimation. 
We use the RTL based power estimation for our Ethernet IP [24]. 
 
In our research, we use only the Toggle Count Analyzer feature of the Palladium emulator 
for the data processing. This has got the ability to process our input data mentioned in 
the previous section and give us the toggle count and the high count, which we can 
directly use as a power consumption data.

4.5. Test Cases: 
 
In this section we move on to the main test cases. According to the flowchart mentioned 
we have two main branches of test cases. First one will concentrate on filling the ALUT to 
the maximum. And the second one will concentrate on filling the ALUT to the minimum. 
We will analyze the test results in this section. Both of these tests are done with respect 
to both, the software and the hardware algorithm.  
 
The step by step approach for test cases will not be provided as the previous sections 
clearly explain how to create the test benches, run the tests and collect the data with an 
example. 
 
4.5.1. Filling the look-up table as much as possible: 
 
In this test case we will generate the traffic in such a way that the look-up table gets 
more entries and we will analyze the power for both the hardware and the software 
design flow. 
 
The test cases extend the hw_sw_sequence_driver so as to select the maximum number 
of ports. This is achieved by giving the appropriate values for the variable 
max_stations_per_port whose default value is given as 2. This variable is declared under 
the file cdn_hw_sw_switch.e. 
 
The test cases also extend the hw_sw_sequence so as to provide new values for the data 
length and the number of frames to be transmitted. The variables for selecting them are 
declared under the file cdn_hw_sw_sequence_lib.e  
 
The basic constructions of these are explained under the hardware software co-
verification section and also under the section Verification environment and the DUT. The 
detailed development of the file cdn_hw_sw_sequence_lib.e and cdn_hw_sw_switch.e 
will not be explained as it will be out of scope considering the aim of the project. Instead, 
the end product, test case file has been explained. 
 
The test case one and test case two will be having the same e file as its test case file. 
However, they will be executed under two different modes of the ALUT. 
 
Test 1: Testing with the Hardware ALUT: 
 
The Hardware ALUT is enabled by setting the variable EnableSwAlut as FALSE so that the 
system does not take the software ALUT into account and works with the hardware ALUT 
which is written in Verilog. This is done before the software image was loaded into the 
memory.

Figure 4.6 Test case on hardware ALUT considering maximum entries in look-up 
This test case is designed in such a way that the system uses the maximum number of 
ALUTs and the number of frames is set to 1000. The test case was run in a similar way 
and the data are collected for the overall system, the ALUT module, CPU Module and the 
SRAM module as shown in the snapshot below. The frame size was fixed with a 
maximum size of 50.  
 
The following is the data obtained after running this test and capturing the data. The 
following shows the number of high states and the number of toggle activity happened 
during the run in Palladium Emulator.

Test 2: Testing with the Software ALUT: 
The Software ALUT is enabled by setting the variable EnableSwAlut as TRUE so that the 
system does takes the hardware ALUT into account and works with the software ALUT 
which is written in C. This is done before the software image was loaded into the 
memory. We have set the number of frames as 1000 as given in the hardware test. The 
test case was run in a similar way and the data are collected for the overall system, the 
ALUT module, CPU module and the SRAM module as shown in the snapshot below. The 
frame size was fixed with a maximum size of 50. This test case is exactly the same as the 
one ran for the hardware ALUT expect for the fact that this will be performed using the 
software ALUT.

4.5.2. Tests: Filling the ALUT as less as possible: 
 
In this test case we will generate the traffic in such a way that the look-up table gets less 
information and we will analyze the power for both the hardware and the software 
design flow. 
 
This test case is done according to the ALUT hashing algorithm and thus it is designed to 
create a maximum number of evictions in the look-up table. This test helps us identify 
the power consumption between the hardware and the software considering the fullness 
of the ALUT which is related to workload of the ALUT. 
 
Test 3: Testing with Hardware ALUT: 
 
This Test case differs from the previous test cases for the fact that we have added 
functionality in our test case to evict the ALUT entries. The hardware ALUT is enabled in a 
similar way by setting the variable EnableSwAlut as FALSE so that the system works with 
the hardware ALUT.

4.6. Power Analysis: 
 
Having done all the test cases, we have got enough data to perform the analysis. The 
results will be analyzed separately for the test cases depending on the ALUT entries. 
 
4.6.1. Filling the look-up table as much as possible: 
 
Considering the hardware and software versions of the ALUT, let us summarize the 
values obtained to see which version has consumed more power when the ALUT got 
filled to the maximum.

Figure 4.17 Table representing the overall values for test 1 and test 2 
 
Analysis of Test 1 and Test 2: 
 
Considering the Test 1 and Test 2, we have filled the look-up table and have observed the 
high states and the toggle counts using the Emulator for both the software version and 
the hardware version. The values in the above table representing the values have been 
colour coded to represent the ones in green to show that they have taken less power and 
the ones in red to show that they have consumed more power. 
 
ALUT Module: 
 
Let us begin our detailed analysis with the hardware ALUT module. The hardware version 
of the ALUT has got an average of 698.2 high states overall, which is higher than the 
software version having only 622.2. This shows that the ALUT block during the hardware 
has consumed more power compared to the run with the software version. 
 
Even though the hardware is having more high states compared to the software, 
considering the difference, the hardware has taken less numbers. This is because, during 
the run with the software version of the ALUT, the ALUT block in system (RTL) does not 
perform any operation and the numbers shown for software are only due to the clocking 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
50 | P a g e   
 
happened. This can be avoided by gating technology as discussed in the section 2.3. We 
will look more into this in our critical analysis section. 
 
Looking into the construction of both the hardware and software versions of the look-up 
table design we find that in the software version, all the functionalities which includes 
the hash key generation, age checker, address checker and others basic functions are all 
included in a file called the AlutDriver.c which also acts as the firmware for our system.  
 
The hardware version of the look-up table which has got separate files to perform every 
operation, takes up additional size in the overall hardware. As a conclusion, for a data 
transfer, with the use of the look-up table, the hardware version takes up more power 
compared to the software version. 
 
SRAM Module: 
 
From the tables it is clear that using the hardware version consumes more power in the 
SRAM module when compared while using the software version of the look-up table. This 
is due to the fact that the hardware block has to perform the data transfer through the 
APB and the AHB route which is clear from the block diagram.  
 
The data transfer will be from the second APB-Subsystem to the on-chip memories which 
happens from ALUT to APB to bridge to AHB and then to the Memory. Considering this 
aspect, using the hardware ALUT is not a good option when saving power is considered. 
We will analyze in detail how we can overcome this problem which is with respect to the 
positioning of the ALUT module, in the critical analysis section. 
 
Processor Module: 
 
The processor module is one of the important modules to be considered since the entire 
system’s performance depends on this module. As mentioned in the block diagram, we 
are using the OR1K processor which is connected through the AHB to the other parts of 
the system. The software and hardware versions of ALUT may have different workloads 
for the processor module which in turn will consume more or less power. We will look in 
detail the power consumption by the processor (CPU) module. 
 
Acting differently when compared with the previously analyzed modules, where the 
hardware consumes more power, here, the software consumes more power for 
processor. The value for the high states average is 1767.4 for the hardware which is far 
less than the value 1881.7 obtained while using the software version. This clearly shows 
that the power and the workload given to the processor is more when we use the 
software version. 
 
This extra load and power consumed is due to the fact that the software version of the 
ALUT does all its operation through the OR1K processor since it doesn’t have any 
dedicated block of its own. On the other hand the hardware version performs all its 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
51 | P a g e   
 
calculations and the checking using its own dedicated hardware. This, in turn reduces the 
workload given to the processor and hence the power consumed is also low. However, 
are there any advantages of using software version which gives additional load to the 
processor? This will be analyzed in detail in the critical analysis section. 
 
Overall System Level: 
 
On the whole, the power consumption depends on this set of data which involves all the 
individual modules including the previously analyzed modules. Comparing both the 
versions, the hardware has 17705.3 high states on the average and the software has got 
much higher than this which stands to 17934.3. When it comes to the toggle count, the 
hardware has got only 640 counts and the software on the other has got 702.  
 
This information clearly shows that the hardware uses less amount of power to do the 
same operation performed by the software ALUT. When we take the CPU and the overall 
system’s numbers, we find that the software version uses most of the power of the 
processor and ends up drawing more power altogether. We will analyze more into these 
results in the critical analysis section also considering the test cases which use less 
number of entries in the ALUT. 
 
4.6.2. Filling the ALUT as less as possible: 
 
Considering the hardware and software versions of the ALUT, let us summarize the 
values obtained to see which version has consumed more power when the ALUT got 
filled to the minimum.  
 
The following table represents the data for Test 3 and Test 4,

Figure 4.18 Table representing the average High states and the Toggle Count for test 3 and test 4 
 
Analysis of Test 3 and Test 4: 
 
Unlike Test 1 and Test 2, here, we have used only one entry in the look-up table and have 
observed the high states and the toggle counts using the Emulator for both the software 
version and the hardware version. The vales in the above table representing the values 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
52 | P a g e   
 
have been colour coded to represent the ones in green to show that they have taken less 
power and the ones in red to show that they have consumed more power. This observed 
test result shows that the software version is using more power overall when compared 
to the hardware version. 
 
The results obtained for tests 3 and 4 are similar to the results obtained for tests 1 and 2. 
Hence, we will not analyze the results in detail again. This shows that the power 
consumption is independent of the number of entries in the ALUT.  
 
Also, test cases with different number of entries in ALUT behave in a similar way. So, it is 
not required to perform any more test cases with respect to the number of entries in the 
ALUT. 
 
4.7 Performance Analysis: 
 
We have analysed the power consumption of both hardware and the software versions 
of the ALUT. We will look into their performance in this section. 
 
The total time taken for transfer by the hardware = 448,282 ns 
The total time taken for transfer by the software = 584,620 ns 
 
 
 
Figure 4.19 Performance Analyses of Hardware and Software Algorithms

 Software Version 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
53 | P a g e   
 
This data clearly shows that the speed (performance) of the software version is slower 
since it does the same operation in a greater amount of time. The result for the 
performance analysis obtained was similar for the test cases dealing with the fullness of 
the ALUT. It means that in either case the hardware performed better than the software.  
 
Shown in Figure 4.19 is the snapshot of both hardware and the software algorithms. The 
first four data represents the hardware and the last four represents the software version.  
This performance difference between the two versions is due to the fact that the 
hardware ALUT is dedicated to perform only the look-up operation and it does not have 
to perform any other operations. On the other hand the software version is present in 
the memory and it relies on the processor to perform the operation. However, processor 
in the mean time also performs other tasks so it cannot dedicate itself for only 
performing the look-up task.  
 
This performance of the software and hardware can be improved further in certain ways. 
We will look into improving the performance of both the algorithms in the critical 
analysis section. Thus, after the detailed analysis of the waveform we find that the 
hardware algorithm is way faster than the software version.

We have analyzed in detail the results achieved with respect to (i) The workload of the 
look-up table (ii) The power aspect and (iii) The performance aspect in the previous 
chapter, section 4.6 and section 4.7. In this chapter, we will undertake a detailed analysis 
of using the hardware and the software look-up tables. In addition, we will be providing 
suggestions on improving the performance of both hardware and the software look-up 
tables.  
 
5.2 The Software Algorithm: 
 
The software version of the look-up table is coded in C programming language and will be 
loaded along with the firmware. The major advantage of this is that whenever we find a 
new algorithm to implement the look-up table, new software for the look-up table can be 
developed and loaded in the hardware. This can also be done after bug fixing, if we find 
any bugs after the complete development of the system. Loading the software with its 
new version is simple. 
 
When considering the size of the system, the hardware address look-up table consumes a 
lot of space which can be totally avoided by using the software version. This will result in 
the removal of the entire APB subsystem 2 as shown in the system block diagram. This 
will result in a compact version of the system. As the cost of using memory has come 
down, loading the software version of the look-up table will not affect the cost of the 
system. 
 
A key question is raised while asserting that the software algorithm is not going to take 
up additional space in the system since it gets loaded in the memory, that is, how is the 
work done? The software algorithm uses and depends on the system processor to 
perform its operation. The load of processor gets increased since it is loaded with 
additional responsibilities. This will in turn reduce the performance of the processor and 
the overall system. 
 
Cost of production is an important factor when thinking in the system point of view. 
Developing and testing software for the look-up table will definitely bring down the 
overall price of the system. The verification can also be done in an undemanding way for 
software.  When compared to doing the same for hardware algorithm of the address 
look-up table, this time will be fewer. Since verification time and cost goes high for a 
product of superior range, using the software version will definitely bring down the cost.  
 
Having analyzed the pro and cons of the software version of the ALUT in general, let us 
analyze the pros and cons with respect to the results obtained from our test cases.  
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
56 | P a g e   
 
We have analyzed in detail on the results obtained in the section 4.2. This shows that the 
processor has been given more loads. The power consumed by the processor while 
working with the software version of the ALUT is much higher. However, all that matters 
is the overall power consumed by the system. This is also higher when used with the 
software algorithm. Also, our test cases show that the performance of software version is 
also low. 
 
5.3. The Hardware Algorithm: 
 
The hardware version of the look-up table is written in Verilog and its RTL cannot be 
changed after production. This is a drawback when an upgrade is considered. Unlike the 
software version the hardware version cannot be updated frequently. The entire block 
has to be replaced. 
 
When the size of the system is considered, the hardware ALUT will take up additional 
space and it also requires a bridge to communicate through the APB. This bridge is again 
connected to the main AHB to communicate with the other devices. This setup has been 
done in the AHB Subsystem 2 block. This block can be removed when we don’t need the 
hardware version which reduces the size of the system hardware. 
 
The best part of the hardware ALUT version is that it does its operation by itself and does 
not involve the processor. This gives the processer time to do some other important 
operations. This in turn will increase the performance of the overall system. The 
workload of the processor is thus reduced since the ALUT hardware takes care of all the 
activities by itself. 
 
The cost of building the hardware ALUT is more, compared to the software version. This 
also includes the time required additional resources required for its verification. This 
depends on the application that the system will be working on. For critical applications, 
the cost will not be an issue. For other simple applications, the cost does matter and the 
hardware algorithm will definitely shoot up the cost. 
 
Having analyzed the pros and cons of the hardware algorithm in general, let us move on 
to the analysis with respect to the power constraint. The tables and results analysis of 
section 4.2 clearly shows that the hardware consumes more power on certain blocks. 
However, it is also made clear that the hardware algorithm saves a lot of power in the 
CPU and also the power consumed by the overall system is fairly low when compared to 
the software algorithm.  
 
Thus using the hardware ALUT saves power. When we say that the power consumed by 
the processor is low, it means that the work load of the processor is also low. This will 
result in a better performance for the overall system and also save power. This is again 
proved from our test cases.

5.4. How to improve the System: 
 
Having studied the operation of both the hardware and the software versions of the 
address look-up table, it is time for us to provide valuable suggestions on improving the 
efficiency of the system on both power and performance wise. We have encountered the 
power values for various blocks during the data transfer. Are there any ways to improve 
the speed and reduce the power consumption? We will look into the system in these 
aspects in the following sections. 
 
5.4.1. Improving the Hardware version of the ALUT: 
 
In the section 5.3 we encountered a few drawbacks while using the hardware version of 
the ALUT. Considering those points, here we present some valuable suggestions for 
improving the performance of the system while using the hardware ALUT. 
 
The ALUT block can be moved from the APB subsystem 2 to the AHB system which will 
increase the performance of the look-up process. This increase in the performance will 
be due to the improvement in accessing the SRAM. This will not only improve the 
performance but it will also reduce the size and the additional power consumed by the 
APB subsystem.  
 
Upgrading the processor from OR1K to a better commercially available processor will 
give a better performance for the system. Though the impact will be far better for the 
software version, a superior processor will speed up the firmware and thus the overall 
systems performance will be improved. 
 
Another improvement on the hardware algorithm is that it can be given a separate SRAM 
or a Content-Addressable Memory (CAM). This will give a better performance for the 
hardware algorithm due to the fact that the memory accessing time will be reduced 
drastically. 
 
5.4.2. Improving the Software version of the ALUT: 
 
When the system is using the software version of the ALUT, there are power losses in the 
AHB subsystem 2. This power wastage is due to the fact that clocking has been 
happening. This can be avoided by using the clock gating technology as discussed in the 
Background section of chapter 2. This leaves us with a lot of saving in power.  
 
The other major improvement in software version can be done by including a cache 
memory which is several times faster than the SRAM. By decreasing the access time, the 
overall system efficiency can be improved to a greater extend. This not only increases the 
overall efficiency, it also saves a lot of power and paves the way for a low power and a 
faster system. 
 
 Correlating Power Consumption Data from the Hardware and Software Perspective 
58 | P a g e   
 
This system uses the open source OR1K processor which can be upgraded to a more 
efficient low-power embedded processor which may slightly increase the cost. However, 
the system will definitely show a better performance.  
 
The software version can also be improved by using various code optimization 
techniques available for C programming. They should be used to the maximum, to make 
the system faster. Writing the frequently used part of the code in assembly will also 
make the system faster. 
 
5.5 Which version to choose? 
 
As given under the aim of the project, the ultimate plan is to correlate the power 
consumption data from the hardware and the software point of view. With the help of all 
our experiments, we now come to a conclusion that this system without any 
modifications given in section 5.4 is consuming more power when it is used with the 
software version and the performance is also low. We suggest the usage of hardware 
ALUT when power saving and better performance is needed.  
 
This leaves us with the hardware version with one drawback, the size. Possible solutions 
for reducing the size by positioning the block in a different area and thus increasing the 
speed and performance is discussed in the section 5.4.1.

Further Work and Possible Improvements 
 
As mentioned in the previous section, there are several improvements that can be done 
to make our system a faster and a less power consuming system. The suggestions given 
are for both the hardware and the software algorithms.  However we never know which 
algorithm will consume less power after implementing the suggestions. Repeating these 
experiments will definitely reveal those secrets and an ultimate low power system can be 
thus found. 
 
Address look-up tables are widely used these days, from fuel injection systems for 
automobile engines to simple code translation units. All of these embedded systems can 
have either hardware or a software constructed address look-up tables and there can be 
various scenarios in which they will have to be used. This research can be done on those 
systems as well, to give an appropriate or exact figure on which one is power efficient. 
 
This research does not stop with only analyzing the systems with the look-up tables. This 
can be performed on various applications with modules given in hardware and software. 
The manufactures can provide both the algorithms and provide the software engineers a 
data sheet mentioning which version to use depending on the application the software 
engineers intend to develop. This can also be done by giving the software engineers an 
option to dynamically select them during the run time so as to save the power. 
 
This research was jointly done with Cadence Design Systems. They have considered this 
project for further exploration into their research on hardware and software power 
tradeoff.

Conclusion 
 
Before the starting of this project in finding which algorithm is power efficient, I had 
discussed about the possible version which would consume more power. The answers 
and thoughts received were of mixed. However, with all the experiments it became clear 
that it was only the software version which consumes more power. 
 
As a conclusion, considering this SoC, the overall power utilized by the software version 
of the ALUT is higher compared to the hardware version of the ALUT irrespective of the 
number of entries in ALUT. It has also been found that the hardware version not only 
takes less power but it also gives a better performance.  
 
Valuable suggestions have been given on improving both the versions along with the 
explanation for their present performance. There are many unexplored systems on which 
this investigation can be done so as to find the possible ways to save power in this power 
thirsty world.
