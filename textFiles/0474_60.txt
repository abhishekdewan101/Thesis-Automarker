Abstract 
 
This project presents an application for image matching between different views and 
scales of an object within an image. A new robust method is proposed collaborating SIFT 
[1], Cross Correlation Matching [25] and RANSAC [9] algorithms, to obtain a problem 
solution. These algorithms are replicated and optimised in terms of performance and 
efficiency, and critically analysed in the following chapters. The proposed method allows 
concurrent decision if one or several objects are common to the two images, extracting 
distinctive invariant features from the images and estimating the corresponding matching 
rate. The features are invariant to image scaling and rotation and may be affected by 
distortion, noise and different illumination. The features are highly distinctive and can be 
correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features.  
 
This project also describes the use of the proposed method as a way of simplifying the RS 
company component ordering procedure. The RS Electronics Company sells a variety of 
electronic components, where component orders are placed using the partsÕ serial 
numbers. The major setback is that most of the times the component serial number cannot 
be retrieved.  
 
By using the project application, the client will be able to place an order by sending a 
photo of the component.  The client is required to take some photos of the component and 
upload them in the company online system that uses the proposed application. The 
company system then processes the image, attempts to match it with one or more images 
from the componentsÕ database. At the end the application provides to the client a 
detailed feedback report informing whether the component was found.  
 
Experimental results on real images verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in 
respect of accuracy and speed, on images with various characteristics.

1. Introduction 
 
The digital image processing field is in great demand in the industry and the research 
area. During the end of the last century, mankind started to make its first steps into the 
digital image world [33]. Within a short period of time, humans abandoned film based 
cameras and started using digital ones, which are more compact, easy to use and which 
offer better resolution compared to the price. Ever since technology switched to digital 
cameras, an investment boost has occurred in the field of research and development of 
digital image processing. Image processing was employed by photographers and related 
jobs some time before the advent of the digital camera, as a tool to edit photos and 
images. With the use of a digital camera, it became easier to get an image without the 
interaction of professional and digital image processing software. Hence, it could be used 
by everyone, without requiring any professional knowledge. Very soon, digital image 
processing became a very popular subject and today is being taught in schools and 
universities. Image processing can moreover be used at an advanced level; to extract 
image information and details or in the context of different applications which could not 
be implemented with a different approach.  
 
A representative example is an autonomous surveillance system, which was previously 
based on sensors to scan the environment but which now uses cameras and image 
processing as the main tool for recognition. Thus, advanced algorithms are designed to 
serve image processing applications. Image processing algorithms are now embedded in 
hardware to improve the performance of the digital image process, such as that of a 
Smartphone or a digital camera which utilise a face recognition algorithm to identify and 
focus on a human face at the moment of trying to capture an image. In a surveillance 
system, an edge detection algorithm may be used to recognise whether a human has 
crossed into the protected area. Such application may appear to be a simple one which 
performs an easy and simple task. Nevertheless, advanced algorithms using high level 
mathematical calculations are being implemented and run behind this application. 
Furthermore, a combination of these algorithms is widely applied to enhance the 
performance and the broad application abilities. 
 
Object matching in digital image processing is a very complex problem with a variety of 
uses despite the fact that it may look simple at first sight. The idea behind the object 
matching concept is to create a system algorithm to identify whether two images have 
similarities as well as the degree of such similarity. Imagine two different images of the 
same object, where each image is captured from a different distance and different 
perspective. The result theoretically should be positive, since the same object exists in 
both images. There are several obstacles that may affect the result, such as image noise 
and distortion which will affect images individually. Another issue in object matching 
problem solutions is the algorithm performance related to speed, correctness and 
accuracy of the result, especially in real time scenarios. 
  
Over the course of the last two decades, some algorithms and techniques have been 
proposed in order to detect whether two or more images are similar. These algorithms 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 8
and techniques are a fundamental and essential part of the object matching problem, but 
still they are not the solution to the problem.  
 
The object matching problem is analysed through a series of steps in order to achieve an 
accurate match between two images. The first and most essential step in this process 
cycle is the imagesÕ features recognition and storage. The purpose of this kind of 
technique is to extract distinctive image features from both images and to save them in a 
database of features. SIFT and Harris corner detection constitutes examples of these 
algorithms. The next step is to match the extracted features between the two images, and 
define the putative matches. This step can be implemented by means of a matching 
technique like the Correlation window method. The last step as well as the most essential 
of an object matching procedure, is the estimation of the accurate matches and the 
calculation of the matching rate. The correct matchesÕ estimation can be achieved by 
applying a sampling algorithm. This type of algorithm is using a mathematical model 
based on Epipolar geometry or/and Euclidean distance for the calculation of image 
inliers. A successful algorithm in this field is RANSAC algorithm. 
 
An effective solution to the object matching problem can be produced by incorporating 
all the introduced algorithms.  These will be analysed individually in the following 
chapters. 
 
1.1 Aim & Objectives 
 
This section describes in detail the aims and the objectives of the project and analyses the 
structure of this document. 
1.1.1 Aim 
 
The primary aim of this project is to design and develop an application that will be able 
to decide whether two or more images match, calculate matching ratio and determine 
their common object. The proposed application must be capable of handling images with 
poor illumination, different scale and rotation and to verify the effectiveness using the RS 
company electrical components.  
1.1.2 Algorithm Objectives 
 
This project has two main objectives. Defining the collaboration between the three 
algorithms, SIFT, Window Correlation matching and RANSAC algorithms. The selection 
process of these algorithms can be found in the interim report, in which a comparison 
between them is included. This collaboration involves the declaration of an execution 
cycle for each algorithm and the type and number of parameters that will be interchanged 
within the application, based on the theoretical background of each algorithm. 
 
The second objective and the most complicated one, is to replicate and optimise these 
algorithms in order to solve any problem and error that may occur during the program 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 9
implementation. Algorithms implementation will be executed in MATLAB programming 
language. MATLAB is a high level programming language which provides development 
tools which facilitate the rapid development and handling of images. Algorithms 
optimisation with respect to the matching accuracy and speed are also included. 
 
1.2 Report Structure 
 
This report consists of five main sections. Firstly (Chapter 2), the theoretical background 
is described in detail. An introduction to digital image matching is described using 
previous experiments. In addition the requirements of object matching software are 
explained. Each algorithm structure is scrutinised with respect to the mathematical 
background, explained in each of the processing steps independently. Also, in this section 
some results from previous implementations are presented.       
 
In the basic framework and implementation section (Chapter 3), the developed 
application is explained.  Each algorithm and function implementation step is analysed 
using diagrams, flowcharts and figures in accordance with the project requirements. 
 
In the next section (Chapter 4), application tests and results are presented and examined 
in terms of matching accuracy and speed. Project application will be tested under some 
basic and thorough tests. At the end of this section, graphs will be used to verify the 
matching rate results.  
 
Through the fourth section (Chapter 5), project conclusions will be discussed in relation 
to the results obtained. In addition, a project evaluation will critically assess the projectÕs 
achievements and determine whether it has met and achieved its objectives. Finally, in 
the last section (Chapter 6), future improvements and work are proposed.  
 
The code of each of the main functions can be found in Appendix section 9.

2. Theoretical Background 
 
This chapter is a review of the work undertaken in object matching applications. To this 
effect, the three main algorithms which are utilised in this project are introduced and 
analysed on the basis of their theoretical and mathematical background.  
 
2.1 A Review of Previous Work in Object Matching 
 
There are several studies related to the digital image matching field. Important research 
studies have been carried out during the last five years. Project algorithms, SIFT, 
Correlation Window matching and RANSAC were previously used, in conjunction with 
other significant algorithms for object matching processing. The main purpose of an 
image object matching software is to determine the matching ratio and whether the 
images match in comparison. With this type of software, it is essential to ascertain the 
correct common points between the images accurately and not a relation between their 
points. Previous influential works are briefly described below.      
  
? Harris corner, window correlation and RANSAC paradigms were implemented 
together for object matching operations. Harris corner algorithm was used in 
relation to corner points (keypoints) detection. Furthermore, window correlation 
and RANSAC algorithms were employed in order to identify putative matches 
and inliers (valid points) respectively. Results demonstrated weaknesses in 
matching two images when there is a large change in the imagesÕ viewpoint. Also, 
confusion occurred in repetitive textures and some image pairs were computed 
incorrectly. A satisfactory result was produced, which was not however sufficient 
when a detailed object matching was required [17]. 
? SIFT and RANSAC algorithms were also previously used for object matching. 
This approach was more robust than the previous one and was considered as a 
good approach where speed is a requirement. However, there is potential for 
improvements [17].  
? An enhanced implementation of RANSAC, coded as MAC-RANSAC, 
outperforms RANSAC avoiding some of its main limitations and drawbacks, with 
the exception of the maximal number of iterations which is fixed considering time 
complexity [16]. 
? Finally, the a contrario model surpasses some of the best matching methods such 
as M-estimators, LmedS and classical RANSAC by estimating the relative points 
between two images, even if there is a large number of outliers up to 90% [15]. 
 
All of these recent implementations show that there is potential for improvements and 
optimizations that can be performed to achieve better results with respect to accuracy and 
application efficiency. Some of the referred modelsÕ results are presented below, see 
figures 1(a-d).

2.2 SIFT Feature based Object Recognition 
 
The SIFT algorithm, proposed by David Lowe in 1999, is an image processing algorithm 
which can be used to identify and extract the distinct features of an image. Once these 
features have been detected from the two reference images, they can be stored in the 
database of features, which may be a different file. The SIFT algorithm output is a set of 
keypoint descriptors and not the result of a two-image comparison. As long as the 
descriptors have been generated and stored, the image matching procedure can begin 
image matching. For image matching the nearest neighbour algorithm can be used [1, 2]. 
The SIFT algorithm processing cycle can be observed in figure 1.

Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 12
2.2.1 SIFT Algorithm Types of Invariance 
 
The SIFT algorithm should be effective and to operate accurately within all sorts of 
image irregularities that may occur between images. The SIFT algorithm should be 
invariant to image [6, 7]: 
 
? Illumination 
? Image noise 
? Scaling 
? Rotation  
? Changes in viewpoint  
 
2.2.2 SIFT Algorithm Computational Phases 
  
The SIFT algorithm consists of four phases. These phases simplify the operation whilst 
facilitating understanding regarding the SIFT processing cycle [1, 2]. The four phases 
are: 
 
1. Scale-space Extrema Detection 
2. Keypoint Localisation 
3. Orientation Assignment 
4. Keypoint Descriptor 
 
2.2.2.1 Phase 1: Scale-space Extrema Detection 
 
The first computation phase identifies effective interest points. It runs through all scales 
and image locations and seeks out for identical potential points. The computation is 
achieved efficiently by using the Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) function. The resulting 
potential interest points of the computation are invariant to image scale rotation and 
orientation [1, 2]. 
 
Image scale space is defined as the function ? ??,, yxL  which is produced from the 
convolution of a variable-scale Gaussian, ? ??,, yxG and an input image,  [1,7]: ? yxI , ?
 
?
  ? ? ? ? ? ?yxIyxGyxL ,,,,, ?? ?? (1) 
 
,where * represents the convolution operation for x, y and ? the feature point scale, thus: 
 
? ? ? ?e yxyxG 222 2/22
1,, ????
??? (2) 
 
For the efficient detection of stable keypoint locations in scale space, DoG function 
convolved with the image, ? ?,, yxD  is used and is computed from the difference of [1]: 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 13
  
? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ?y  (3) xIyxGkyxGyxD ,,,,,,, ? ? ? ? ? ?
 
,where k is a constant multiplicative factor. 
 
By employing the above equation it is given that:  
? ? ? ? ? ? (4) ?
 
,which is simply the difference between Gaussian blurred images L, at scales ? and k? 
[7]. 
 
The first step for potential interest points detection is the repeated image convolution 
with Gaussian filters at different scales, and the generation of a set of scale space images, 
see figure 3 (left side) [7].  Then the subtraction of adjacent Gaussian images (is applied 
to produce the DoG images (right side). At the time that an each octave has been 
computed, the processing cycle is over and the Gaussian image is down-sampled by a 
factor of two (2). Subsequently the processing cycle is repeated again [1].The resulting 
convolved images are grouped together by an octave (where an octave corresponds to the 
parameter ? by double). The value of k parameter is selected and as a result of which a 
fixed number of blurred and DoG images are obtained [1, 7]. 
It is important to mention an approximation to the scale-normalised Laplacian of 
Gaussian , which is provided by DoG filter.  G22??

?? ,,,,,, yxLkyxLyxD ? ?
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 14
The next step within the first phase is the detection of local maxima and minima of the 
image (keypoints), ? ??,, yxD , where each sampled point is compared against its nine (9) 
neighbours in the same image and the 18 neighbours in the scale above and below (nine 
(9) neighbours in each scale), see figure 4. Provided that the pixel is a local maximum or 
minimum, then it is defined as a candidate keypoint, and is selected only if it is larger or 
smaller than all of its 26 neighbours together [1, 7]. 
 
 
Figure 4: Local maxima and minima detection of the DoG images. Comparing ÒXÓ pixel to its 26 
neighbours [1].   
2.2.2.2 Phase 2: Keypoint Localisation 
 
The second phase of the SIFT algorithm uses all interest potential points that are found in 
the first phase, and creates a detailed model for location and scale determination. Stability 
is the keypoint in the selection criterion. Each stable keypoint is a keypoint that is 
resistant to image distortion [2]. Unstable points are rejected, since it means that they 
have low contrast and therefore are sensitive to image noise. 
 
Initially, this approach locates keypoints relative to central sample point scale and 
location. To determine the interpolation of the maximum, a three dimensional (3D) 
quadratic function is fitted to the local sample points. This provides effectively improves 
stability matching. 
 
The scale-space function ? ??,, yxD  is shifted, and thus the origin is at the sample point

,where  is the location of the extremum and if the offset  is greater than 0.5 in any 
dimension, this means that the extremum comes closer to a different point.

In this case, the sample point will change and the interpolation will be performed. In 
order to obtain the interpolation estimation for the extremum location, the final offset  
and the sample point are added.

The return value of extremum function ? ?xD ö  proves useful in order to reject unstable 
extrema with low contrast. This function can be obtained by substituting the two previous 
equations and thus giving:

In figures 5a-5d, the effect of keypoint selection on a natural image can be observed. 
These examples are experiments obtained by [1] paper, in relation to all of which extrema 
with value of ? ?xD ö  less than 0.03 were rejected, see figures 5(a-c). The four examples 
provided below are helpful to understand how the keypoint selection is performed, and 
how this selection process can be improved.  
 
A 233x189 pixel image is used. A low resolution image was selected in order to avoid 
increased cluster amount. Keypoints are present in the image as vectors determine the 
location, scale (arrow length) and orientation (arrow orientation) for each keypoint.

contrast.

maxima and minima of DoG function.

 Figure 5(c): Keypoints reduced to 729, 
due to ? ?xD ö =0.03 factor.  Figure 5(d): Factor r=10. Keypoints with ratio greater than 10 are eliminated. 
 
Eliminating edge responses serve to increase stability performance. Rejecting low 
contrast keypoints is not enough. The DoG function has a strong response along the 
edges; therefore unstable keypoints which are susceptible to small amounts of noise are 
detected. For each poor edge found in DoG function, a principal curvature will appear 
across the edge but also a small one in the perpendicular direction. By using a 2x2 
Hessian matrix, the principal curvatures can be computed at keypoint location and scale 
[1]: 
 
 
??

H  
(8) 
,where H is a Hessian matrix. 
 
By taking the differences of neighbouring sample points, the derivatives can be 
computed. H matrix eigenvalues are proportional to the principal curvatures of D. Since 
we are concerned only with the eigenvalues ratio, their computation can be avoided. The 
next step is the computation of the eigenvaluesÕ sum from the trace of H matrix as well as 
their product from the determinant [1]: 
 
 ? ? ?? ???? yyxx DDHTr , (9) 
 ? ? ????? 2)(DxyDDHDet yyxx  (10) 
 where ? is the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude and ? with the smallest one. 
 
In the computation of the determinant there is a possibility for the result to be negative, 
thus the point is discarded since it is not considered as extremum given that the 
curvatures have different signs. Let r be the ratio between the smaller and the largest 
eigenvalues, thus, ?? r?  , which results in the equation shown below [1]:

Observing the above simplification we can take notice of the fact that the new point 
depends only on the eigenvaluesÕ ratio rather than on their individual values. The (r+1)2/r 
obtains its minimum value when the two eigenvalues are equal and it increases with r. 
Therefore, if we want to perform a check whether the ratio of the principal curvatures is 
below a defined threshold r, we only need to check whether the following equation is 
satisfied [1]:  
 
 ? ?

This can be computed efficiently, when operations with less than 20 floating point are 
required. In the example provided, the r value is set to ten (10), which means that the 
keypoints with ratio greater than ten (10) between the principal curvatures are rejected. 
The effect of this operation can be observed in figure 5d [1].    
2.2.2.3 Phase 3: Orientation Assignment 
 
In the third phase, [2] SIFT computes the gradient of the keypoints identified in the 
second phase. For each keypoint, one or more orientations are assigned on the basis of 
local image gradient directions. Features operations that may be performed in image data 
will be transformed relative to each featureÕs assigned orientation, scale and location, 
thus providing invariance in these transformations [1].   
 
 
For each candidate keypoint the following rules are applied [7]: 
 
? Keypoint position is determined by the interpolation of its closed data. 
? Low contrast keypoints are rejected. 
? Determined keypoint orientation. 
? Responses along edges are rejected.  
 
The Gaussian blurred image L with the closest scale is selected comparatively to the 
keypoint scale. To this effect, all computations are performed in a scale-invariant manner. 
Subsequently, for each image sample, L(x,y), on that scale, the gradient magnitude m(x,y) 
and the orientation ? (x,y) is pre-computed using pixel differences[1]:

Keypoint orientation is determined by computing the gradient orientation histogram of 
the keypoint neighbourhood.  This is computed using the Gauissian image at the scale 
which is closest to the keypointÕs scale. Each neighbouring pixel is weighted by the 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 18
gradient magnitude and by a Gaussian at a scale of 1.5 times of the keypoint (? =1.5 
times). 
 
Dominant orientations are defined by observing the computed histogram peaks. A new 
identical keypoint is generated for the corresponding direction to the histogram maximum 
and for any direction which is greater than 80% of the maximum value. All of the 
keypoint properties are computed comparatively to the keypoint orientation. This feature 
provides invariance to rotation [7, 1].  
2.2.2.4 Phase 4: Keypoint Descriptor 
 
The previous SIFT phases are assigned to each selected keypoint information, such as 
image location, scale and orientation. A two dimensional (2D) coordinate system is used 
to represent the local image region which must have invariance to these parameters [1]. 
 
The final phase computes a descriptor for each local image sample point in a region 
around the keypoint location [2, 1]. The keypointsÕ descriptors are highly distinctive but 
should be as invariant as possible to the remaining variations, such as changes in three 
dimensional (3D) viewpoint plan and illumination [1].  
 
For each keypoint, the magnitude of local image gradients together with orientation are 
measured at the selected scale in that region, see figure 6 (left side), and these keypoints 
are converted into a representation which allows for sensible levels of local shape change 
in illumination and distortion.  
 
A weight is applied to each of the samples. This weight has been assigned by a Gaussian 
window with ? =1.5 times the width of the descriptor window, defined by the overlaid 
circle (left side). The Gaussian window method is applied to avoid any sudden descriptor 
changes [1, 7]. 
 
The weighted samples are accumulated into orientation histograms with the objective of 
summarising their contents into 4x4 sub-regions (right side). Figure 6 shows six (6) 
directions whereby the length of each arrow represents the sum of the gradient 
magnitudes near that direction within the specified region. An 8x8 set of samples is used 
to compute a 2x2 descriptor array. 
 
Changes to image contrast will be cancelled by vector normalization, since both image 
pixel values and gradient will be multiplied by the same constant. Variations in 
brightness may also occur, but which result to no changes given that a constant value 
(due to brightness) is added in relation to all image pixels. The reason behind this is 
because gradient values are not affected in view of the fact that they are computed by 
pixel differences resulting in a descriptor, which is invariant to affine changes in 
illumination [1].

2.2.3 SIFT & Image Matching 
 
The SIFT algorithm output is a set of distinctive keypoint descriptors and not the result of 
a two-image comparison. Once the keypoint descriptors set has generated from each 
image, the image matching processing can begin. Image matching processing can be 
performed by using a Matching Algorithm, see figure 2. Various implementations can be 
employed to carry out image matching, each one with different characteristics [2]. 
 
As mentioned in the previous sub-section, keypoint descriptors are highly distinctive. A 
descriptor feature can be matched with a feature within the features database, whereby 
there is good probability for such matching. Nevertheless, in the case of a cluttered 
image, many background features will not match correctly. Therefore, many false 
matches will be predicted in addition to the correct ones. By identifying keypoint subsets 
that match object parameters (location, scale and orientation), accurate matches can be 
filtered from the full set of matches. The probability that an individual feature match will 
be an erroneous one is higher than the probability that a series of features will match 
these parameters.  
 
A solution to this problem can be achieved with the use of an efficient keypoints distance 
estimation algorithm, with the use of which it is decided whether a dataset is matched 
based on a mathematical model for the determination of these accurate clusters. Such 
algorithm is the RANSAC which will be described in detail in the next section.

algorithm and the output is a set of matched similar keypoint descriptors. 
 
2.3 Cross - correlation Window Matching 
2.3.1 Correlation Method 
 
The Correlation is a statistical method that is utilised for the comparison of two variables. 
It consists of a quantitative measurement of data within a data set. Correlation method 
measures the relation between two variables (X and Y) and quantitates the strength of this 
relation. The strength is determined by the linear relationship between the X and Y 
variables. This relationship is represented by the number of points that are found to be 
fixed within a straight line [20].  
 
The result of the correlation between X and Y variables is the Pearson product-moment 
correlation coefficient, which has been originally proposed by Francis Galton in 1886 and 
subsequently formalized by Karl Pearson in 1896 [19]. Pearson correlation coefficient 
quantifies the relationship between the X and Y variables which is denoted with the letter 
r.  When all the points within a scatter plot line have an upward incline, r is equal to plus 
one (+1). On the other hand, when the line has downward direction, r is equal to minus 
one (-1). The r values which are closer to plus one (+1) and minus one (-1) indicate a 
strong correlation. When the outcome is equal to plus one (+1) it means that the images 
are identical. In contrast, the minus one (-1) indicate same image but flipped around.  The 
values which are closer to zero (0) denote a weak correlation between X and Y variables 
whilst a zero (0) value indicates that the two variables have nothing in common [19, 20]. 
Examples of correlation can be observed in scatter plot graphs in figures 8(a-d).  
 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 21
  
Figure 8(a): Perfect Positive Correlation r = 1 Figure 8(b): Strong Positive Correlation, r >= 0.8 
  
Figure 8(c): Weak Negative Correlation, r<=-0.5 Figure 8(d): Zero Correlation, r=0 
 
2.3.2 PearsonÕs Correlation Coefficient 
 
As mentioned in the previous section, the result of the correlation is the correlation 
coefficient r, which takes values between plus one (+1) and minus one (-1). This value 
reflects the amount of commonality found between the two variables [19]. 
  
To calculate the correlation coefficient, the sum of squares (??) for each variable X and 
Y plus the sum of the cross products of X and Y is required [19, 22]. 
 
The sum of squares for X variables is: 
 
 
 
(15) ? ???? 2)( XXiXX
 
The sum of squares for Y variables is:

By using the above equations, correlation coefficient r can be calculated as shown below

2.3.3 Cross correlation  
 
Cross correlation is an image matching technique, which employs basic correlation 
approach in order to match different portions of images against one another. Cross 
correlation is applicable for the purposes of image processing because it uses a pixel-by-
pixel comparison for an area of interest within the image under analysis. The result of 
cross correlation is an image with a set of spots, where each spot shows the position of 
that image which matches to the reference image. Each spot is described by a grayscale 
value, where the brighter spot represents a better match. To eliminate false matches, a 
threshold value can be set to determine whether a spot represents an inlier or an outlier. 
Values below that threshold will be discarded [24]. The image area under interest, can be 
represented as a square window (i.e. 5x5 pixels for a 250x300 image), which it is 
compared with the pixels in the reference image. 
 
Cross correlation operation is similar to the operation relating to the spatial convolution 
one, where two functions are combined to form a third one [27]. In cross correlation, the 
image mask, which is the correlation window, is moved pixel-by-pixel to the input image 
and a third image is used for placing the result [24]. This process is illustrated in figure 9.  
 
 
 
 
 Figure 9: Cross correlation matching process for the input pixel I(x,y), creating the output pixel O(x,y). 
 
The results of the cross correlation, when applied to two dimensional (2D) images, 
represent an array of points called the correlation map. The correlation map defines the 
common points between the two images. Where there is no correlation between the two 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 23
images, the output values will be relatively small. These values can be significantly large 
where the brightest values tend to be equal. The basic function of cross correlation for 
template matching is influenced by the square Euclidean distance measure and is defined 
as follows [24, 26]:

The aforementioned technique faces a significant limitation. On the occasions where the 
image  activity varies according to the position, then the use of the above 
equation is not suggested [26]. Despite this drawback, it can be employed successfully 
when the input image will potentially match exactly or when it is close to the feature 
point [24].   
? ),( yxI
 
The above limitation aside, the correlation coefficient technique (18) overcomes these 
problems since the image and feature vectors are normalised to unit length. Although the 
correlation coefficient technique provides a solution in relation to the cross correlation 
problems, there is no feedback as to how accurately it corresponds when a large rotation 
is applied between the two images.

2.4 RANSAC Keypoints Estimation Algorithm 
 
The RANSAC algorithm was proposed by Fischler and Bolles in 1981. RANSAC is a 
very successful and robust estimator algorithm which gives a solution to image matching 
problems [10]. It was introduced initially as a method or technique to estimate the 
parameters of an input model, and designed in such way to cope with a large number of 
outliers in the input data [11, 12]. 
 
The RANSAC algorithm relies on a re-sampling technique which can generate entrant 
solutions.  This is achieved by using the minimum number of observations required for 
the input model parameters determination. The RANSAC algorithm starts by bringing 
into play the smallest possible set and through its operation the set is enlarged with 
consistent data points [12].   
  
2.4.1 RANSAC Basic Operation 
 
RANSAC algorithm processing is simple and effective. Initially, two points (keypoints) 
that define a line are selected randomly. The ÒcorrectnessÓ of this line depends on the 
number of image points that occur within a distance threshold t. This random selection is 
repeated for n number of times and the line with the most accurate results is considered as 
being the most robust one. The points inside the specified threshold distance are the 
inliers (Consensus Set). In a case when at least one line point is considered to constitute 
an outliner, the lineÕs ÒcorrectnessÓ will be controverted, see figures 7a-7e. If more than 
one line is found which is considered as being ÒcorrectÓ (only accurate points exist and 
no outliers), then the line with the most ÒcorrectnessÓ will be selected. If line A has a 
ÒcorrectnessÓ equal to nine (9) and a line B has a ÒcorrectnessÓ equal to six (6), then line 
A will be selected. This example is refers to a one dimensional (1D) transformation, thus, 
two points are enough to determine the model [10]. 
 
In image processing, the problem solution is more complicated since the model estimates 
a planar homography. The minimal subset of a set of two dimensional (2D) point 
correspondences consists of four correspondences, given that now each point in an image 
is represented in X, Y coordinates. Consider an image as a graph where points A and B 
are represented by (x, y) and (z, e), respectively [10]. See figures 10 (a-e) [18].

ÒcorrectnessÓ is found. 
 
 
2.4.2 RANSAC Computational Phases 
 
The RANSAC algorithm is composed of two indispensable phases that are repeated until 
the predefined problem requierments have been satisfied. These two steps are mentioned 
below and will be analysed individually in the following sub-sections [11]. 
   
1. Hypothesize 
2. Consistency Test 
 
RANSAC does not stop neither at the end of the second phase nor on a predefined 
number of iterations. It terminates when the probability of finding a better ranked 
Consensus Set falls below the predefined threshold value.   
 
2.4.2.1 Phase 1: Hypothesise 
 
The first phase of RANSACÕs operation involves the random selection of the Minimal 
Sample Sets (MMSs) from the input data set. It is important to mention that image 
extracted features compromise the input data set, where the RANSAC algorithm is not 
involved in this operation. Since MMSs are randomly selected, MMSs elements are used 
to compute model parameters. MMSs cardinality is small enough to specify the model 
parameters [10, 11]. 
 
2.4.2.2 Phase 2: Consistency Test 
 
In the second phase of the algorithm, the entire dataset elements are examined for their 
consistency relative to the model, which was initialised with the computed parameters of 
the first phase [10, 11]. 
 
 
 
 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 26
2.4.3 RANSAC Algorithm Processing Cycle 
 
The RANSAC algorithm process cycle can be split into five steps. These five steps 
facilitate towards the algorithmÕ comprehension and simplify the implementation process 
by breaking it up into smaller and easier to design procedures.  
 
2.4.3.1 RANSAC Five Process Steps & Parameters Computation 
 
To facilitate the subsequent discussion, it is useful and convenient to introduce a suitable 
and common representation of the following five steps. S represents the input data set, s 
is the number of data points, T the threshold, t is model threshold and N the number of 
trials. 
 
The five algorithm process steps are [10, 12] listed below and a Data Flowchart Diagram 
(DFD) of the algorithm can be observed in figure 8. 
 
(1) Select randomly a number s of data points (distinct keypoints) from S and then 
instantiate the model from this subset. 
(2) Determine the data points, inliers Si (CS), from S data set. Inliers should be within 
the distance threshold t. 
(3) If the inliers Si number fraction is greater than a defined threshold T, re-estimate the 
model parameters using the corresponding inliers and afterwards terminate.  
(4) On the occasion that , select a new subset and repeat steps 1 to 3. TSi ?
 
(5) After N number of trials, the Si (CS), with the best ranking is selected. Then, the 
model is re-estimated using the corresponding inliers in the Si subset and the process 
is terminated. 
 
The RANSAC algorithm has three undefined parameters; each of them has a different 
computation mechanism that leads to its identification. The unspecified parameters are 
mentioned and explored below [9]: 
 
? Error tolerance, defined as e.  
? The number of attempt subsets, N. 
? Distance threshold, t. 
 
It is computationally unnecessary and inefficient to check every possible sample. Thus, 
the number of iterations N is chosen to be large enough, with a probability p, that at least 
one of the random data points s, is free from outliers. Probability p is usually set to 0.99, 
so as to minimise the probability where there is no consistency. Let w be the probability 
where any selected data point is an inlier, and e the probability that it is an outlier. 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 27
Therefore, . By using this and assuming that N is the number of iterations 
required for a sample of s data points it means that [9, 10]:

In light of the rule of thumb, the algorithm processing is terminated when the size of the 
consensus set is similar to the number of inliers that are considered within the data set, 
taking into account the assumed outliers ratio. For n number of data points, 
[10].The distance threshold value t, is employed to determine whether a 
sample data (datum) fits into a model and it represents the number of compatible data 
points used to denote that the correct model has been found. The reason why threshold t 
value must be large enough, is that it has to satisfy two purposes. The first purpose is to 
ensure that the correct model for the data was identified. The second one is to satisfy the 
needs of the final smoothing procedure by ensuring that a sufficient number of common 
consistent points have been located [9]. In practice, the threshold value is chosen 
empirically. However, if we assume that ? is the probability when a sample data is an 
inlier, and presuming that the error tolerance is Gaussian with a mean equal to zero (0) 
and standard deviation ?, and then a value for threshold t can be computed. In such a 
case, , which is the square of the point distance, is a sum of Gaussian variables 
which follows distribution, where m represent degrees of freedom and is equal to the co-
dimension of the exact model. Since the model is a point, the co-dimension is equal to 
two (2) and the is the sum of squared x, y measurement errors. From the cumulative 
distribution it is given that [10]:

 2.4.4 RANSAC Errors Solution Mechanism 
 
During RANSAC algorithm operation some errors may occur. These errors derive from 
local feature detectors and can be separated in two types as follows [9]: 
 
1. Classification Errors: This type of error occurs when a keypoint of an image is 
incorrectly identified as a constitution of a feature. Classification errors are gross 
errors and have a significant impact and cannot average out. For this reason, the 
best solution is to select a reliable local feature detector that will collaborate with 
RANSAC.   
 
2. Measurement Errors: This type of error occurs when a feature of an image is 
correctly identified, but one of its parameters is a slightly miscalculated. Usually 
measurement errors follow a normal distribution and therefore the smoothing 
assumption is still applicable to them. 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 29
3. Basic Framework & Implementation 
 
As mentioned in the previous section, the proposed application was implemented in 
MATLAB R2010a. This section analyses and explores the implementation of each 
algorithm including any problems that have been overcome. A reference to the 
application structure and how the results are calculated is also included, as well as any 
other methods tried and tested during the implementation step.   
3.1 Application Operation Structure 
 
The three algorithms which are used have already been introduced in the previous 
sections. The proposed method must employ rotation and scale invariance, extraction and 
detection of distinctive features from images, without any problems. Application 
operation structure is illustrated in figure 12 and described below: 
 
1. When application starts: Two images are used as the software input. The first 
image is the image that a client sends to the companyÕs online system and it 
could be an image with low illumination and contras. The second one is an image 
taken from the company database, which is a ÒperfectÓ image with sufficient 
illumination and high contrast. The ÒperfectÓ terminology will be explained in 
the SIFT section. For convenience purposes and lack of time, a vector of images 
is utilized instead of creating a connection to an SQL database. Both images are 
converted to grayscale and the image size is reduced if the image is large. This 
reduction is set by a threshold value, which is under programmer choice. During 
application testing, the size of both images is approximately reduced to 500x300, 
depending on image orientation. Both image transformations are used for saving 
processing overheat. A blur filter is applied in the image for image smoothing, 
and image contrast is enhanced by subtracting the smooth image by the image 
minimum value. Then is divided by the image maximum value see figures 13(a-
c) for images transformation and figures 14a-14c for a representation of the 
imagesÕ histograms. 
 
2. SIFT distinctive feature recognition: Once the imagesÕ transformation is 
completed, SIFT operation is ready to begin. The SIFT algorithm is implemented 
as a separate function, where its input consists of the two images and a set of 
parameters. The result is a vector (database) of distinctive features and a vector 
of descriptors for each extracted image feature. There is no relation between the 
two vectors and each one can have different size. As soon as SIFT operation is 
completed, the two images are printed including the extracted features of each 
image. 
 
3. Match by Correlation: With the end of SIFT operation, each image features 
vector is used as the input for the match by the correlation function. This function 
is responsible for the determination of putative matches. The putative matches 
can be considered as the theoretical matches; this means that with calculated 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 30
 
4. RANSAC estimation: The last part of the software is split in two parts.  
 
a. The first part involves the estimation of the correct matches with the use 
of the RANSAC mathematical model, which is responsible for estimating 
and deciding whether a point is correct or not, based on points distance. 
The RANSAC algorithm is implemented in a different function and its 
input is a vector, including the inliers between the two images. Once this 
estimation is completed, a new figure is printed, including the two images 
common points. 
 
b. The second part deals with the calculation of the matching rate between 
the two images. Matching rate is obtained in percentage value, and it is 
necessary for the user to identify whether two images have a common 
object or not. More details about matching rate calculation and how 
software decide if two images have common objects will be explained 
later, at the end of this chapter.

3.2 SIFT Feature based Object Recognition [34] 
 
This section describes the SIFT algorithm implementation. As aforementioned for the 
algorithmsÕ design MATLAB R2010a was employed. The SIFT algorithm is 
implemented as a separate function and is designed to provide flexibility to the 
applicationÕs user. This flexibility is achieved by offering a wide list of input parameters, 
which can be set by the user, according to his preference. The default values are 
equivalent with those chosen by D.G. Lowe. Thus, results which are similar to D.G. 
LoweÕs SIFT version are obtained [1]. 
 
The SIFT algorithm it is consist of two main instances, these being the SIFT detector and 
descriptor. 
 
? The SIFT featureÕs detector is used to extract image frames and keypoints. These 
frames and keypoints are oriented points attached to the images in a blob-alike 
form. The frame tracks these blobs, while the image rotates, translates and scales, 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 33
 
? The SIFT descriptor is a common image edge description that can be found within 
a frame. Moreover, the generated image descriptors are invariant to image 
rotation, translation and scaling and can also be robust when there are small image 
distortions. 
 
The complete processing operation of SIFT function is illustrated in the data flow chart 
(DFD) diagram shown in figure 15.

3.2.1 SIFT Function Input Parameters and Return Values  
 
Input Parameters: 
 
As mentioned above, the SIFT function provides a long list of input parameters. This list 
is informally separated in three categories. The parameters that describe the Gaussian 
Scale Space, the SIFT detector and the SIFT descriptor are listed as follows: 
 
1. Gaussian scale space parameters:  
 
a. The number of octaves O. The default value is thus set to cover all 
possible feature sizes. 
 
b. The first octave index, mino . The default value is set to minus one (-1), as 
in D.G. LoweÕs implementation. By setting the default value to minus one 
(-1), the image pixel values before the Gss are doubled. 
 
c. The number of sub-levels S of each octave. D. G. LoweÕs implementation 
uses S=3.  
 
d. The base smoothing ?0, which is the first octave zero (0) level smoothing. 
D. G. LoweÕs implementation employs  21.6?  1/S .  0 ??
   
e. The nominal smoothing level ?n, for the input image. 
 
2. Detector parameters: 
 
a. DoG scale space maxima threshold t. Values below that threshold are 
ignored and smaller values accept more features. 
 
b. The edge threshold, or in other words the local extrema localisation 
threshold. If a feature value is below this threshold, it is considered as 
unstable, and is subsequently ignored. Bigger values accept more features.   
 
c. The remove boundary points parameter which is responsible for 
discarding the frames which are found near the image boundary point. 
 
3. Descriptor parameters: 
 
a. The magnification factor m. Each spatial bin has m? size and by changing 
the m value the spatial bin size is changed.  
 
b. The number of orientation bins. 
 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 35
c.  The number of spatial bins. This parameter defines the descriptors vector 
size, where it is equal to (Spatial Bins number)2 x (Orientation bins 
number), with radius of (Spatial Bins number)2 x m?/2. 
 
Returned Values: 
 
The SIFT function returns input image frames and descriptors. Both image frames and 
descriptors are vectors and are described as follows: 
 
1. Image SIFT frames vector is a 4xN matrix, which is storing one frame per column 
with the following format: 
 
a. FRAMES(1:2,n) describes the center of frame n in the position (x, y). 
b. FRAMES(3,n)  describes the scale ? of the frame n. 
c. FRAMES(4,n) describe the orientation ? of the frame n. 
 
2. Image SIFT descriptors is a KxN matrix and the default size of K=128. 
3.2.2 SIFT Scale Spaces 
  
Both SIFT detector and descriptor are designed based on the Gaussian Scale Space (GSS) 
of the input image I(x). The Gss scale space is described below and it is designed 
according to equations 1 and 2: 
 
  (26) ))(*(),( xIgxG ??
??
 
,where x is the spatial coordinate and ? the feature scale coordinate. The is the 
Gaussian kernel isotropic of ?2I variance. 
?g
 
The Gaussian scale space is computed in a function within the SIFT one, and is executed 
as DFD, shown in figure 15. The image has already been smoothed at a nominal level ?n 
prior to entering the Gaussian function, as already described in section 3.1 (part 1), and as 
a result:

The octaves pyramid is computed from the bottom incrementally. This is undertaken by 
successive convolutions which have small kernels. See table 1.

Consequently, the algorithm proceeds with the calculation of the difference of the 
Gaussian (DoG) scale space, which is computed in a separate function as long as 
Gaussian function execution is completed. The DoG scale space is simply the derivative 
of GSS scale ),( ?xG . The DoG represents the same image I(x) but at different levels of 
scale. The DoG scale space is described as follows, and it is designed based on equations 
3 and 4:

The scale ? domain is categorised in a series of logarithmic steps formed in O octaves. 
Each octave is then subdivided in sub-levels denoted as S. The discrimination between O 
and S is very important given that each successive octave which is found the data in that 
octave is spatially down sample by half [1, 7]. Both of them are identified by a discrete 
octave and sub-level index denoted as o and s, respectively. The octave o and sub-level s 
are mapped in the corresponding scale ? as follows: 
 
 
],1,...,0[],1,...,0[min
(29) 
 
 
,where ?0 is the base scale level, o is the octave index  and s the scale resolution. The 
existence of octaves with negative index is possible.

For the octave o computation the input image is doubled by bilinear interpolation, since 
the image already been pre-smoothed and ?n=1. The DoG scale space is 
, in order to detect all scales extrema. Also, in view of the fact that 
the DoG scale space is computed by Gaussian scale space differentiation, the most recent 
scaleÕs extrema is

[ ]1,1[], maxmin ???? Ssss . Thus, the number of octave O is set to cover 
all of the octavesÕ requirements. 
3.2.3 SIFT Detector and Descriptor  
 
As explained in the previous section, the SIFT detector is responsible for frames 
(keypoints) detection, which has been described in the theoretical background section 
2.2.2.3 [1]. The extracted frames are simply a set of image points (x, ?) generated from 
DoG scale space D(x, ?) local extremum. Each frame is further characterised by an 
orientation ? which is derived from Gaussian scale space G(x, ?).   
 
The difference between SIFT detector and descriptor is the difference in the ÒinterestÓ 
that each one shows in relation to the feature. In SIFT detector, each keypoint (x, ?) is 
weighted by gradient magnitude and a Gaussian window H(x) of deviation ?w = 1.5?, 
while in practice it is cropped at wx ?4? [1]. 
 
The keypoints detection is implemented in a different function, as described in the SIFT 
DFD illustration in figure 15. Keypoints are points of the local extremum of DoG scale 
space D(x, ?), and are extracted in this function by looking at 9x9x9 sample 
neighborhoods. The element whose value is greater from that of all the neighbors is 
returned. The return value is not the element value, but the element index. The number of 
keypoints extracted from each octave when an example image is processed (figure 13), is 
illustrated as a graph in figure 16. 
  
 
Figure 16: The local maxima keypoint of each DoG octave. The X-axis represents the number of processed 
octave and Y-axis the number of keypoints extracted. These results comprise the output of function 1 from 
DFD of figure 15.  
 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 38
Provided that the initial keypoints detection operation is completed, software delete all 
the points that are close to the binary one, as described in the SIFT function data 
flowchart diagram step two (2) [7]. The remaining keypoints are processed to the next 
step (DFD step 3).  The number of remaining points can be observed in the graph 
illustrated in figure 17.  
 
 
Figure 17: Any points found to be too close to the boundary are discarded. . This process is executed for 
each octave, but this does not necessarily mean that the results will change every time.  
 
The next step involves the keypointsÕ refining as well as the weak pointsÕ deletion. This 
procedure is executed in a separate function (DFD step 3).  Since keypoints have being 
extracted from the second step, they are now fitted to the local extremum through a 
quadratic interpolation process. Concurrently, the weak points are discarded. The process 
of selecting the weak points is carried out by checking the keypointsÕ strength, based on 
threshold t value and by examining the histogram maximum of the local extremum [1, 7]. 
The remaining keypoints number can be observed in the graph below, figure 18.  
 
 
Figure 18: By refining the keypoint location, weak points are discarded by checking the threshold strength 
and removing points found on the edges. 
 
The last step of the SIFT features detector is the keypoints orientation and storing in the 
FRAMES matrix. This was introduced in 3.2.1 (Output parameters) section and 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 39
illustrated in step 4 of the SIFT function DFD. For each keypoint (x, ?,) an orientation ? 
is computed as the gradientÕs predominant orientation within a window around the 
keypoint. This orientation value is computed by finding the histogram of the gradientÕs 
orientations maximum within the window around the keypoint. According to D.G. 
LoweÕs implementation, as explained in the theoretical background 2.2.2.3 section, the 
histogram is weighted the gradient magnitude and the Gaussian window both aligned in 
the center of the keypoint with ? =1.5 time the keypoint scale ? [1, 7]. The histogram is 
also pre-smoothed with an average filter. As long as the data are computed in the bins 
before the histogramÕs maximum computation, the histogram is pre-smoothed using an 
average filter. Each local maximum above zero point eight per cent (0.8%) of the global 
maximum is stored. Thus, it is possible to detect each image location and scale multiple 
SIFT frames. 
 
As soon as the SIFT detector operation is completed and the keypoints have been 
xtracted and stored in a 4xN matrix, the SIFT descriptors calculation is the next and last e
step of the function (DFD step 5). Each extracted keypoint is reflected by a descriptor. 
The SIFT keypoint (x, ?) descriptor is defined by the Gaussian scale space octave and it 
statistically describes the Gaussian scale space ),( ?xG gradient orientations. It is a 
gradient orientation histogram, where the histogram domains are the tuples (x, ?). All 
descriptors are stored in a two dimensional (2-D) array, where each column describes the 
corresponding extracted feature. As in D.G. LoweÕs implementation, each histogram 
consisted of eight (8) bins in relation to orientation. Thus, No = 8 where each descriptor 
consisted of an array of four (4) histograms around the corresponding keypoint, hence Np 
= 4. This leads to the computation of the SIFT feature descriptor vector, whereby 
1282 ?op NN [1, 7]. Indeed, as mentioned earlier, this can change since the number of bins 
N  can be modified by the programmer. The descriptor vector is returned by the SIFT 
n though it is not always necessary to be used for matching. In general, it is 
constructive in the evaluation step, when the proposed method is compared with other 
approaches which also employ SIFT algorithm for image feature recognition. 
 
The resulting extracted features are illustrated in the input image as arrow

illustrated in figures 19 and 20, respectively.

What is meant by ÒPerfectÓ image? 
 
In the introduction of this section, mention was made to the need for a ÒperfectÓ image to 
achieve the best feature detection. This definition does not refer exclusively to a large and 
a high contrast image, but to an image with the correct illumination at the correct 
viewpoint. A new question arises from this one, that is how the user or the companyÕs 
client know which is the best capture viewpoint and thus to help SIFT to extract the 
greatest number of possible features. The ÒperfectÓ image does not refer to the image that 
the client must upload, but rather to the database image. The database must be updated 
with images that extract all the required keypoints from the image. An example is an 
electrical connector with pins and input holes. These connector details must be detected 
by the SIFT. Nonetheless, if the illumination is insufficient in relation to the detailed 
points of the components or there is a reflection, then no effective features will extracted, 
thus leading to  bad matching results, as shown in  figures 21 and 22. 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 41
  
 
Figure 21: 148 SIFT features are extracted. It is 
important to observe the symmetry of the features 
within the component holes and pins. 
Figure 22: 192 SIFT features are extracted. Only 
some of the detailed points are extracted and few of 
them are symmetrical, especially in the pins where 
reflection exists. 
3.3 Match by Correlation (MbC) 
 
This section describes the implementation of match by means of a correlation technique. 
This technique is also implemented in a separate function. Match by correlation 
technique is mainly processed when the SIFT operation is over and the distinctive image 
features have been extracted. This is responsible for the putative (theoretical) matches 
between the two imagesÕ keypoints, as already referred to in the theoretical background 
section 2.3. During this step, the initial matches between the two images keypoints data 
set are processed, followed by a second step of point matching, which is explored in the 
next section, this being the RANSAC algorithm. The keypoint matching in this part of the 
software is not expected to be one hundred per cent (100%) accurate, since there is no 
involvement of a distance measurement criterion in the matching selection process. A 
detailed description of the match by correlation procedure can be observed in the data 
flow chart diagram of figure 23. 
 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 42
 
 
Figure 23: DFD of match by correlation technique function. 
3.3.1 MbC Function Input and Output Parameters  
 
Match by correlation function (MbC) is a straightforward function with simple tasks and 
it involves a short list of input parameters and returned values, as described below: 
 
Input Parameters: 
 
1. The two input images where the SIFT features belong to. 
 
2. The coordinates of the extracted SIFT features from both input images. These 
coordinates are 2xN number of inputs arrays (f1 and f2), where the first row 
describes x-axis and the second row describes the y-axis coordinate. The tow 
arrays of features are not expected to have the same number of points, since 
the number of extracted features can vary for each image.   
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 43
 
3. The correlation window size denoted as w. The window size is a square with 
the center of the window the feature under correlation. Thus, the window 
value should be an odd number. 
 
Returned Values: 
 
1. The coordinate of points that are considered as putative matches and selected 
from SIFT feature arrays (f1 and f2). The form of each new array p1 and p2 is 
the same as that in the input features arrays, where the first row describes the 
x-axis and the second row describes the y-axis coordinate. 
 
2. The matched points array. This array holds the indices of f1 and f2 array 
considered to form a putative match. The correlation map is a 2xN array, 
where the first row gives the number of element points relative to the 
corresponding feature array for the first image. In a similar way, the second 
row relates to the second image. This array is solely used at the end of the 
program (after RANSAC is completed), when the matched point will have 
been spotted at each image, thus illustrating the matches.  
 
3.3.2 MbC Operation and Correlation Map 
 
The MbC algorithm function processing steps are executed in the DFD sequence shown 
in figure 25 and are a replication of the technique introduced above in the theoretical 
background section 2.3. A second image will be used in this section, with the objective of 
facilitating an investigation into the working of the MbC technique. This image includes 
some of the objects of the first image used in the SIFT section, but with some minor 
changes in scaling and orientation, see figures 24, 25.  
  
Figure 24: Input image with size of 391x251 pixels. 
This is the second image used. 
Figure 25: SIFT features as detected and extracted. 
245 keypoints are extracted from input image in 
0.001 seconds.  
3.3.2.1 Average Filter Ð Step 1 
 
In the first step of the function (DFD step 1), an average filter of w2 is applied in the pre-
smoothed image and subtracted by itself. This filter is a FIR filter and it helps to improve 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 44
image contrast by balancing the brightness of each image, thus increasing the efficiency 
in the correlation process which follows in the next step, see figures 26(a, b). 
 
 
Figure 26(a): Image 1 before and after the FIR average filter is applied. The result shows that the 
brightness is reduced in order to enhance the contrast. 
 
 
Figure 26(b): Image 2 before and after the FIR average filter is applied. The result shows that the 
brightness is reduced in order to enhance the contrast. 
3.3.2.2 Computing Correlation Map Ð Step 2 
 
Afterwards, the two images including the corresponding SIFT features matrices, are used 
as an input for the function that will generate the correlation map (DFD step 2). This 
function is the most time-consuming part in the MbC function. All the pointÕs correlation 
computations are performed, as already described in section 2.3. 
 
The correlation map is a function that will compute a correlation matrix. This correlation 
matrix stores the correlation strength of every imageÕs previously extracted keypoint, 
relative to every other point of the second image. This computation may increase the 
application overheat; nevertheless it is indispensable. 
 
At the beginning of the correlation map computation, the correlation matrix values are 
initialised to infinity. This is undertaken in order to facilitate the later step, during which 
the computation ends and the non-paired values (those that are still points to infinity), 
will be ignored.  
 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 45
The next step involves the calculation of correlation windows ÒradiusÓ, r. As mentioned 
before, the window size value is declared by the programmer since it is set as an input 
parameter which must be an odd number. The computation of this radius is defined as 
follows:  
 
 
2/)1(,1)2*( (30) ? ?? wrww ?
 
Provided that the w and r have been calculated, the processing flow continues with the 
next step, which consists of finding the pointÕs indices which are at distance r from the 
image boundary points. The pointÕs indices are stored in a 1xN array for each image 
separately whereby each array is not expected to have the same size.  
 
The next step is the most important one in relation to in correlation windows computation 
and matching. This step is described in detail in the correlation map function data 
flowchart diagram, as illustrated in figure 27. 
 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 46
 
 
Figure 27: DFD of correlation map generation function. This function is an implementation of correlation 
technique, firstly introduced in section 2.3. 
 
Once the pointÕs indices have been computed and stored, the software will commence the 
building of the correlation map array. This step is very simple;yet it is still an essential 
one given that  all of the effective job is executed here. For each point in the indices array 
a square window of points is generated and pre-normalised to unit vector. This window 
transformation increases the speed and the accuracy of the result [R16].  Thereafter, the 
computed pointÕs window is used for the normalised correlation computation in relation 
to every element from the second image indices array. Normalised correlation is selected 
since it overcomes the problems faced by the normalised correlation position limitation 
[R16], as mentioned in the theoretical background in section 2.3.3.   
 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 47
As soon as all the iterations are completed, the correlation map is returned to the MbC 
function to continue with the pointsÕ matching.  
3.3.2.3 Finding Strongest and Consistent Matches Ð Step 3 
 
In this step, where the correlation map is computed, the software will compute the indices 
of the maximum values along rows in f2 for each f1, in the manner these arrays were 
introduced in 3.3.1 Input Parameters section. The maximum values along columns in f1 
for each f2 are also computed. The remaining indices are stored in separate arrays, these 
being indices 1 and indices 2. 
 
Afterwards, matches which are consisted in both directions will be determined, by 
checking whether an element of indices 2 array exists in indices 1. If the result is positive, 
the point is selected and added in indices point array p1 and p2, introduced according to 
3.3.1 Return Values section. The results obtained in this step are showed below in figure 
28. 
 
Figure 28: The number of points detected before the matching process is illustrated by bars in red colour 
for each image. 335 and 245 points have been detected for the first and second images, respectively. After 
the matching step, it was found that only 60 of them matched (green colour bars).  
 
Once the matching process is completed, the MbC function stores and returns the 
matched points. Then, the putative matches array is used by the main program to 
illustrate the common points between the two images, see figure 29. 
 
 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 48
Figure 29: The result of Match by Correlation (MbC) function is illustrated. The results are fairly good (60 
points matched), but as it can be observed, there are points that were wrongly detected as common (red 
line). In this step of the application, a small amount of false matches is to be expected. The whole MbC 
procedure is completed in 2.411 seconds.  
3.2.3.4 MbC Weakness Issue and Solution  
 
As it has already been explained in the theoretical background section, normalised 
correlation was used instead of un-normalised one, in order to overcome scaling and 
rotation issues. After some basic tests with the MbC function, it was found that 
normalised correlation is not invariant. Instead, it is very weak when there is a difference 
of over twenty degrees (20¡) between the imagesÕ orientation, and moreover it becomes 
unstable over fifteen degrees (15¡).  The conclusion for this weakness arises after some 
basic test with the MbC function, using images with scaling and rotation difference. The 
rotation issue can be verified by observing the results obtained from images in figures 
30(a-m).  
 
 
 
Figure 30(a): The image on the right was scaled and its size was reduced. The above image shows the 
detection of SIFT frames.  Scaling does not affect SIFT frames detection. The number of extracted 
descriptors for the first image (left side) is 804 and for the second one 508. 
 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 49
 
Figure 30(b): Scaling does not affect the MbC technique. The number of putative matches (PM) is 175. 
 
Figure 30(c): In the second test, two identical images were used to examine the rotation issue. The reason 
behind the use of identical images is to minimise the possibility of matching being affected by other 
factors. The number of extracted SIFT frames is 804 for both images.

PM = Putative matches number 
MR = Matching Rate 
 
About this example: The matching rate is calculated by using a percentage formula. Since the number of 
extracted points is the same in both images, the matching rate is calculated with the following formula: 
 
   
erFramesNumb
mberPutativeNuMR ?? 100  (31) 
 
In this example it is important to observe the matched pointÕs dispersion. The green line defines a matching 
between two points. As rotation increases in the first image, the matching ratio is reduced and the accuracy 
starts to fail.  
 
The solution of this problem is achieved by rotating the window before it is correlated 
with the second image window. Each rotated window will form a different correlation 
map, and in the end the ÒstrongestÓ map will be returned for the matching procedure. The 
new question which arises is what is the criterion to be used by the software in order to 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 51
decide which is the ÒstrongestÓ correlation map? In each rotated window (image 1), the 
software will check the extent of correlation in every window within the second image. In 
the end, the degree value with the most successful correlations will be selected. This 
check will be performed by using one of the MATLAB build-in functions for the 
computation of a two dimensional (2D) cross correlation coefficient [28]. This function is 
simply the programmatical implementation of equation 18. The efficiency and generally 
the evaluation of this method will be discussed and explored in the last sections of the 
evaluation and conclusions discussion. 
 
As previously explained, each window will be rotated before being correlated. The 
significant issue which arises from this rotation is that the window size will change an 
outcome which will lead to the forced and unsuccessful end of the application. For this 
reason, each rotated window is also cropped and thus keeps its original window 
dimensions, as calculated in the beginning. The way that the windows will look like is 
showed in figures 31 and 32. 
 
   
0¡ 20¡ 40¡ 60¡ 80¡ 100¡ 
Figure 31: Windows of the first image after ÒpureÓ rotation. The first window from 
the left (0¡) is the original window before rotation. 
 
      
0¡ 20¡ 40¡ 60¡ 80¡ 100¡ 
Figure 32: Rotated windows of the first image are now cropped. There is no 
change in the first window from the left (0¡), since it is formed as a complete 
square. As the window rotation comes closer to the four quadrants (90¡, 180¡, 
270¡, 360¡), the existence of black (dead) pixels is reduced. 
   
Observing the results, it becomes clear that in view of the fact that the window is 
cropped, some of its information will be lost. The lost information is replaced by white or 
black pixels. Since the pixels are white or black, this means that the correlation 
coefficient computation will produce different results, which affect the correct angle 
selection.  
 
To overcome the above problem, a larger window is selected, which is approximately 1.5 
times larger that the original one, which is rotated and cropped. Because this window is 
larger it holds more information, thus, when it is cropped the window which is produced 
will be formed only by image pixels, without the addition of any ÒdeadÓ pixels (this being 
a pixel added to replace the cropped one). The correlation coefficient calculation will be 
computed between the cropped window and the second image window, both having the 
same size. In the correlation step, the initial small-cropped window must be used; 
otherwise the reference to the image keypoints will be wrong. The window 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 52
transformation is illustrated in figure 33 whilst the window matching procedure is 
represented in figure 34. 
 
 
 
Figure 33: The window on the left side is the window (1) that is used for computing the second window 
(2), so as to overcome the problem of black pixels, and thus wrong calculations in correlation coefficient. 
The third window (3) will be employed once the correlation map has been build.  
 
 
 
Figure 34: In the above example, during the window matching procedure, the window which has a 100¡ 
rotation is selected. The comparison with the window of the second image is performed using correlation 
coefficient technique, as this is described in equation 18.  
 
As mentioned before, as the rotation in an image comes closer to four quadrants, the 
number of black pixels added in the rotated correlation window is reduced. Thus, more 
image details are correlated. On the other hand, as the image rotation comes closer to the 
middle of a quadrant the number of added pixels increases, and a result of this image 
details are lost. In this case, the availability of the keypoints is reduced since some of 
them are lost. On the basis of this fact, the number of matched points is also reduced.  
 
By using the image of the previous example, the new updated MbC technique is tested, 
examining its behavior in the context of large image rotation, see figures 35-39(a,b). 
More tests and results will be explored in the course of the Testing and Evaluation 
section.

3.4 RANSAC Features based Matching Verification  
 
This section describes the implementation of the RANSAC algorithm. RANSAC is 
implemented in a separate function and it is responsible for estimating the inliers from the 
putative matchesÕ data set. Since the data set comes from putative matches, a 
considerable percentage of this set will be rejected by RANSAC. 
 
The RANSAC algorithm involves the collaboration between the Epipolar geometry and 
the Fundamental matrix model. In this collaboration, the Epipolar geometry technique is 
firstly used to compute epipoles between two images, and then the fundamental matrix 
model steps in to encapsulate the intrinsic geometry [17, 29]. In other words, the 
fundamental matrix is the algebraic representation of Epipolar geometry [29].  As soon as 
the inliers set has been computed, the matching rate between the two images is calculated 
to define whether the two images share common objects.  
 
This procedure is separated into two parts, these being the general computations and the 
RANSAC algorithm (probabilistic part) implementation. This is necessitated by the fact 
that the epipoles as well as the fundamental matrix must be computed first. For this 
reason, it was deemed as more convenient and efficient to fragment the program into in 
smaller parts.  
 
The algorithm (probabilistic part) operation is illustrated in the data flowchart diagram 
(DFD) in figure 11, and explained in section 2.4.3 of the theoretical background. Both 
RANSAC procedure parts are illustrated in figures 40 and 41, respectively.

3.4.1 RANSAC Function Input and Output Parameters  
 
Input Parameters: 
 
1. The coordinates of the putative matches points for each image, which are p1 
and p2. These arrays are the output of the MbC function, which located the 
putative matches between the two images. 
 
2. A threshold value, t. This is the distance threshold between the putative 
keypoint and the computed model. This threshold will be used as the criterion 
to decide whether a point is an inlier or not.  The importance of this parameter 
is that the point coordinates are normalised to the mean distance from the 
origin. Thus, the threshold value must be set relative to this between 0.001 Ð 
0.01. 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 56
 
Returned Values: 
 
1. A 3x3 fundamental matrix can compute and illustrate the epipoles lines, 
especially where verification is needed. 
 
2. An array of inliers. This is a one dimensional (1D) array which holds the 
inliers that come from the putative matchesÕ arrays. Because it is a one 
dimensional (1D) array, in the end it will be decoded into a two dimensional 
(2D) array, and hence, it will include the coordinates of each inlier. 
 
3.4.2 RANSAC Function Operation  
3.4.2.1 Normalizing the Data  
 
 As it can be seen from both data flow chart diagrams, the most complicate part of the 
algorithm is executed in the second function, where the actual operation of the RANSAC 
algorithm is processed. However, this operation is simple to understand as long as the 
Epipolar geometry and fundamental matrix model theories have been comprehended.  
 
The RANSAC function starts with a normalisation procedure, where each set of the 
putative matches is normalised, so that each setÕs center is at the origin and their mean 
distance from the origin is 2 . This normalisation technique is used to improve the 
conditioning of any equation involved and to solve fundamental matrices.    
3.4.2.2 RANSAC Main Operation 
 
 As explained in section 2.4, the RANSAC algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm, which 
selects a random data set Si within the putative matchesÕ data set, and estimates the 
number of inliers. This procedure will be executed until the greatest number of inliers is 
found relative to the probability value that has been set. The probability value is not given 
as a function argument, and consequently it is not in the user option. Therefore, it has 
been set to the best probability so that a data set Si with the most inliers is selected.  
 
The main operation consists of five (5) steps. Each step is composed of other smaller 
steps (function). The structure of these steps and their order of stepsÕ execution is 
described in the DFD of figure 42 (colored lines). 
 
 Provided that the parameters have been initialised, the algorithm is executed. This 
execution uses two (2) loops. The first loop will be repeated until the probability of the 
largest set of inliers is found and every computation is involved in this loop. The first step 
of this iterative process (first loop) is the generation of a random data set, consisting by 
eight (8) points.   The degeneration procedure (DFD steps 1-4) starts by generating a 
random data set Si and testing whether these points within the data set are not in 
degeneration form (step 1). The degeneration test is performed to determine whether the 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 57
selected set of the matched points will result in a degeneracy form in the fundamental 
matrix model calculation, as required by RANSAC [35].  
 
If the set Si is degenerate, then the randomly selected data will be used in order to build 
their fundamental matrix model. The resulting model will be checked whether it has a 
successful fit or not.  Moreover, this is a good way to determine if the data is degenerate 
or not (step 2).   
 
When the degeneration fails a model is formed. The computed model is verified by 
checking the distances between the points and the indices returned by the model. The 
length of the model returned indices is computed thus defining the number of inliers (step 
3).  
 
In the next step (step 4), the program checks whether the computed inliers number is the 
best so far. If the result is positive it stores the current fundamental model and 
corresponding inliers for the next check. The number of trials is now computed with the 
objective of ensuring that the data set Si was selected with probability p and does not 
include any outliers. The calculation of this probability is defined by the following 
equation: 
 
(32) 
)log(
)1log(
outliersp
pN ??  
 
Provided that the probability of selecting the most successful model is satisfied and the 
inliers set has been computed, the next step is to determine whether the given solution is 
valid. This can be achieved by simply checking the model data in order to decide whether 
they are valid numbers. If the numbers are valid, the best model together with the best 
inliers set is returned; otherwise, a null model and a null inliers array are returned, thus 
notifying that there are no valid matches between the two images (step 5). An example 
with a large number of outliers, where RANSAC is used for inliers estimation can be 
observed in figure 42(a,b).  
 
Figure 42(a): In this image, 103 
putative matched points are found. 
The correlation window technique 
is disabled, thus creating a larger 
number of outliers which test the 
RANSAC performance. 
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 58
 Figure 42(b): In this image, 83 
inliers are found and 20 putative 
points are discarded. Based on the 
matching rate formula of equation 
31 the matching rate is estimated at 
81%. 
 
3.4.2.3 Calculating and Demoralizing the Fundamental Model 
 
After the computation of the fundamental model and the inliers of the given set, the 
fundamental matrix of the inliers set relative to the putative matches is computed. This 
fundamental matrix computation is essential because it can be used in the matching 
verification. With this computation, the Epipolar line can be calculated and illustrated 
between the two images, thus making possible the observation of the matched points one 
by one, as shown in figure 44(a, b). The fundamental matrix must be demoralised before 
it is returned to the main program. If the fundamental matrix is denoted with F, then its 
demoralization is defined by: 
 
(33)

where N1 and N2 are the normalised matrices computed relatively to their putative 
matches sets, this being image 1 and image 2, respectively.

Figure 43(b): Epipolar line 2. 
 
Figure 43(a, b): Epipolar lines for the first and second (20¡ rotation) images. The calculation of epipoles 
for both images is performed after the RANSAC completion. The number of Epipolar lines that can be 
drawn can be as many as the number of inliers found. In this example there are 83 lines. 
3.4.2.4 Matching Rate Calculation 
 
After the RANSAC function completion, the putative matches and inliers sets are 
employed for the calculation of two images matching ratio. This rate value is used to 
define whether two images have common objects. Even if the RANSAC returns a set of 
inliers, this does not mean that the two images are common. For this reason, it is 
important that a matching rate is to be calculated. Consequently, its values are used as a 
matching threshold to define whether the two images match. Depending on the three user 
requirements and by setting the matching ratio value as a threshold where values below 
that are considered as Ònot matchedÓ, the user can make the application as distinctive as 
he wants.    
 
The matching rateÕs (MR) calculated approach is the same one as in equation 31. The 
result is obtained by using the following equation: 
 
 
 
mberPutativeNu
berInliersNumMR ?? 100 (34) 
The matching decision is not based only on the result of this formula. Assuming that an 
image I1 is compared with images I2 and I3, and the matching ratio of I1-to-I2 is seventy 
nine per cent (79%), with 480 putative matches and 380 inliers, and the result of I1-to-I3 
is ninety per cent (90%) with ten (10) putative matches and nine (9) inliers, the 
application will recognise and select I1-to-I2 as the most successful matching. The 
selection of the correct matching decision cannot be based only on the MR result, 
especially when an image is compared with more than one, like the company example 
where it will be examined with thousands of images. However, the number of inliers 
found will be considered to determine the most accurate matching result. More test 
examples will be explored and discussed in the next section.

4. Experimental Results and Analysis 
  
In this section, the proposed method for object matching is tested and any result obtained 
is statistically analysed. Every test contains all of the three algorithms; SIFT [1], Cross 
Correlation Matching (MbC) [25] and RANSAC [9]. The correlation window of MbC 
method was set to 23x23, a random large size, thus to increase the performance when 
there is a large translation between the compared images. All tests are implemented in 
MATLAB R2010a and the proposed method will be tested under different images 
conditions, as image rotation, translation and large scaling. Images used for any other 
equivalent object matching technique will be used in this section, thus to help in the 
evaluation section for the comparison of the proposed method with its predecessors. Also 
images captured from real electrical components supplied by RS Company are tested. 
Some of this components contain a defect, thus to test how efficient and accurate the 
application can be when details from an object have been destroyed. Additional tests are 
however described through this section.  
 
During all the tests, the computer with the follow requirements was used: 
 
? Intel Pentium M 725 at 1.6 GHz processor 
? 1.5 GB RAM of 166 MHz max bandwidth  
 
For each test application, both illustration results and a feedback report is provided, see 
figure 44. The illustrations are presented in each testÕs results section and the feedback 
report is converted to a table, thus only the resulting important information is collected.

4.1 Testing Using Random Images 
 
In this section, randomly selected images as buildings, landscapes and images that used 
for the evaluation of other object matching applications will be testing the effectiveness 
of the proposed method. See figures 45(a-c). 
4.1.1 Identical Images Affected by Scaling and Translation  
 
In this example, two identical images were used. The second image was affected by 
scaling, translation and change in perspective. See figures 45(a-c). Both images are 
converted to grayscale when the application starts, as it is explained in 3.1 (step1).The 
imagesÕ properties are shown in table 3:

4.1.1.1 Results 
Figure 45(a): Shows the extracted SIFT frames for each image. Because the second image is affected by 
scaling, translation and change in perspective, the image pixels form has changes, thus SIFT to detect some 
different frames than in the first original image (Right image at left down and right top corners  Each arrow

4.1.1.2 Analysis 
 
The results obtained (tables 4, 5) from the first test shows that the proposed method can 
effectively extract and detect the common points between the two images. The SIFT 
algorithm results show that image scaling, translation and the change in the viewpoint 
affecting the number of the keypoints that can be extracted. However the matching results 
show that SIFT is invariant in these three image transitions. In Match by correlation 
(MbC) technique, the optimisation performed in correlation windows for invariance in 
rotation was disabled, thus avoiding the adding of extra overhead. Even if the rotation 
optimisation was disabled, the MbC matching was fairly accurate since only ten (10) of 
the putative matches were discarded by RANSAC with a matching rate of 82%. 
Considering time execution, the SIFT and the RANSAC algorithms are very fast with 
execution time less than a 1/10 of a second. The MbC method is responsible for most of 
the time overhead since it has the higher rate in execution time of about 200 time more 
than the average of SIFT and RANSAC execution time. This high overhead rate is 
because of the fact that MbC method is processing the image iteratively until the putative 
matches are computed.  
 
4.1.2 Landscape Images Affected by Rotation  
 
In this example, two landscape images of the same plan but of different perspective were 
used. Both of the images were captured in a shadowy environment, thus to reduce the 
image brightness. The second image was rotated by a 100¡, thus to create a large 
difference between the orientation of the two images, figures 46(a-c). Both images are 
converted to grayscale when the application starts, as it is explained in 3.1 (step1).The 
images properties are shown in table 6:

length and orientation is the frame scale and orientation. 
Figure 46(b): Shows the interconnection of points that MbC technique considers as putative matches 
between the two images. As it can be observed, there is a big set of wrong matches between the two

Table 8: Shows the SIFT, Match by Correlation (MbC) and RANSAC execution 
time in seconds. The application total time includes any other function call. 
4.1.2.2 Analysis 
 
The results (tables 7, 8) show that the proposed application is invariant in rotation. The 
SIFT algorithm proved its invariance in rotation since a very big number of frames has 
been extracted. The correlation rotation option has been enabled in this example, in order 
to be able make the application invariant in rotation. The results show that the MbC 
technique is effective in rotation, however the application speed test shows that the MbC 
increases the overhead when this option is enable. The RANSAC algorithm discards a 
large amount of inliers, but three (3) of them are ÒescapeÓ and considered as inliers.    
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 66
4.1.3 Landscape Images with Different Viewpoint   
 
In this example two landscape images were used of the same plan but with different 
image condition. These conditions involve a different view point, rotation and light 
scaling. This image is one of the images found in any paper related to object matching. 
Both of the images captured in a darker environment, thus to reduce the image brightness. 
The second image was captured with a 20¡ rotation and then re-rotated another 120¡, thus 
to create a large difference between the orientation of the two images, see figure 47(a-c) 
Both images are converted to grayscale when the application starts, as it is explained in 
3.1 (step1).The images properties are shown in table 9:

4.1.3.1 Results 
Figure 47(a): Shows the extracted SIFT frames for each image. The second image has a big difference in 
view point, about 10¡ rotation and light scaling. Because the second image is scaled, less number of SIFT 
frames are extracted, but it is still invariant under those conditions. Each arrow describes a SIFT frame, 
where the arrow length and orientation is the frame scale and orientation.

4.1.3.2 Analysis 
 
The results (tables 10, 11) of these tests show that the proposed method can be also 
effective under the images conditioned as described in the test description. The SIFT 
algorithm continues to be invariant and fast. The big difference in the viewpoint 
including scaling and rotation did not affect the results. The MbC method with the 
invariance in rotation option enabled, shows that a large number of putative matches can 
be detected, but as the rotation invariance option is enabled and the SIFT frames number 
increases, the time overhead is increased dramatically. The RANSAC algorithm shows 
that it can detect the inliers, but also in this test due to the images background 
commonality, some outliers are considered as inliers. 
4.2 Testing Using Real RS Company Components Images 
 
In this part of the testing section, real images from electrical components provided by RS 
Electronics Company will be tested. A series of componentsÕ images was captured, thus 
to create a temporary database of components. This components database was used to 
check if the client component image (that was captured by him), match with any 
components from the database. The form of the database is a template image including a 
series of identical component images (smaller) from different perspectives, thus the client 
does not have any bounds and limitation in a specific point of view.   
This part of the testing section is simulating how well the proposed application can be 
used for RS company requirements.    
4.2.1 Defected Component Image VS Database  
 
In this example, a defected component image (client image) captured in a low light 
environment,  is compared with the identical database image. The defected component 
has bent and soldered pins. Database images are image captured that are considered 
ÒperfectÓ as this definition is introduced in section 3.2.4. See figures48 (a-c). Both 
images are converted to grayscale when the application starts, as it is explained in 3.1 
(step1).The imagesÕ properties are shown in table 12:

4.2.1.1 Analysis 
 
The results (tables 13, 14) of the tested components prove that as a first step the proposed 
method is effective when matching accuracy is required. The SIFT algorithm  still 
extracts successfully image features even in the defective image. The MbC method 
responds to putative matchesÕ detection. The correlation window rotation option is not 
required any more, since the image is tested within all possible perspectives within the 
database. 
The RANSAC algorithm discards the outliers, with only three (3) to ÒescapeÓ and be 
considered as inliers. The execution time result is fairly good, since only a second is 
needed for the object matching operation. 
4.2.3 RS Company Electrical Almost Identical Components 
 
In this example an object will be checked with itself from the record and with almost an 
identical one from the database. Both tests should succeed but it is expected the identical 
(left image) one to perform with higher matching rate than the almost identical. The 
difference between the two objects is that, one has more input terminals than the other. 
The pattern of the terminals is the same, thus making the final matching result more 
difficult. This is a very good test for application accuracy and performance, when almost 
identical objects are tested, figures 49(a-f). Both images are converted to grayscale when 
the application starts, as it is explained in 3.1 (step1). The images properties are shown in

The application total time includes any other function call for both tests. The results under database 1 
and 2 columns are relative to image 1, which is the examined object. 
 
4.2.3.2 Analysis 
 
The results (tables 16,17) obtained from both tests verify the effectiveness of the 
application when almost identical objects are examined for their similarities. The SIFT 
algorithm extracts a large number of features, since in each database image eight (8) 
objects but in different perspective were included. Giventhe big number of extracted 
points, the SIFT algorithm execution time was less than 1 second. The MbC method 
executes the putative matches as it is expected but the large number of SIFT frames add 
extra latency in the execution, thus increasing the application execution time. 
Improvements in speed and how the overhead can be reduced will be explored in future 
work and in the improvements section. 
 
5. Critical Evaluation 
 
Through this section a critical evaluation of the project is explored. This is an analysis of 
the project objectives and whether or not the objectives have been achieved, as well if the 
choices that were made were the best and most successful.  
 
A comparison of the proposed method with other object matching techniques will be 
performed, thus to evaluate the result of the proposed method based in this field area.

5.1 Project Objectives Evaluation 
 
The primary aim of this project was to design and develop an effective application that 
will be able to decide whether two or more images match, calculate matching ratio and 
determine their common object. However, the project was split in two objectives. 
The first objective was to define the collaboration between the algorithms selected from 
the research skills study, thus to be able to achieve the solution. This objective can be 
considered as successful and was achieved by finding the mathematical relation between 
the three algorithms. This relation was accomplished by deciding that a transformation 
between the input and the output of the algorithms must be performed. The output of one 
algorithm must be a valid input of the next. Regarding the SIFT algorithm, its output 
frames (keypoints) were stored in an array as an x-y coordinate points and then used by 
match by correlation (MbC) technique as input. Then MbC method calculates the 
putative matches between the two images and outputs this as points, which are then used 
by RANSAC algorithm, which estimated the inliers.  
 
The second objective and most complicated was to replicate and optimise these 
algorithms, as well as to implement their collaboration in a program. Any algorithm 
optimisation that might be found necessary for the solution of any problem found during 
the implementation was also included in this objective. This objective was completed and 
can be also considered as successful as it met its requirement of the programming 
implementation of each algorithm. Each algorithm was operating in a different function 
designed in MATLAB and the proposed collaboration method defined in the first 
objective was accomplished. The correct collaboration between the three algorithms was 
very essential since the interchanged data should not change while moving between the 
algorithms. This sub-objective was accomplished successfully without any lost or 
distortion of data, thus the calculation of the matching rate at the end of the program was 
not affected. The application invariance in rotation, scaling, translation and change to 
view point requirement has been met by the correct algorithm implementation and 
collaboration. The rotation issue of MbC method was solved by implement a correlation 
window technique as it is explained in the implementation section. 
 
The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified in the test section, where the 
results show that the second project objective, invariance to image different changes, has 
been met. The invariant to rotation issue that was detected in MbC was solved. 
The results verify the proposed method performance with the average of succession rate 
up to 76%, between the tests. This result was obtained are illustrated in the graph in 
figure 5o. 
  
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 75
 
Figure 50: Shows the matching rate of each test with average of 76%. 
 
In addition, when the application execution time is considered, there are some issues 
since the number of SIFT frames and the rotation invariance option increases the time 
overhead. However, the application efficiency can be improved and this is discussed in 
the next section. The applicationÕs total execution time for each test are illustrated in the 
graph of figure 51.

 5.2 Evaluating Comparing to Other Methods 
 
In this section, the proposed method is compared with other object matching techniques. 
This comparison is performed to evaluate the performance of the application, thus to 
determine its competitiveness.  
 
The image used in test 4.1.3, is from the public domain resources of INRIA and was used 
to compare the proposed method with the one proposed in [25]. The application was also 
tested over the following methods: 
 
? Image matching by SIFT - Matching algorithm suggested by D.G. Lowe [1] and 
implemented by A. Vedali [33]. 
? Image matching by monogenic phase implemented by P. Kovesi [31]. 
 
These three methods are tested using the images from test 4.1.1 Ðto 5.2.3. The monogenic 
phase is a putative matchesÕ detection method, so RANSAC was used for inliers 
estimation. The SIFT matching algorithm replace both MbC and RANSAC. For feature 
detections project, SIFT was used in all cases. The algorithm proposed in paper [25] is 
compared by using the results given in the publication paper for the image found in test 
4.1.3. See table 18.

Table 18: Shows the results of each algorithm in each test.  
 
The monogenic phase algorithm detects much more putative matches than MbC but from 
the results one can observe that the matching rate when collaborating RANSAC is very 
low. Considering the speed test result is in the same level with the MbC, but MbC is 
much more effective. 
  
Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering 77
When comparing the proposed method with SIFT matching we can see that SIFT 
matching algorithm detects more matched points. When it was tested in real components 
images its performance reduced dramatically, which means it is unstable. Also, it is very 
important to mention that SIFT matching algorithm allows one point to match more than 
one time, and this is the reason of the large number of points matched. Considering 
speed, it is much more efficient than the proposed method. The reason is, because it uses 
frames descriptor for distances calculation, thus reducing the interaction with the image 
which is adding more delay.  
 
When the proposed method is compared with the normalised cross-correlation (NCC) 
method in the number of extracted points for the 4.1.3 test, the proposed method detects 
more points but observing the resulted images some of them are outliers. The results are 
not adequate to examine the two methods completely, but considering accuracy, the NCC 
method was more successful and considering detection skills, the proposed method is 
more successful.

6. Improvements and Future Work 
 
Future work and improvements of the proposed method are explored in this section. The 
proposed method verifies its effectiveness when accuracy and performance are required. 
However, there is potential for improvements, especially when considering application 
efficiency. Future work and spending more time in the application is required to improve 
the performance and the efficiency, by exploring any other image processing techniques 
that may be found useful. 
 
6.1 Improvements in Efficiency and Performance 
 
By observing the tests, it is very clear that there is a delay in the MbC function execution. 
This delay reduction is crucial since the application is destined for a company ordering 
department. The company database holds thousands of images which means that it must 
be processed quickly. A way to reduce this delay and make the application fast is by 
using parallel connections., The application runs efficiently on a computer cluster or a 
grid of networked computer by using this toolbox, without changing any parts of the code 
[32]. Considering that a computer cluster can have up to 16 cores, it means that the 
application can run in 16 parallel connections, which will increase the process. 
 
In addition, improvements in correlation window rotation option can increase the 
application efficiency and performance. The method can be re-considered and re-
implemented thus to find a way to make it faster and more accurate. By analysing the 
MbC function, the parts of the code that produce most of the delay can be detected. The 
next step is to re-implement them considering performance and efficiency.  
 
6.2 Future Work 
 
The RS Company database contains components of real images as well as 3D graphical 
models for each image. After some initial tests of the SIFT algorithm in 3D graphical 
models, the results were very optimistic, since SIFT frames are extracted from all the 
detail points of the components, thus creating ÒperfectÓ samples. Further tests involving 
the whole application will help to explore all the possible cases for any different approach 
in object matching image processing.  See figure 52.

 7. Conclusions 
 
A new method is presented for matching two uncalibrated images. The method employs 
rotation and scale invariance, extracting and detecting distinctive features from images. 
Rotation and scaling invariance issues were solved. The application is implemented in 
MATLAB R2010a and tested in a single core PC. Image captured environment is 
affecting the application performance and efficiency. When more features are extracted 
and rotation affects the testing image, the total execution time is increased. Experimental 
results on real RS company electrical connectors images, verify the effectiveness of the 
application with respect of accuracy and performance. By comparing the proposed 
method with other object matching techniques it was observed that it can be very robust 
against its opponents and in some case more successful, especially when accuracy is the 
judgment criterion. There is however, potential for improvements which were proposed 
in future work.
